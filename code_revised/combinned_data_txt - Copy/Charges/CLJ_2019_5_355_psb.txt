The accused, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences under the Penal Code, the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (‘MACCA’) and the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities
Act 2001 (‘the seven charges’). The seven charges were registered under three
different suits on two different dates. The first four charges were filed on
4 July 2018 while the three remaining charges were filed on 8 August 2018.
On both dates, the charges were initially filed at the Sessions Court before
they were transferred to the High Court, pursuant to the certificates issued
by the Public Prosecutor (‘PP’) under s. 418A of the Criminal Procedure
Code (‘CPC’) and s. 60 of the MACCA. In the present application, the



356

[2019] 5 CLJ

Attorney General (‘AG’) sought to withdraw the above-mentioned transfer
certificates on the grounds that (i) the abundance of caution in order to avoid
any possible constitutional argument that the transfer effected by the AG,
under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA, was a nullity in view
of the recent decisions of the Federal Court in Semenyih Jaya Sdn Bhd
v. Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Hulu Langat (‘Semenyih Jaya’) and Indira Gandhi
Mutho v. Pengarah Jabatan Agama Islam Perak (‘Indira Gandhi’); (ii) upon the
withdrawal, the seven charges would revert to the Sessions Court, where they
originated from, and the prosecution would seek to have the charges
mentioned at the Sessions Court and immediately apply under s. 417 of the
CPC to have them transferred to this High Court; (iii) this High Court acted
suo motu (on its own motion) under s. 417(2) of the CPC to order the transfer
of the seven charges from the Sessions Court to this High Court; and (iv) these
procedural steps were necessary to prevent any unwarranted postponement
of the trial. Resisting the application, the accused argued that (i) the
withdrawal would result in a fatal defect which could potentially vitiate and
nullify the entire proceeding; (ii) the withdrawal would mean that the
proceedings ceased to exist and there was nothing for this High Court to order
to transfer and if the validity of s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA
was doubtful, so would the act of withdrawing the certificates;
(iii) the whole process of a mention at the Sessions Court and a fresh
registration at the High Court Registry to determine the High Court to try the
seven charges must be followed; and (iv) the defence reserved the right to
object should the seven charges eventually be registered at the same High
Court since they should be considered as a new case that would warrant a
High Court Judge who would not have adjudicated on the matter previously.

A

Held (allowing application):

F

(1) The court would answer the first question with a resounding ‘yes’. It is
not denied that s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA do not
specify the power of withdrawal. However, the PP is conferred with
wide powers, under art. 145(3) of the Federal Constitution (‘FC’), ‘…
to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence …’.
Furthermore, the PP shall have control and direction of all criminal
proceedings under ss. 376(1) of the CPC while under s. 254 of the CPC,
the PP may discontinue proceedings at any stage of the trial. If the PP
could decide to discontinue an actual prosecution, there is no legitimate
basis to deny that he has a similar authority to withdraw the certificates
under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA. (paras 18, 21, 23
& 24)
(2) Article 145 of the FC gives rise to two important observations. First, it
could not be denied that s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA
are well-supported by the express provision of art. 145(3A) of the FC.
However, the PP is, at the same time, entitled to take the view that the
constitutionality of s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA may

still be challenged. Secondly, art. 145(3A) of the FC clearly reinforces
the existence of the wide powers at the disposal of the PP in deciding
on the venue and the court in respect of any criminal prosecution. By
necessary implication, this overarching remit of the PP’s constitutional
authority must include the ability to withdraw the issuance of any
transfer certificates. A decision to withdraw is also a form of
determination of which court any criminal proceedings should be
instituted or transferred to. In other words, a withdrawal of the transfer
certificates is also an exercise of the constitutional authority of the PP
within the contemplation of art. 145(3) of the FC. Therefore, in respect
of the seven charges, the PP is empowered to effect the withdrawal of
the transfer certificates. (paras 25, 27-29 & 32)
(3) On the validity of the concerns expressed by the PP on the risk of s.
418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA, no view could be held as
constitutional in light of developments in constitutional law in Malaysia
post Semenyih Jaya and Indira Gandhi. There was no judicial
determination that these statutory provisions were unconstitutional by
reason of Semenyih Jaya and Indira Gandhi. It could not be fairly
suggested that the proposed change to the transfer status was being
intently pursued by the PP other than in good faith. The wide powers
on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, including in respect of the
right to direct the venue or court for prosecution, and particularly mere
withdrawal of the transfer certificates issued, would not cause
ramifications which the accused implied to be serious and setting an
unhealthy precedent to the administration of the courts. (paras 32-35)
(4) Under s. 418B of the CPC and s. 60(5) of the MACCA, the certificate
for transfer under both s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA
could only be validly issued by the PP in cases where the accused has
not pleaded guilty and where no evidence against the accused has been
adduced. The trial for the three suits containing the seven charges had
not commenced when the transfer certificates were issued. Neither had
the trial started when the PP now applied to have the same certificates
withdrawn. (paras 36-36)
(5) The power of the High Court to transfer cases is encapsulated in s. 417
of the CPC. There are three key aspects to the application of this
provision, namely (i) the parties who could make the application for the
transfer, as stated in s. 417(2) (‘the first aspect’); (ii) the basis for the
transfer, as specified in sub-s. 1(a) to (e) (‘the second aspect’); and
(iii) the type or order to be made, as set out in sub-s. (1)(aa) to (cc)
(‘the third aspect’). (para 38)
(6) On the first aspect, it is clear that the power to transfer under s. 417 of
the CPC is vested in the High Court. In all cases, the transfer order could
only be made by the High Court if it is satisfied that the basis for a
transfer has been established. Significantly, the language of s. 417(2) of



358

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

the CPC is devoid of any measure of ambiguity. It expressly and
specifically confers on the High Court the power to order a transfer,
even on its own initiative, without an application made by either the
accused or the prosecution. On the second aspect, the seven charges
should continue to be tried by this High Court as it would be expedient
for the ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC. On the third aspect,
the court invoked s. 417(1)(cc) where the order of transfer is for the
seven charges to be transferred from the Sessions Court to this High
Court. Any assertion that the transfer of the seven charges, from the
Sessions Court back to a particular and in fact, the same High Court,
which made the same transfer order, to be unlawfully, illegal or
irregular, was wholly unjustified and without merit. (paras 40, 41, 44,
52 & 71)
(7) The contention of the defence that when the certificates were
withdrawn, there were no proceedings or matter for this High Court to
exercise its jurisdiction to transfer, was flawed. The charges remained
in existence and were residing at the Sessions Court, it being an
automatic consequence of the withdrawal of the certificates. The fact
that the case, or the charges, were registered at the High Court did not
mean that the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear a transfer
application or make a transfer order. Obviously, only upon an order for
transfer is made by the High Court would the cases be transferred for
registration at the High Court. There was absolutely no basis to contend
that the withdrawal of the certificates would destroy entirely the
proceedings at the High Court, even going back to since the point of time
when they were first transferred. Therefore, the withdrawal of the
transfer certificates, under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACCA,
was effective only prospectively and had no effect on the proceedings on
the seven charges since 4 July 2018, before the withdrawal, which
remained valid. (paras 75-77, 81 & 84)
(8) The scenario painted by the accused was unwarranted. It was absolutely
irrelevant and out of context for the defence to premise its various
contentions on the nullity/constitutionality argument. The AG did not
submit that s. 418A of the CPC or s. 60 of the MACCA to be
unconstitutional. Emphasis was made on the need to act purely out of
an abundance of caution. Neither was the issue of the constitutionality
of s. 418A of the CPC or s. 60 of the MACCA before this court. The
prosecution merely wanted the risk of challenge, given the latest
developments in constitutional law in the country, be removed and the
start and progress of this important trial of great public interest to not
be unnecessarily interrupted. (paras 88 & 89)

(9) In light of the information made known by the AG, this court exercised
its direction, on its own motion under s. 417(2) of the CPC, to invoke
s. 417(1), and order the transfer of the seven charges from the Sessions
Court back to this High Court in accordance with s. 417(1)(cc). The
seven charges are to continue from the point of the withdrawal, with the
proceedings prior to the withdrawal remaining valid. (paras 99 & 100)

Introduction

I

[1]
This is an oral application by the Attorney General, as the Public
Prosecutor to withdraw the certificates issued under s. 418A of the Criminal
Procedure Code (“the CPC”) and s. 60 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009 (“the MACC Act”) that were previously issued by the
Public Prosecutor to transfer to the High Court the charges against the
accused that had been first filed in the Sessions Court.
[2]
At the conclusion of the hearing, I allowed the application and
exercise my discretion under s. 417(2) of the CPC to order the transfer of the
charges back to this High Court. This judgment sets out the full reasons for
my decision.



360

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

Key Background Facts
[3]
The prosecution had preferred seven criminal charges against the
accused concerning offences under the Penal Code, the MACC Act and the
Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of
Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (“the AMLATFA”) which have been
registered under three different suits. For the purposes of this judgment it is
sufficient for the subject-matter to be referred to collectively as the seven
charges.
[4]
The seven charges were registered on two different dates, about one
month apart. Four charges for offences under the Penal Code and the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 were filed on 4 July
2018, and the remainder three charges, all for offences under the AMLATFA
were filed subsequently on 8 August 2018, when all seven charges were
ordered to be jointly tried. The accused pleaded not guilty to all the charges
and asked to be tried. On 10 August 2018, this court fixed the trial of the
seven charges to commence on 12 February 2019 and to continue until
29 March 2019.
[5]
On both dates of 4 July 2018 and 8 August 2018, the charges had been
initially filed at the Sessions Court; but these were immediately transferred
on the same respective dates to the High Court pursuant to the certificates
issued by the Public Prosecutor under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the
MACC Act.
[6]
By a letter dated 14 January 2019 the prosecution, led by solicitor
general III, informed the court that it wished to make amendments to some
of the existing seven charges. In another letter of 23 January 2019, the
prosecution notified that it intended to prefer additional charges against the
accused. On 28 January 2019, this court allowed the amendments which
were not objected to by the defence. Three new additional charges under
AMLATFA were also read out to the accused who pleaded not guilty and
asked to be tried.
[7]
When the prosecution asked for these three new charges to be jointly
tried with the existing seven, counsel for the accused asked this court to allow
the defence a few days to consider whether or not the defence had any
objection to the joinder. I allowed the request, and fixed 7 February 2019,
just after Chinese New Year holidays, to hear submissions of parties should
there be any objection to the proposed joint trial.
[8]
On 7 February 2019, the Attorney General, leading the prosecution
however informed the court that a ruling on the issue of joinder would not
be necessary as he was proposing not to proceed on the three new charges
and asked for an order that the accused be granted a discharge not amounting
to an acquittal on these three charges, since the prosecution would file these
charges before the Sessions Court instead. The defence did not object. I then
ordered the DNAA of the accused on these three new charges.

A

[9]
The Attorney General then raised another matter which immediately
became contentious. The Attorney General wished to withdraw the transfer
certificates that had been previously issued under s. 418A of the CPC and
s. 60 of the MACC Act to transfer the seven charges to the High Court on
4 July 2018 and 8 August 2018.

B

[10] In essence, the withdrawal was stated by the Attorney General to be
done out of abundance of caution in order to avoid any possible
constitutional argument that the transfer effected by the Attorney General
under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act is a nullity in view
of the recent decisions of the Federal Court in Semenyih Jaya Sdn Bhd
v. Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Hulu Langat & Another Case [2017] 5 CLJ 526 and
Indira Gandhi Mutho v. Pengarah Jabatan Agama Islam Perak & Ors And Other
Appeals [2018] 3 CLJ 145.

C

D

[11] The Attorney General apprised the court that upon the withdrawal,
the cases on the seven charges would revert to the Sessions Court where they
originated. The prosecution would seek to have the charges mentioned at the
Sessions Court and then immediately apply under s. 417 to have them
transferred back to this High Court.

E

[12] Alternatively, the Attorney General suggested that this High Court act
suo motu (Latin for on its own motion) under s. 417(2) of the CPC to order
the transfer of the seven charges from the Sessions Court back to this High
Court.

F

[13] The Attorney General highlighted that these procedural steps would
be necessary to prevent any unwarranted postponement of the trial. This is
especially since that there has been compliance with s. 51A of the CPC,
26 witness statements had been supplied to the defence, and subpoenas had
all been served on the witnesses in preparation for trial that was to commence
on 12 February 2019.
The Objection By The Defence

G

H

I

[14] At the hearing, the defence argued more on the consequences of the
withdrawal in that the move by the Attorney General would result in a fatal
defect that could potentially vitiate and nullify the entire proceedings. In
particular it was submitted that the withdrawal means that the proceedings
ceased to exist and there was therefore nothing for this High Court to order
to transfer. If the validity of s. 418A and s. 60 is doubtful, so would the act
of withdrawing the certificates.
[15] Further, it was contended that even the status of the proceedings,
including the concluded hearings on the applications for the gag order, the
appointment letter of the prosecutor and the request for discovery of
documents, and indeed the entire proceedings since the transfer to the High
Court, all of which proceeded at the High Court on the basis of the previous
certificates, could all now be at risk of being vitiated.



Current Law Journal

362

[2019] 5 CLJ

[16] The lead counsel pointed out that once withdrawn, the whole process
of a mention at the Sessions Court and a fresh registration at the High Court
Registry to determine the High Court to try the seven charges must be
followed. The defence would also reserve the right to object should the seven
charges eventually be registered in the same High Court since these should
be considered as a new case that would warrant a High Court Judge who
would not have adjudicated on the matter previously.

A

B

Evaluation And Findings Of This Court
[17] The matter on the withdrawal of the transfer certificates, as I
mentioned earlier, was raised by the prosecution only on 7 February 2019
itself, without prior notice. The prosecution and the defence submitted orally
on the points of contention as I have outlined earlier. There were no written
submissions. The lead counsel for the defence did suggest that the court allow
more time for parties to research on the matter and to submit on another day.
After having considered oral arguments, I chose to decide on the matter, for
the reasons that will now follow.

C

D

The Power Of The AG To Withdraw
[18] The first issue of importance is whether the Public Prosecutor has the
power to withdraw the transfer certificates which he had personally as the
Public Prosecutor previously issued in respect of the seven charges. I would
readily answer this question with a resounding ‘Yes’. It is not denied that the
two statutory provisions do not specify the power of withdrawal.
[19]

E

Section 418A of the CPC reads as follows:

418A. Trials by High Court on a certificate by the Public Prosecutor
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 417 and subject to section
418B, the Public Prosecutor may in any particular case triable by a
criminal Court subordinate to the High Court issue a certificate
specifying the High Court in which the proceedings are to be
instituted or transferred and requiring that the accused person be
caused to appear or be produced before such High Court.

F

G

(2) The power of the Public Prosecutor under subsection (1) shall be
exercised by him personally.
(3) The certificate of the Public Prosecutor issued under subsection (1)
shall be tendered to the subordinate Court before which the case
is triable whereupon the Court shall transfer the case to the High
Court specified in the certificate and cause the accused person to
appear or be brought before such Court as soon as may be
practicable.
(4) When the accused person appears or is brought before the High
Court in accordance with subsection (3), the High Court shall fix a
date for his trial which shall be held in accordance with the
procedure under Chapter XX.

[2019] 5 CLJ
A

[20]

PP v. Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak

363

Section 60 of the MACC Act similarly provides as follows:

60. Trial by High Court on a certificate by the Public Prosecutor

B

(1) Notwithstanding the provision of section 417 of the Criminal
Procedure Code and subject to subsection (5), the Public Prosecutor
may in any particular case triable in the Sessions Court for an
offence under this Act, issue a certificate specifying the High Court
in which the proceedings are to be instituted or transferred and
requiring that the accused person be caused to appear or be
produced before such High Court.

C

(2) The power of the Public Prosecutor under subsection (1) shall be
exercised by him personally.

D

(3) The certificate of the Public Prosecutor issued under subsection (1)
shall be tendered to the sessions court whereupon the sessions
court shall transfer the case to the High Court specified in the
certificate and cause the accused person to appear or be brought
before such court as soon as may be practicable.
(4) When the accused person appears or is brought before the High
Court in accordance with subsection (3), the High Court shall fix a
date for his trial which shall be held in accordance with the
procedure under Chapter XX of the Criminal Procedure Code.

E

F

(5) This section shall apply to all cases before the Sessions Court to try
offences under this Act, whether the proceedings are instituted
before or after the coming into operation of this Act, provided that
the accused person has not pleaded guilty and no evidence in
respect of the case against him has begun to be adduced.

[21] However, it is equally clear that if the Public Prosecutor could decide
to discontinue an actual prosecution, there is no legitimate basis to deny that
he has a similar authority to withdraw the s. 418A/s. 60 certificate.

G

[22] In fact, this position was perhaps not surprisingly not seriously
challenged by the accused at the hearing, where counsel submitted more on
the arguments on the risk, consequential to the withdrawal, of the entire
proceedings especially the claim that the trial, if held, would be defective and
could be nullified.

H

[23] Although not specifically highlighted at the hearing because it is trite,
I am not unmindful of the well-entrenched position in our constitutional law
of the wide powers conferred on the Public Prosecutor by art. 145(3) of the
Federal Constitution which reads:
(3) The Attorney General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion,
to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence, other
than proceedings before a Syariah court, a native court or a court-martial.

I

[24] Further it is no less settled that the Public Prosecutor shall have
control and direction of all criminal proceedings under the CPC pursuant to
s. 376(1). And under s. 254 of the CPC, the Public Prosecutor may
discontinue proceedings at any stage of the trial.



364

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[25] In contrast, in the instant case the Public Prosecutor is only asking for
the withdrawal, not of the proceedings, but merely of the certificates of
transfer.
[26] Article 145(3A) of the Federal Constitution makes the position crystal
clear. Thus:

A

B

(3A) Federal law may confer on the Attorney General power to determine
the courts in which or the venue at which any proceedings which he has
power under Clause (3) to institute shall be instituted or to which such
proceedings shall be transferred.

[27] For present purposes, the provisions of art. 145 as set out above give
rise to two important observations. First, it cannot be denied that s. 418A
of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act are well-supported by the express
provision of art. 145(3A). However the Public Prosecutor is at the same time
entitled to take the view that the constitutionality of s. 418A of the CPC and
s. 60 of the MACC Act may still be challenged.
[28] Secondly, art. 145(3A) clearly reinforces the existence of the wide
powers at the disposal of the Public Prosecutor in deciding on the venue and
the court in respect of any criminal prosecution. By necessary implication,
surely, this overarching remit of the Public Prosecutor’s constitutional
authority must include the ability to withdraw the issuance of any transfer
certificates.
[29] A decision to withdraw is also a form of a determination of which
court any criminal proceedings should be instituted or transferred to. In other
words, a withdrawal of the transfer certificates is also an exercise of the
constitutional authority of the Public Prosecutor within the contemplation of
art. 145(3A) of the Federal Constitution.

C

D

E

F

[30] After all, s. 40(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 further
provide:
(1) Where a written law confers a power on any person to do or enforce
the doing of any act or thing, all such powers shall be understood to be
also given as are reasonably necessary to enable the person to do or
enforce the doing of the act or thing.

[31] As such, s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act should also
be read to include the authority of the Public Prosecutor to withdraw the
certificates previously issued.
[32] In respect of the existing seven charges, in my view the Public
Prosecutor is thus empowered to effect the withdrawal of the transfer
certificates. I profess for present purposes no view on the validity of the
concerns expressed by the Public Prosecutor on the risk of s. 418A of the
CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act be held as unconstitutional in light of
developments in constitutional law in this country post Semenyih Jaya and
Indira Gandhi.

A

[33] There is of course no judicial determination that these statutory
provisions are unconstitutional by reason of Semenyih Jaya and Indira
Gandhi. And I do not think it could be fairly suggested that the proposed
change to the transfer status is being intently pursued by the Public
Prosecutor other than in good faith.

B

[34] I do not think that this wide powers on the exercise of prosecutorial
discretion, including in respect of the right to direct the venue or court for
prosecution, and particularly merely of withdrawing the certificates
previously issued would cause ramifications which the lead counsel for the
accused implied to be serious and setting an unhealthy precedent to the
administration of the courts.

C

D

E

[35] For it is important to note that under s. 418B of the CPC and s. 60(5)
of the MACC Act, the certificate for transfer under both s. 418A and s. 60
can only validly be issued by the Public Prosecutor in cases where the
accused has not pleaded guilty and where no evidence against the accused has
been adduced (incidentally there is no such limitation for a transfer under
s. 417, as made plain in sub-s. (4)).
[36] In other words, in respect of the latter, the trial has not commenced
with any witness testimony. This is exactly the situation in the instant
proceeding before me. The trial for the three suits containing the seven
charges have not commenced when the s. 418A and the s. 60 transfer
certificates were issued. Neither, crucially for present purposes, has the trial
started when the Public Prosecutor now applies to have the same certificates
withdrawn.

F

[37] The fears that the Public Prosecutor having the power to effect
withdrawals of the transfer certificates would potentially unjustifiably lead to
interruption or in any fashion interfere with the trial proceedings in the High
Court, thus undermining the administration of justice is therefore entirely
misconceived.

G

Exercise Of Discretion Under S. 417(2) Of The CPC On The Own Initiative Of The
High Court

H

I

[38] The power of the High Court to transfer cases is encapsulated in s. 417
of the CPC. There are, for present purposes, three key aspects to the
application of this provision. The first is the parties who could make the
application for the transfer, as stated in s. 417(2). The second is the basis for
the transfer, which is specified in sub-s. (1)(a) to (e). The third is the type of
order to be made, as set out in sub-s. (1)(aa) to (cc).
[39] For clarity, it is apposite that s. 417 of the CPC be stated in full, as
follows:
417. High Court’s power to transfer cases
(1) Whenever it is made to appear to the High Court:



Current Law Journal

366

[2019] 5 CLJ

(a) that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in any criminal Court
subordinate to it;

A

(b) that some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise;
(c) that a view of the place in or near which any offence has been
committed may be required for the satisfactory trial of the same;
B

(d) that an order under this section will tend to the general
convenience of the parties or witnesses; or
(e) that such an order is expedient for the ends of justice, or is
required by any provision of this Code,
it may order:

C

(aa) that any offence be tried by any Court not empowered under
sections 121 to 126 but in other respects competent to try such
offence;
(bb) that any particular case or class of cases be transferred from a
criminal Court subordinate to it to any other such criminal
Court of equal or superior jurisdiction; or

D

(cc) that any particular criminal case be transferred to and tried
before the High Court.
(2) The High Court may make an order under subsection (1) either on
the report of the lower Court, or on the application of the Public
Prosecutor or the accused person, or on its own initiative.
(3) (a) When an order is made under paragraph (1)(cc) the lower Court
before which the trial of the offence against the accused person is
pending shall cause the accused person to appear or be brought
before the High Court on the date specified in the said order or as
soon as may be practicable if no such date is specified.
(b) When the accused person appears or is brought before the High
Court in accordance with paragraph (a), it shall fix a date for his trial
which shall be held in accordance with the procedure under Chapter
XX.

E

F

G

(4) The Court to which a case is transferred under this section may act
on the evidence already recorded in a trial or partly so recorded and
partly recorded by itself, or it may re-summon the witnesses and recommence the trial:
Provided that in any case so transferred the Public Prosecutor
or the accused person may, when the Court to which the case
is transferred commences its proceedings, apply that the
witnesses or any of them be re-summoned and re-heard.

[40] On the first aspect concerning the party making the application for
transfer, it is clear that the power to transfer under s. 417 of the CPC is vested
in the High Court. In all cases, the transfer order can only be made by the
High Court, if it is satisfied that the basis for a transfer has been established.

C

PP v. Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak

367

And significantly, the language of s. 417(2) is devoid of any measure of
ambiguity. It expressly and specifically confers on the High Court the power
to order a transfer even on its own initiative, without an application be made
by either the accused or the prosecution.
[41] The question would be under what circumstances should this power
by the court to order a transfer on its own initiative be exercised? In my
view, exceptionally. For in the great majority of cases the application to
transfer would be initiated by the accused or by the prosecution. It would
not be common to expect the High Court to initiate a transfer.
[42] But it is manifest that the law in the CPC confers on the High Court
the power to order a transfer under s. 417(1) on the basis of its own motion
or initiative. This is not so unlike the revisionary powers of the High Court
under the CPC and especially the Courts of Judicature Act 1964, where the
High Court may act on its own motion and call for the record of proceedings
in the subordinate courts.

D

E

[43] In the instant case before me the matter on the need by the Public
Prosecutor to withdraw the certificates on the abundance of caution was
brought to my attention by the Public Prosecutor in the instant proceeding.
There is therefore no necessity for me to call for any record of background
reference on the matter in view of the fact that the seven charges had been
transferred to this very court by early August of last year. This was how this
High Court got notice of the matter that called for the exercise of its
discretion to initiate a transfer on its own motion under s. 417(2).
The Basis For The Transfer

F

G

H

I

[44] On the second aspect concerning whether the basis for a transfer has
been made out, in my view, the seven charges should continue to be tried
by this High Court on the basis that it would be expedient for the ends of
justice under s. 417(1)(e) given the following considerations.
[45] First, the seven charges were registered on 4 July 2018 and 8 August
2018 and since then this High Court has heard three contested applications
in the course of the following months, all of which are pending appeal. A
number of case management sessions has taken place, and various issues had
been raised by parties with a view to their preparation for trial which had
been fixed to begin on 12 February 2019. In other words, this High Court
had already been assigned to try this case and is the only one with a
substantive history vis-à-vis the seven charges.
[46] Secondly, charges in other prosecution against the accused have been
transferred to the High Court under the same s. 417(1)(e) on the application
of the accused himself. To be clear, I do not think a transfer to the High Court
per se is objectionable to the accused in the instant case either.



368

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[47] Thirdly, this case has also generated much public interest locally as
well as internationally.

A

[48] Fourthly, the issuance of the s. 418A and s. 60 certificates were never
objected to by the accused when the accused was first charged.
[49] Fifthly, and this is especially crucial, there is no prejudice or injustice
caused to the defence of the accused. In essence and substance, there are no
changes to this proceeding at all, other than merely on the basis of the transfer
of the case (for example, either s. 417 or s. 418A).
[50] Sixthly, parties should already be ready for the commencement of trial
which ought to have begun less than one week after the instant proceeding.
The prosecution has complied with s. 51A on the delivery of documents they
intend to tender, all applications have been heard, and date of the trial to start
on 12 February 2019 was fixed some seven months ago.
[51] As such, given the above considerations, which I consider to be more
than satisfy the requirement of being “expedient for the ends of justice” under
s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC, a transfer to the High Court would be more than
justified. It is also because of these same considerations which I find
especially and exceptionally compelling that I decided to exercise my
discretion on my own initiative in accordance with s. 417(2) to order the
transfer of the seven charges as registered under the three cases from the
Sessions Court (given the withdrawal of the s. 418A/s. 60 certificates and the
reversion of the seven charges to the Sessions Court) back to this High Court
under s. 417(1)(cc).

B

C

D

E

Transfer To The High Court, And To A Specific High Court
F

[52] The third aspect of the application of s. 417 is in relation to the order
to be made. In this case, as mentioned, I invoked s. 417(1)(cc) where the
order of transfer is for the seven charges to be transferred from the Sessions
Court to this High Court. Section 417(1)(cc) of course plainly states that the
order can be on any particular criminal case to be transferred to and tried
before the High Court. My order is for the transfer to the High Court. It
therefore falls within limb (cc) of s. 417(1).
[53] Not unexpectedly, the defence argued at the hearing in resisting the
withdrawal of the transfer certificates by the Public Prosecutor that upon the
reversion of the seven charges to the Sessions Court, any subsequent transfer
process back to the High Court cannot be specifically directed to a particular
High Court.
[54] This is because, according to the lead counsel, that any new matter for
distribution to the High Court in Kuala Lumpur must be done pursuant to
the registration system of the High Court Registry of the relevant divisions
in Kuala Lumpur. In other words, it would not be legitimate for me to order

the transfer of the seven charges back to the same High Court without going
through the registration system since the seven charges could be registered
in any one of the four High Courts in the Criminal Division in Kuala
Lumpur.
[55] There is some merit in that argument, in a more general context. But
in the instant case, I would consider it unsustainable. I say so for a number
of reasons. First, limb (cc) of s. 417(1) of the CPC contains no such
restriction. Secondly, whilst it is true that it would not ordinarily be
automatic that a High Court could order the transfer from a subordinate court
to any particular High Court that is due to the administrative process of
registration. There are otherwise no stipulations one way or the other in the
CPC.
[56] I agree any application for transfers from the Sessions Court must
follow certain formalities. Any departure does not augur well for the due
administration of justice. Thus any application for transfer to the High Court,
if allowed by the High Court hearing that transfer application, must be
referred back to the Sessions Court where the charges were originally filed,
in order to have the transfer from the Sessions Court to the High Court
formalised.
[57] Upon the Sessions Court being apprised of the order of the transfer to
the High Court, the suit containing the charges will have to be registered at
the High Court Registry which registration system will determine the specific
High Court that will try the charges.
[58] However – and this is the crucial point – such a process would be
applicable for transfer applications made by the prosecution or the accused
under s. 417(2). It is not automatically applicable to situations like the
present where the transfer is moved by the initiative of the High Court itself
under the same s. 417(2). When the High Court decides to exercise its
discretion to invoke s. 417(2) it is unnecessary that the formalities of going
through the registration routing system be followed, provided that the
requirements
of
s. 417 is adhered to, particularly the ground for the transfer as stated under
s. 417(1)(a) to (e), bearing in mind that the court would exercise this power
on its own motion only exceptionally.
[59] And this has everything to do with the reasons why the discretion is
exercised to order a transfer in the first place. As mentioned earlier, in most
cases an application by the prosecution or the accused would be sufficient.
But in certain exceptional circumstances it would not necessarily be. The
instant case is one such situation, for the compelling considerations I have
outlined earlier.
[60] Furthermore, in the instant case, if the seven charges which reverted
to the Sessions Court upon the withdrawal of the certificates be pursued by
the prosecution by way of an application by the prosecution for a transfer to



370

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

the High Court, the seven charges might end up in a different High Court.
This in my view does not accord with the ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e)
for the reasons I have earlier set out, as to why this High Court should
continue trying the seven charges.
[61] If I do not exercise my discretion, the seven charges could be
registered in any one of the other three High Court, and where new trial dates
would have to be fixed by the High Court Judge depending on the available
dates of that High Court, despite the original trial dates in February and
March 2019 having been fixed several months back in early August 2018.
Such state of affairs is plainly unsatisfactory and patently inconsistent with
the ends of justice considering the circumstances of the case.
[62] How can it be when the prosecution have already delivered the s. 51A
documents and certain witness statements to the accused, as well as issued
summons for witnesses to attend trial as scheduled? More so, crucially, when
no prejudice or injustice could be shown to have been occasioned to the
accused by this transfer order initiated by the High Court.

A

B

C

D

[63] Neither do the case law authorities stipulate that a transfer cannot be
done to a specific High Court. If anything, it is quite the reverse and weakens
the contention of the defence.
[64] In PP v. Lim Shui Wang & Ors [1979] 1 MLJ 65 which is an authority
where the High Court (on its own motion, like presently), invoked its powers
under s. 417(2) to order a transfer (from the High Court to the Special
Sessions Court), I can do no better than reproducing the passage from the
judgment of Suffian LP on behalf of the former Federal Court which was
expressed in trademark lucidity as follows:
From subsection (2) of section 417 it is clear that the High Court may
transfer a case on the report of the lower court or on the application of
the Attorney-General or, as happened here, on its own initiative; but this
is subject to two restrictions. First, the High Court may do so only for
the reasons stated in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (1) of section 417,
and secondly, the High Court may transfer a case only from a subordinate
court to another subordinate court or to itself, but not from itself to a
subordinate court.

[65] In that case the Federal Court held that the transfer of the cases from
the High Court to the Special Sessions Court was not proper in the
circumstances. In addition it was also decided that the power of a judge of
the High Court to transfer a case under s. 25(2) of the Courts of Judicature
Act 1964 and item 12 of its Schedule was subject to the discretion of the
Attorney-General under art. 145(3) of the Federal Constitution to choose the
forum in which persons charged under s. 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs
Ordinance were to be tried, and that the power conferred under art. 145(3)
on the Attorney-General would override the power of the High Court to
transfer so that the judge had no power to transfer on his own motion for trial
in a subordinate court.

C

PP v. Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak

371

[66] In contradistinction, in the instant case before me, the transfer
initiated by this High Court is to be made from the Sessions Court to the High
Court. This is clearly within the limits defined in PP v. Lim Shui Wang & Ors
as stated above.
[67] In fact as is manifest from the above passage attributed to Suffian LP,
in that case it was said that the High Court could not transfer cases to the
subordinate court, but may do so to itself. As such there is absolutely no legal
impediment to a transfer to a specific High Court. I do not think, considering
the context, it can be said that the Federal Court meant the High Court
generally and generically when using the expression “itself”.
[68] That is however not all. For there is also a Privy Council authority
in respect of an appeal from Malaysia in the case of PP v. Fan Yew Teng [1973]
2 MLJ 1 where Lord Salmon ruled that where an order for transfer is made
under s. 417 of the CPC, it is not necessary that the case be tried by the judge
who made the order of transfer. His Lordship stated thus:

D

E

F

Their Lordships agree with the Federal Court that “there is neither rhyme
nor reason in holding that the same judge must try the case once he has
made the order of transfer”. Indeed, so to hold would lead to
unnecessary difficulties should the judge who ordered the transfer be
incapacitated, retired or dead when the case came on for trial. Their
Lordships entirely agree with the Federal Court in rejecting the
respondent’s second point.

[69] This Privy Council decision therefore envisaged that the case being
transferred may be tried by the judge who made the transfer order, like what
I have done by invoking s. 417(2) read with s. 417(1)(e), but made it explicit
that it would not be necessary that it should be so.
[70] In that case, the applicant for transfer was the accused himself. In the
instant case before me, the court moved for the transfer to itself for the
reasons which, as I have stated, would be more than expedient for the ends
of justice under s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC.

G

[71] As such, in my view, any assertion that the transfer of the
seven charges from the Sessions Court back to a particular and in fact the
same High Court (which made the transfer order) to be unlawful, illegal or
in any manner irregular is wholly unjustified and without merit.
H

I

The Status Of The Seven Charges Upon Withdrawal Of The Transfer Certificates
[72] Counsel for the accused argued that upon the withdrawal of the
s. 418A/s. 60 certificates, the seven charges would automatically revert to
the Sessions Court where they had been originally registered. This much I
agree. But I do not share the view of learned counsel for the accused that it
follows therefore that the High Court ceases to have any further jurisdiction
or authority whatsoever on the subject of the seven charges to enable any
transfer orders to be made.



372

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[73] For clarity I should emphasise that the effect of the withdrawal of the
certificates, from the point of withdrawal (date of this order) is for the seven
charges to revert to the Sessions Court where they had been originally filed
and registered. When that happens, the seven charges cease to be registered
with the High Court Registry.

A

[74] In the instant case, since the background of the matter had been
notified to me sitting as a High Court Judge in the instant proceeding, upon
the withdrawal, and on the own initiative of this court, I exercised my
discretion under s. 417(2) of the CPC on the basis of s. 417(1)(e) to order the
transfer of the seven charges (already reverted to the Sessions Court) back to
the same High Court, for the reasons I have stated earlier.

B

[75] The contention of the defence that when the certificates are
withdrawn, there is no proceedings or matter for this High Court to exercise
its jurisdiction to transfer in the first place is therefore flawed, because the
charges remain in existence and are residing at the Sessions Court, it being
an automatic consequence of the withdrawal of the certificates.
[76] When the High Court considers whether or not to transfer a case from
the Sessions Court to the High Court under s. 417, the case is still registered
at the Sessions Court. This is the situation in all applications made by either
the accused or the prosecution, and that is also the position in the instant
case.
[77] The fact that the case or the charges are registered at the Sessions Court
and not registered at the High Court cannot mean that the High Court has no
jurisdiction to hear a transfer application or make a transfer order. Obviously
only upon an order for transfer is made by the High Court, would the cases
be transferred for registration at the High Court.
[78] Moreover, the process of mentioning the withdrawal of the certificates
at the Sessions Court is merely administrative and does not affect the legal
consequence of the withdrawal which is the seven charges being
automatically reverted to the Sessions Court.
[79] Importantly, the fact that these seven charges are at the Sessions Court
does not and cannot bar the High Court from exercising its transfer powers
in accordance with s. 417 of the CPC. At the risk of repetition, the seven
charges were originally transferred to the High Court purely by reason of the
certificate. Given its withdrawal, the seven charges revert to the Sessions
Court.

C

D

E

F

G

H

[80] I must emphasise the crucial fact that these seven charges have not
been withdrawn.
[81] There is accordingly absolutely no basis to contend that the
withdrawal of the certificates would destroy entirely the proceedings at the
High Court, even going back to since the point of time they were first
transferred. No authorities were cited in support. None exists since that
cannot be the legal consequence of the withdrawal.

B

C

PP v. Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak

[82] Plain common sense and logic which would readily accord with the
ends of justice would also dictate that there is no rhyme or reason to
unnecessarily hold that the proceedings at the High Court preceding the
withdrawal to be a potential nullity.
[83] After all, the proceedings at the High Court during the subsistence of
the certificates prior to its withdrawal owed its very existence to the
certificates. Thus, the withdrawal should not affect the entire period of
proceeding prior to its ceasing to have effect.
[84] In my judgment, the withdrawal of the s. 418A and s. 60 certificates
is therefore effective only prospectively and has no effect on the proceedings
on the seven charges since 4 July 2018 before the withdrawal which remain
valid.
Risk Of Entire Proceedings Being Vitiated

D

E

F

G

H

I

[85] The defence made much of the risk of the entire proceedings be
nullified by reason of the withdrawal of the certificate. I do not see how that
can be the consequence of the withdrawal. First, the AG has the authority
to withdraw the certificates which this court permits. There cannot be any
argument that the withdrawal before the court amounts to an interference
with judicial powers of the courts.
[86] Withdrawal of certificates is within the ambit of art. 145(3A) and like
withdrawal of charges being authorised under art. 145(3), they cannot be
construed as being unconstitutional or in any manner potentially a nullity.
Such a premise is untenable.
[87] A key thrust of the argument of the accused is that precisely given the
doubts expressed by the prosecution on the validity of s. 418A and s. 60 that
the Attorney General similarly cannot validly purport to exercise his power
to withdraw the certificates. If it is a nullity then everything about it is a
nullity. If the Attorney General considers reliance on the transfer certificates
to be an issue, the withdrawal would also be an issue and the entire
proceedings of this case at this High Court since 4 July 2018 which have
taken place because of the transfer certificates would also be in doubt. It was
even suggested that the easiest way out would be to withdraw the charges and
start all over again.
[88] I think this scenario painted by the accused is unwarranted. The
Attorney General did not submit that s. 418A of the CPC or s. 60 of the
MACC Act to be unconstitutional. Emphasis was made on the need to act
purely out of an abundance of caution. Neither is the issue of the
constitutionality of s. 418A/s. 60 before this court. It is therefore absolutely
irrelevant and out of context for the defence to premise its various
contentions on the nullity/constitutionality argument.



374

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[89] The prosecution merely wanted the risk of challenge given the latest
developments in constitutional law in the country be removed and the start
and progress of this important trial of great public interest not be
unnecessarily interrupted. And there is, as I said earlier, in any event no
judicial determination to the effect that these provisions are unconstitutional.
The law is that s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act are valid.

[90] Secondly if it were defective, and the withdrawal set aside on appeal,
there will be no change whatsoever to the trial proceedings. It would mean
the trial should continue on the basis of the certificate being fully intact and
effective.
[91] But even with the withdrawal, the trial would still have proceeded, for
all intents and purposes, on the same basis. There would be absolutely no
difference. The only distinction is the technical issue that the case is at the
High Court on account of say, s. 417 instead of s. 418A.
[92] In any event, if the objection by the defence to the withdrawal is
sustained, it means there is no withdrawal. That could also mean that the
certificates would still be effective. And the issue of reversion of the seven
charges to the Sessions Court and the subsequent transfer to the High Court
would not arise. In the absence of any withdrawal, the case should therefore
proceed as per normal. And this would be absolutely no different from how
the case is being progressed by my invoking s. 417(2) on the basis of
s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC.
[93] However, I accept that if the entire s. 418A/s. 60, including
art. 145(3A) are declared unconstitutional, that would be a different matter
altogether. But that is not the position of the Attorney General. And in any
case, as I have said, that is not the law that binds us all today.
[94] Thirdly, given all that, what injustice or prejudice can remotely be
said to have been caused to the accused? It cannot be attributed to the risk
of the trial be ruled a nullity and that a re-trial may be ordered, because that
would be a circular argument.

[95] Fourthly, the risk of nullity would in any event be a disproportionate
outcome to what is argued as, essentially, a technical issue. Even if the
withdrawal or the transfer were to be struck down, the entire proceedings
would not necessarily be held to be vitiated or null and void.
H

[96] For example, the principle of prospective overruling could be adopted
instead so as not to give retrospective effect to the proceedings of withdrawal
and transfer which had taken place prior to the date of appellate judgment
and would remain undisturbed and not be affected.

[97] That was the exact essence of the majority decision of the Supreme
Court in PP v. Dato’ Yap Peng [1987] 1 LNS 28; [1987] 2 MLJ 311 where
the very s. 418A of the CPC was declared unconstitutional for infringing
art. 121(1) of the Federal Constitution (this was before the enactment of
art. 145(3A), referred to above). And even if for argument sake the
contention of defence were correct, this principle could be readily applied
given the circumstances of the instant case.
Conclusion

[98] In view of the foregoing reasons it is my judgment that the Attorney
General, as the Public Prosecutor is under the law fully empowered at this
stage of the proceedings on the seven charges, to withdraw the transfer
certificates previously issued under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the
MACC Act.
[99] Given the withdrawal of the transfer certificates and following the
reversion of the seven charges to the Sessions Court where they had been
originally registered, and on the basis of the considerations that I have stated
to be more than fully justified as being expedient in the ends of justice under
s. 417(1)(e) (with readiness for imminent trial since the first charges of July
2018, absence of prejudice to the accused, and involvement of this court in
the adjudication of matters relevant to the seven charges being amongst the
overriding reasons), I decided, in light of the information made known to this
court by the Attorney General, to exercise the discretion of this High Court,
on its own motion under s. 417(2), to invoke s. 417(1) and order the transfer
of the seven charges from the Sessions Court back to this High Court in
accordance with s. 417(1)(cc), as permitted by case law authorities.

F

[100] The same seven charges are transferred back to the same High Court,
and to continue from the point of the withdrawal, with the proceedings prior
to the withdrawal remaining valid.
