During an operation in Malaysian waters, the team from The Malaysian
Maritime Enforcement Agency, headed by Liutenant Mohd Zahir (‘PW3’),
had stopped a vessel known as ‘One United 15’ (‘the vessel’) and carried out
an inspection on the same. They met the respondent and when asked to
produce the relevant documents for the vessel and the crew, the respondent
handed over a file containing, inter alia, RM1,500. As PW3 was checking the
notes, the respondent kept nodding his head. On the same day, when PW3
and one Laskar Kanan Mohammad Takdir Ramadhani (‘PW4’) were with
the respondent in a room, the respondent pointed to a cabinet. PW4 checked
what was in the cabinet and discovered another RM1,500. Again, the
respondent responded by nodding his head. PW3 then lodged a report to the
police and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (‘MACC’) regarding
the incident and handed over the RM3,000 cash recovered from the
respondent to the MACC officer. The respondent was subsequently charged
at the Sessions Court under s. 17(b) of the Malaysia Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009 (‘the Act’) for two charges of corruptly giving
gratification to PW3 as an inducement for PW3 to forbear from taking legal
action against the respondent who allegedly committed an offence under
s. 8(a) of the Fisheries Act 1985 (‘the FA’) and s. 6(1)(c) of the Immigration

Act 1959/63 (‘the IA’). However, the respondent was discharged and
acquitted by the Sessions Court Judge, of both offences at the close of the
prosecution’s case, on the ground that a prima facie case was not established.
Hence, the present appeal by the prosecution. The issues that arose for the
court’s adjudication were (i) whether the two consents to prosecute, exhs. B
and C respectively, were proper and valid; (ii) whether prosecution proved
a prima facie case against the respondent, namely (a) whether a gratification
was offered, paid or given to or received by the receiver; (b) whether at the
time of the offer, payment, gift or receipt, the receiver was in the
employment of a public body; and (c) whether the gratification was paid or
given or offered corruptly as an inducement for doing an act in relation to
the affairs of that public body; and (iii) whether the presumption under
s. 50(1) of the Act could be invoked.
Held (affirming order of Sessions Court; discharging and acquitting
respondent):

(1) The particulars in the first charge and exh. B were almost the same
except that there was an insertion of ‘1pm’ in exh. B. The difference
between the second charge and exh. C was the position of the vessel. The
particulars sufficiently showed the prosecution’s intention to prefer the
two charges against the respondent as per the charges, respectively. Such
minor and immaterial differences in exhs. B and C were minor and
immaterial irregularities which did not occasion any miscarriage of
justice to the respondent. They were curable under s. 422 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. (paras 14, 15 & 17)
(2) To prove the charges under s. 17(b) of the Act against the respondent,
the prosecution must prove that (i) a gratification was offered, paid or
given to or received by the receiver (‘the first ingredient’); (ii) at the time
of the offer, payment, gift or receipt, the receiver was in the employment
of a public body (‘the second ingredient’); and (iii) the gratification was
paid or given or offers corruptly as an inducement for doing an act in
relation to the affairs of that public body (‘the third ingredient’). The
prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case against the respondent in
respect of the two charges. (paras 20 & 43)
(3) The prosecution contended that the respondent was nodding his head as
a signal for PW3 to take the total sum of RM3,000 as a bribe. However,
such non-verbal gesture was capable of a number of interpretations and
did not necessarily mean that the respondent was indicating to PW3 to
take the monies as bribes. Any favourable interpretation should be
drawn in favour of the respondent. The mere handing over of the file
containing, inter alia, RM1,500 accompanied with a nodding of the head
did not constitute an offering of a bribe to PW3. The RM1,500 could

have been kept inside the file for safe-keeping along with the other
documents. The prosecution failed to prove the first ingredient of the
offences preferred against the respondent. (paras 25, 26, 31 & 33)
(4) The second ingredient was not disputed and was proven by way of
testimonies and exhibits. Furthermore, the respondent never disputed
this issue. (para 34)
(5) The prosecution failed to show that the respondent had offered or given
the alleged bribe monies totalling to RM3,000, for not taking any action
against the respondent and his crew and vessel, for allegedly having
committed an offence under s. 8(a) of the FA and s. 6(1)(c) of the IA.
There was also no clear evidence to show that the respondent, his crew
and the vessel had breached any laws of Malaysia, in particular under
the FA or under the IA, as contended by PW3. In fact, the 21 crew
members had been released as they have not committed any offences.
There were no charges preferred against the respondent and this showed
that no offences were committed by the respondent. No gratification was
paid or given or offered corruptly as an inducement for doing an act in
relation to the affairs of that public body. (paras 36-39)
(6) Since the prosecution failed to prove that the respondent offered or paid
any bribes to PW3 and no gratification was paid or given or offered
corruptly as an inducement for doing an act in relation to the affairs of
that public body, the presumption under s. 50 of the Act was not
triggered. (para 42)

The Appellant/Prosecution’s Case

I

[3]
On 16 June 2017, Lt. Mohd Zahir bin Mohamad Basri (PW3) from
the Malaysia Maritime Enforcement Agency testified that he and his team
were carrying out an “Ops Permai 01/06” in Malaysian waters, together
with, inter alia, Laskar Kanan Mohammad Takdir Ramadhani (PW4).

[4]
At about 5.24am on 18 June 2017, PW3 and his team pursued a few
vessels which were suspected of being involved in illegal activities. After
about 30 minutes of chasing, PW3 and his team managed to stop one vessel
namely “One United 15”. PW3 together with PW4 aboard the said vessel
to carry out the inspection and met “the Tekong” who is the respondent
herein. When asked to produce the relevant documents for the vessel and his
crew, the respondent handed over one transparent file folder to PW3. In the
said file folder, PW3 saw some Malaysia banknotes kept inside together with
passports of the respondent, crew, licence and some other documents.
[5]
The appellant contended that the respondent kept nodding his head
when the PW3 examined the said file folder which PW3 construed as the
respondent offering a bribe to PW3, by asking him to take the money. PW3
then took the Malaysia banknotes, counted them and they amounted to
RM1,500 (all in RM100 notes). PW3 kept the money in the said file folder
which was with him all the time.
[6]
On the same day, at about 1pm, when PW3, PW4 and the respondent
were at the Tekong’s room, the respondent pointed to a cabinet behind him.
PW3 then instructed PW4 to check what was in the cabinet that was being
pointed out by the respondent. PW4 conducted a check and found out there
were some money (all in RM100 notes) kept in the cabinet. PW4 then took
out the money and showed it to PW3.
[7]
The respondent then responded by nodding his head, purportedly
signaling to PW3, to take the said money but PW3 refused and warned him.
The respondent kept on giving the same head signal to PW3 who then
counted the money, which amounted to RM1,500. PW3 then made a police
report and a MACC report regarding the incident and handed over RM3,000
which is the subject matter of the two charges herein, and which he had
recovered from the respondent, to the MACC officer.

Consideration Of The Appeal
Whether The Two Consents To Prosecute (Exhibits B And C Respectively) Are
Proper And Valid

[8]
Section 58 of Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 2009 reads as
follows:
A prosecution for an offence under this Act shall not be instituted except
by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.

[9]
In the present appeal, the appellant tendered two consents to prosecute
namely (exhs. P(B) & P(C) respectively) pertaining to the first and second
charges preferred against the respondent. Lines 9 to 12 of the two consents
to prosecute (exhs. P(B) & P(C)) read as follows:

... committed on the 18th June 2017, at 6.30am and 1pm, on the vessel
named One United 15, at position 04 degree 13.4.70 minutes North, 113
degree 03.739 minutes East, in Malaysia Water, in the State of Sarawak.

[10] As regards the first charge, the offence was allegedly committed by the
respondent at the following co-ordinates namely, 04 degree 13.470 minutes
North, 113 degree 03.739 minutes East. This was also confirmed by PW3
in his witness statement and also in his police report marked as exh. P3.
However, the relevant consent to prosecute showed that the offence as stated
in the first charge was committed “… at position 04 degree 13.4.70 minutes
North, 113 degree 03.739 minutes East.”
[11] In respect of the second charge, the appellant’s consent to prosecute
(exh. P(C)) at lines 9 to 12 read as follows: “… committed on 18 June 2017,
at 6.30am and 1pm, on the vessel named One United 15, at position 04
degree 13.4.70 minutes North, 113 degree 03.739 minutes East, in Malaysia
Water, in the State of Sarawak.”
[12] For the second charge, the offence was allegedly committed when the
vessel was at the following co-ordinates namely, 03 degree 49.541 minutes
North, 113 degree 03.626 minutes East, in Malaysian waters at about 1pm.
This was also stated in the evidence of PW3 that the fishing vessel was at
the above said coordinates when the respondent allegedly offered the money
which is the subject matter of the second charge to PW3.
[13] In the light of the above, the respondent contended that there was
nothing in the appellant’s consent to prosecute (exh. P(C)) to such effect as
the relevant consent to prosecute merely showed that the offence under
s. 17(b) of the MACC Act 2009 was committed by the respondent at the
following coordinates: “.. committed on 18 June 2017, at 6.30am and 1pm,
on the vessel named One United 15, at position 04 degree 13.4.70 minutes
North, 113 degree 03.739 minutes East, in Malaysia Water, in the State of
Sarawak.”
[14] Having perused the first charge and with cross-reference to the first
consent to prosecute (exh. P(B)), this court finds that the particulars are
almost the same except that there is an insertion of “1pm” in the said first
consent to prosecute (exh. P(B)).
[15] A perusal of the second charge and with cross-reference to the second
consent to prosecute (exh. P(C)), revealed that the difference is in the position
of the vessel “One United 15” at Malaysia waters where the bribe given by
the respondent to PW3.



242

Current Law Journal

[2018] 4 CLJ

[16] In the light of the above, this court finds that such differences in the
particulars in the two consents to prosecute, are minor, not material and do
not occasion any miscarriage of justice to the respondent in respect of both
charges, as the first consent to prosecute (exh. P(B)) and the second consent
to prosecute (exh. P(C)) stated that both incidents occurred at two different
times and in Malaysia waters respectively.
[17] There is no miscarriage of justice, with the omission of the position
of the coordinates of the vessel “One United 15” at Malaysia waters, as long
as the date, time, offence, the name of the respondent and that the offence
occurred in Malaysia waters are stated. These particulars sufficiently showed
the Public Prosecutor’s intention to prefer the two charges against the
respondent as per the charges respectively. Further, the respondent was
represented by learned counsel since the beginning of the trial till this present
appeal and the issue of the consents to prosecute is never raised by the
respondent at any stage. In the light of the above findings, this court finds
such minor and immaterial differences in both “consent to prosecute” are
mere irregularities which are curable under s. 422 of the Criminal Procedure
Code because they do not occasion any miscarriage of justice to the
respondent in respect of both charges.
[18] Guidance can be found in Manimaran Amas v. PP & Other Cases [2014]
1 LNS 1412; [2015] 1 MLJ 18, where the Court of Appeal held as follows:

A

B

C

D

E

Learned counsel for the second appellant had also submitted on the issue
of consent of the public prosecutor under s. 177A(1) of the Criminal
Procedure Code (exh. P1) which was argued to be defective, resulting in
the charge being defective as well.
The consent speaks of consent to prosecute the appellants ‘bersama tiga
orang lagi yang masih bebas’ for the offence under s. 302, but the charge
itself is absent of those words. And although the name of the deceased
was stated in the charge, it was not stated in the consent. We found no
merits in the issues raised by learned counsel, which merely concerned the
inconsistencies between the consent and the charge. In our view, the
inconsistencies had not occasioned any injustice to the appellants and
could be cured under s. 422 of the Criminal Procedure Code. (emphasis

receiver;

(ii) That at the time of the offers, payment, gift or receipt, the receiver was

Whether A Gratification Was Offered, Paid Or Given To Or Received By The
Receiver
[21] In the present appeal, PW3 testified that after he pursued and then
boarded the respondent’s vessel on 18 June 2017 at 6.10am, he asked the
respondent to surrender all relevant documents to him such as licences and
others. The respondent then handed one transparent file folder containing
personal belongings, all passports, licences and money. Inside the said file
folder, PW3 saw Malaysia banknotes in denominations of RM50, amounting
to RM1,500, after being counted by PW3.
[22] PW3 also testified that while he was holding the file folder, PW3
asked the respondent who is the captain of the fishing vessel why there is
money inside the file folder. PW3 testified that the respondent did not
answer him except nodding his head upwards and PW3 testified that in his
understanding, the respondent wanted to bribe him so that PW3 will not to
take action against his vessel which might have committed certain offences.

H

I

[23] PW3 testified that later on, at 1pm on the same day, the respondent
showed him, one cabinet by using the respondent’s right hand to point at the
cabinet. PW3 then directed PW4 to open the said cabinet and inside the said
cabinet, PW3 found an amount of money in a denomination of RM100
notes. PW4 took the said money and showed to PW3. PW3 then showed the
said money to the respondent and asked the respondent, what was the money



244

Current Law Journal

[2018] 4 CLJ

for. According to PW3, the respondent was again nodding his head and PW3
interpreted this action of the respondent, as asking the PW3, to take the said
money.
[24] PW3 also testified that he warned the respondent, that his action of
trying to give money to PW3, is an offence in the English language.
However, PW3 said that the respondent still nodding his head as a sign to
PW3, to take the money. PW3 then asked PW4 to count the money which
amounted to RM1,500.
[25] The pertinent issue is whether the respondent had corruptly offered,
paid or give to PW3, the monies which are the subject matters of the two
charges, as a gratification for not taking any legal action against him, the crew
and his vessel. In the present appeal, there were two instances of purported
acts of briberies, firstly when the respondent in response to PW3’s request,
handed a transparent file folder containing the vessel’s licence, passports of
the crew and RM1,500 and secondly when the respondent some six hours
later after the first purported act of bribery, pointed to a cabinet where PW4
found RM1,500. In both purported acts of bribery, the appellant contended
that the respondent was nodding his head upwards as signal for PW3 to take
the total sum of RM3,000 as bribes. PW3 construed the nodding of the
respondent’s head as a signal for PW3, to take the money as bribes.
[26] This court finds that such non-verbal gestures of the nodding of the
respondent’s head at the said two occasions are capable of a number of
interpretations and do not necessarily mean that the respondent was
indicating to PW3 to take the monies on the two occasions as bribes. Any
favourable interpretation should be drawn in favour of the respondent who
is the accused in this appeal.
[27] It is undisputed both PW3 and the respondent could not communicate
with each other at all as the respondent is a Vietnamese and only can
communicate in Vietnam language and not in the English language and PW3
on the other hand agreed that he could not speak the Vietnamese language.

[28] PW3 testified that upon his request, the respondent handed the
transparent file folder which contained all personal belongings, all passports
of the crew, licences and cash money of RM1,500. When the respondent
handed the transparent file folder to PW3, the said sum of RM1,500 was
already inside the said transparent file folder.

H

[29] PW3 alleged that he asked the respondent in the English language as
to why there was money inside the said transparent file folder and also the
money inside the cabinet. On both occasions, PW3 testified that he warned
the respondent that it is an offence by trying to give money/bribe to PW3
in the English language.

[2018] 4 CLJ

PP v. Nguyen Van Thin

245

A

[30] Since the respondent could not understand the English language, thus,
it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the respondent could understand
what PW3 had asked or warned him about. This is substantiated by the
testimony of PW3 who agreed that the respondent simply could not
understand what the maritime officers were talking to him.

B

[31] This court finds that the mere handing over of the transparent file
folder containing all personal belongings, all passports of the crew, licences
and cash money of RM1,500 accompanied with a nodding of the head do not
per se constitute an offering of a bribe to PW3. The RM1,500 could have been
kept inside the said file folder for safe keeping along with the other
documents. It would be a dangerous precedent to set that mere handing over
a file folder containing all personal belongings, all passports of the crew,
licences and cash money of RM1,500 accompanied with a nodding of the
head per se constituted an offering of a bribe. There has to be more.

[32] This court is in agreement with the learned Sessions Court Judge’s
finding that PW3 merely assumed that the respondent tried to bribe him on
both occasions with the money when PW3 said that the respondent was
merely nodding his head upwards when PW3 asked about the money was for
what purpose, whereby, PW3 concluded that the respondent was trying to
bribe him on both occasions.
[33] In the light of this court’s above-findings, this court finds that the
prosecution has failed to prove the first ingredient of the offences preferred
against the respondent.
Whether At The Time Of The Offer, Payment, Gift Or Receipt, The Receiver Was
In The Employment Of A Public Body
[34] This court finds that this ingredient is not disputed and is proven.
Exhibit P1, ie: “Perakuan Jawatan and the service record of PW3, Mohd
Zahir bin Mohamad Basri” showed that he was Lieutenant of the Agensi
Penguatkuasaan MARITIM Malaysia, Sarawak at that material time. The
testimony of PW1 (Suhardi bin Manjeli – Timbalan Pengarah Pengurusan of
the Agensi Penguatkuasaan MARITIM Malaysia, Miri, Sarawak) and PW2
(Mohd Nor Saifuddin bin Jamaluddin – a Lieutenant of the Agensi
Penguatkuasaan MARITIM Malaysia, Miri, Sarawak) as well as the PW4
(Mohammad Takdir Ramadhani bin Abdul Ghani – Lascar of the Agensi

Whether The Gratification Was Paid Or Given Or Offered Corruptly As An
Inducement For Doing An Act In Relation To The Affairs Of That Public Body
[35] The appellant contended that since the three elements of the offence
are proven, the presumption under s. 50 of MACC 2009 is thus triggered
against the respondent. The testimonies of PW3 and PW4 have confirmed
that the respondent gave RM1,500 to PW3, to refrain from taking action
against the respondent who allegedly committed an offence under s. 8(a) of
the Fisheries Act 1985 for the first charge and the respondent also gave
RM1,500 to PW3, to refrain from taking action against the respondent who
allegedly committed an offence under s. 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act
1959/63 for the second charge.
[36] In the present appeal, this court found that the appellant had failed to
show that the respondent had offered or given the alleged bribe monies
totaling RM3,000 ie, RM1,500 for each of the charges preferred against the
respondent, for not taking any action against the respondent together with his
crews and vessel, for allegedly having committed an offence under the s. 8(a)
of the Fisheries Act 1985 and s. 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act, respectively.
[37] Further, there was no clear evidence to show that the respondent, his
crew and the vessel had breached any laws of Malaysia in particular under
the Fisheries Act 1985 or under s. 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63
as contended by PW3. This is substantiated by PW2, the investigating officer
of the case from the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency who
confirmed that all of the 21 crews had been released as they have not
committed any offences under the Fisheries Act 1985, Immigration Act
1959/63 and Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952.

[38] The fact that even though investigation papers opened for investigation
under s. 8(a) of the Fisheries Act 1985, for alleged illegal fishing without
licence when the licence for this vessel is meant for cargo instead of fishing
activity and under s. 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63, for alleged
illegal entry into Malaysia without valid identification document. There
were no charges preferred against the respondent and this showed that no
offences were committed by the respondent thus there was no necessity for
the respondent to offer any bribes to PW3.
[39] In the light of this court’s above-findings, this court finds that no
gratification was paid or given or offered corruptly as an inducement for
doing an act in relation to the affairs of that public body as the respondent
did not commit any offence. Thus, there was no necessity for the respondent
to offer any bribes.

Whether The Presumption Under s. 50(1) Of The Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009 Can Be Invoked
[40] The appellant contended that since the three elements of the offence
preferred are proven, the presumption under s. 50 of MACC 2009 is thus
triggered against the respondent. The testimonies of PW3 and PW4
confirmed that the respondent gave RM1,500 to PW3, to refrain from taking
action against the respondent who allegedly committed an offence under
s. 8(a) of the Fisheries Act 1985 for the first charge and another RM1,500
to PW3, to refrain from taking action against the respondent who allegedly
committed an offence under s. 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 for
the second charge.
[41] In PP v. Yuvaraj [1968] 1 LNS 116; [1969] 2 MLJ 89 at p 90, the court
held, inter alia, as follows:

Where a defendant is charged with an offence under s. 4(a) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act 1961, to which s. 14 also applied, the onus
lies upon the prosecution to prove the first two factual ingredients of the
offence, viz (1) that a gratification was paid or given to or received by the
defendant and (2) that at the same time of the payment, gift or receipt
he was in the employment of a public body. Upon proof of these two
ingredients the existence of the third ingredient, viz (3) that the
gratification was paid or given or received corruptly as an inducement or
reward for doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to the affairs of
that public body, is to be presumed unless the contrary is proved.

[42] In the light of this court’s above-findings that the appellant failed to
prove that the respondent offered or paid any bribes to PW3 and no
gratification was paid or given or offered corruptly as an inducement for
doing an act in relation to the affairs of that public body, this court holds that
the presumption under s. 50 of MACC 2009 is not triggered.

[43] In the light of this court’s above-findings and based on the test as laid
down by the Federal Court in the case of Balachandran v. PP [2005] 1 CLJ
85, this court finds that the appellant has failed to prove a prima facie case
against the respondent in respect of the first and second charges preferred
against the respondent. In the premises, this court thus affirms the order of
the learned Sessions Court Judge and hereby orders that the respondent to
be discharged and acquitted. The money of RM3,000 (exh. P6) to be
returned to the respondent after the expiry of the appeal period.
