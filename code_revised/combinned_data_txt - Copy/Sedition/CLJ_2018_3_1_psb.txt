The respondent was charged in the Sessions Court with an offence of
publishing a seditious publication, an offence under s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition
Act 1948 (‘the Act’). The respondent pleaded not guilty and claimed trial to
the charge. Subsequently, vide an amended notice of motion at the High
Court, the respondent sought, inter alia, an order that s. 4 of the Act is
inconsistent with art. 10 of the Federal Constitution (‘FC’) and sought to be
acquitted and discharged from the charge. However, the High Court held that
s. 4(1)(c) of the Act was not ultra vires the FC and dismissed the respondent’s
application. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision and
directed the respondent to appear before the Sessions Court to enable the case
to be heard on its merits. The respondent applied for a stay by submitting
that as a matter of public interest, the questions of law which were raised
needed to be argued before the Federal Court. The Court of Appeal granted
the stay. However, before the appeal filed by the respondent to the Federal
Court could be heard, the respondent withdrew the appeal in consequence
to the decision in Siow Chung Peng v. PP where the Federal Court held that
pursuant to s. 87(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964, the Federal Court’s
jurisdiction did not extend to decisions of the High Court made in respect of
a case tried or to be tried by a subordinate court. The respondent

subsequently filed an application vide encl. 1 for a declaration that s. 3 of the
Act read with s. 4 the same Act was inconsistent with art. 10(1)(a) of the FC.
In dismissing the respondent’s application in encl. 1, the High Court held that
the respondent’s application was an abuse of the process. The Court of
Appeal set aside the High Court decision, considered the merits of encl. 1,
and made a declaration that s. 3(3) of the Act contravened art. 10 of the FC
and was therefore invalid and of no effect in law. Hence, the Federal Court
granted leave to appeal to the appellant on the following questions of law:
(i) whether a challenge to the constitutionality of s. 3 of the Act made in civil
proceedings when the same had been determined by the Court of Appeal in
a criminal appeal involving the same applicant amounts to an abuse of the
process of the court; (ii) whether a challenge to the constitutionality of s. 3
of the Act made in civil proceedings is res judicata in view of a prior similar
challenge in criminal proceedings by the same applicant; and (iii) whether
s. 3(3) of the Act contravenes art. 10 of the FC and was therefore invalid and
of no effect in law.

Held (allowing appeal; setting aside decision of Court of Appeal in respect
of encl. 1 and reinstating decision of High Court in respect of encl. 1)
Per Ahmad Maarop CJ (Malaya) delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) The Court of Appeal, in its judgment, did not consider at all the crucial
issue as to whether encl. 1 is an abuse of the process. The Court of
Appeal had considered the issue of res judicata, but not the applicability
or otherwise of the doctrine of the abuse of the process. Res judicata is
separate and distinct from the doctrine of abuse of the process although
both rest on the same underlying public interests - namely, that there
should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be vexed twice
in the same matter. Even if res judicata was not applicable to bar
encl. 1, it still could not stand if it was found to be an abuse of process.
(paras 41 & 43)
(2) The approach on the determination of an abuse of the process should be
‘[a] broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and
private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the
case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the
circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by
seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before’;
(Johnson v. Gore Wood & Co). The ‘merits’ in the phrase ‘broad meritsbased judgment’ were not the substantive merits or otherwise of the
actual claim, but those relevant to the question whether the claimant
could or should have brought his claim as part of the earlier proceeding.
It must also be borne in mind that ‘one cannot comprehensively list all
possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule
to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not.’

(3) In order to establish the charge against the respondent under s. 4(1)(c)
of the Act, the prosecution has to prove the ‘act of publishing a seditious
publication’. The answer as to what is a ‘seditious publication’ is found
under s. 2 of the Act and in order to prove a ‘seditious tendency’, the
prosecution has to rely on s. 3(1) of the Act. In the context of the charge
against the respondent, the tendency under s. 3(1)(a) and the tendency
under 3(1)(d) were relevant. In considering whether any act, speech,
words, publication or other thing has any seditious tendency under
s. 3(1), regard must be had to the exception under s. 3(2) of the Act
which provides that an act, speech, words, publication or other thing
shall not be deemed to be seditious by reason only that it has a tendency
provided under ss. 3(2)(a), (b), and (c) of the Act.(paras 62, 64-67)
(4) Once it was proven that the publication published by the respondent had
a seditious tendency as provided under s. 3(1), read with s. 2 of the Act,
the offence under s. 4(1)(c) of the Act against the respondent would be
established, and by virtue of s. 3(3), the respondent’s intention of
publishing the publication shall be deemed irrelevant. The deeming of
the intention of the person charged as being irrelevant in s. 3(3) of
the Act was the target of the respondent’s challenge on the
constitutionality of that section. Because of the interplay between
ss. 4(1)(c), 2, 3(1), 3(2) and 3(3) of the Act, bearing in mind the criminal
charge preferred in the criminal proceeding, when the respondent
challenged the constitutionality of s. 4(1) for the purpose of the
impugning the charge, he could not leave out the constitutionality of
s. 3(3) which deems intention to be irrelevant once seditious tendency
is proven. (para 69)
(5) The respondent should have challenged the constitutionality of s. 3(3) in
the notice of motion in the criminal proceeding. However, there was
nothing in the affidavit filed in support of encl. 1 in the notice of motion
to explain why this issue was not raised in the criminal proceeding.
There was also nothing akin to fresh evidence which might warrant the
raising of this issue only in encl. 1. Having considered all the
circumstances, encl. 1 was held to be an abuse of the process. On this
ground alone encl. 1 should be dismissed. Thus, the Court of Appeal
erred in allowing the respondent’s appeal and in considering the merits
of the application in encl. 1 and this clearly warranted interference.
(para 69)
(6) The court did not subscribe to the view that the doctrine of res judicata
does not apply to a challenge upon the constitutionality of a statute. The
basis on which the doctrine of res judicata rests is founded on the
consideration of public policy that it is in the public interest that there
should be finality in litigation and decisions made by courts of



Current Law Journal

4

[2018] 3 CLJ

competent jurisdiction, and that no one should be vexed twice for the
same kind of litigation. Therefore, there was no reason why the doctrine
of constructive res judicata should not apply to a challenge on the
constitutionality of a statute. (para 72)
(7) Enclosure 1 was an abuse of the process and as such, should be
dismissed without the need to consider the merits of the application.
Hence, it was unnecessary for the court to answer the first and second
leave questions as framed. In view of that finding, there was also no
necessity for the court to consider the third leave question. The decision
of the Court of Appeal in respect of encl. 1 was set aside and the trial
of the respondent in respect of the charge under s. 4(1)(c) of the Act was
ordered to proceed. (paras 79-82)

Responden dipertuduh di Mahkamah Sesyen dengan kesalahan menerbitkan
penerbitan menghasut, satu kesalahan bawah s. 4(1)(c) Akta Hasutan 1948
(‘Akta’). Responden tidak mengaku bersalah dan memohon dibicarakan
terhadap pertuduhan itu. Kemudian, melalui satu notis usul dipinda di
Mahkamah Tinggi, responden memohon satu perintah, antara lain, bahawa
s. 4 Akta tidak konsisten dengan per. 10 Perlembagaan Persekutuan
(‘Perlembagaan’) dan memohon pelepasan dan pembebasan daripada
pertuduhan. Walau bagaimanapun, Mahkamah Tinggi memutuskan bahawa
s. 4(1)(c) Akta bukan ultra vires Perlembagaan dan menolak permohonan
responden. Atas rayuan, Mahkamah Rayuan mengekalkan keputusan
tersebut dan mengarahkan responden hadir di Mahkamah Sesyen untuk
membolehkan merit kes dibicarakan. Responden memohon untuk
penangguhan, menghujahkah bahawa sebagai perkara kepentingan umum,
soalan undang-undang yang dibangkitkan perlu dihujahkan di Mahkamah
Persekutuan. Mahkamah Rayuan membenarkan penangguhan. Walau
bagaimanapun, sebelum rayuan yang difailkan oleh responden ke Mahkamah
Persekutuan didengar, responden menarik balik rayuan berikutan keputusan
dalam kes Siow Chung Peng v. PP di mana Mahkamah Persekutuan
memutuskan bahawa menurut s. 87(1) Akta Mahkamah Kehakiman 1964,
bidang kuasa Mahkamah Persekutuan tidak berlanjut kepada keputusan
Mahkamah Tinggi yang dibuat berkaitan kes yang dibicarakan atau akan
dibicarakan di mahkamah rendah. Responden kemudiannya memfailkan
permohonan dalam lampiran 1 bagi deklarasi bahawa s. 3 Akta dibaca
bersama-sama dengan s. 4 Akta tidak konsisten dengan per. 10(1)(a)
Perlembagaan. Menolak permohonan responden dalam lampiran 1,
Mahkamah Tinggi memutuskan bahawa permohonan responden adalah
penyalahgunaan proses. Mahkamah Rayuan mengetepikan keputusan
Mahkamah Tinggi, mempertimbangkan merit lampiran 1 dan memberikan
deklarasi bahawa s. 3(3) Akta melanggar per. 10 Perlembagaan dan dengan
itu tidak sah dan tiada kesan dari segi undang-undang. Dengan itu,

Mahkamah Persekutuan memberikan kebenaran untuk merayu kepada
perayu atas soalan undang-undang berikut: (i) sama ada tindakan mencabar
keperlembagaan s. 3 Akta yang dibuat dalam prosiding sivil di mana
persoalan tersebut telah diputuskan oleh Mahkamah Rayuan dalam rayuan
jenayah melibatkan pemohon yang sama terjumlah pada penyalahgunaan
proses mahkamah; (ii) sama ada tindakan mencabar keperlembagaan s. 3
Akta yang dibuat dalam prosiding sivil adalah res judicata berikutan tindakan
mencabar yang sama telah dibuat dalam prosiding jenayah oleh pemohon
yang sama; dan (iii) sama ada s. 3(3) Akta bercanggah dengan per. 10
Perlembagaan dan oleh itu tidak sah dan tiada kesan undang-undang.

Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan; mengetepikan keputusan Mahkamah
Rayuan berkaitan lampiran 1 dan mengembalikan keputusan Mahkamah
Tinggi berkaitan lampiran 1)
Oleh Ahmad Maarop HB (Malaya) menyampaikan penghakiman
mahkamah:

D

(1) Mahkamah Rayuan, dalam penghakimannya, tidak mempertimbangkan
langsung isu penting sama ada lampiran 1 adalah penyalahgunaan proses.
Mahkamah Rayuan telah mempertimbangkan isu res judicata tetapi
bukan penggunaan atau sebaliknya doktrin penyalahgunaan proses.
Res judicata berasingan dan berbeza daripada doktrin penyalahgunaan
proses walaupun kedua-duanya mempunyai kepentingan umum yang
sama - iaitu kemuktamadan litigasi dan sesuatu pihak tidak boleh
disusahkan dua kali dalam perkara yang sama. Walaupun res judicata
tidak terpakai untuk menghalang lampiran 1, ia masih tidak boleh
dikekalkan jika didapati terjumlah pada satu penyalahgunaan proses.

(2) Pendekatan bagi pemutusan penyalahgunaan proses sepatutnya
‘[a] broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and
private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the
case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the
circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by
seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before’;
(Johnson v. Gore Wood & Co). ‘Merits’ dalam frasa ‘broad merits-based
judgment’ bukan merit substantif atau sebaliknya bagi tuntutan sebenar,
tetapi sesuatu yang relevan pada soalan sama ada penuntut boleh atau
sepatutnya membawa tuntutannya sebagai sebahagian prosiding
sebelumnya. Perlu diingati bahawa ‘seseorang tidak boleh
menyenaraikan secara komprehensif kesemua bentuk penyalahgunaan,
oleh itu, seseorang tidak boleh mengemukakan kaedah tertentu untuk
menentukan sama ada, atas fakta, penemuan berkaitan penyalahgunaan
boleh dibuat atau tidak.’

(3) Bagi membuktikan pertuduhan terhadap responden bawah s. 4(1)(c)
Akta, pihak pendakwaan perlu membuktikan ‘tindakan menerbitkan
penerbitan menghasut’. Jawapan kepada apa itu ‘penerbitan menghasut’
didapati bawah s. 2 Akta dan untuk membuktikan ‘kecenderungan
menghasut’, pihak pendakwaan perlu menyandar atas s. 3(1) Akta.
Dalam konteks pertuduhan terhadap responden, kecenderungan bawah
s. 3(1)(a) dan kecenderungan bawah s. 3(1)(d) relevan. Dalam
mempertimbangkan sama ada mana-mana tindakan, ucapan, perkataanperkataan, penerbitan atau perkara lain mempunyai kecenderungan
menghasut bawah s. 3(1), perlu dipertimbangkan pengecualian bawah
s. 3(2) Akta yang memperuntukkan bahawa tindakan, ucapan,
perkataan-perkataan, penerbitan atau perkara lain tidak boleh dianggap
menghasut semata-mata atas alasan bahawa ia mempunyai
kecenderungan yang diperuntukkan bawah ss. 3(2)(a), (b), dan (c) Akta.
(4) Sebaik sahaja dibuktikan bahawa penerbitan yang diterbitkan oleh
responden mempunyai kecenderungan menghasut seperti yang
diperuntukkan bawah s. 3(1) dibaca bersama-sama dengan s. 2 Akta,
kesalahan bawah s. 4(1)(c) Akta terhadap responden akan terbukti, dan
menurut s. 3(3), niat responden dalam menerbitkan penerbitan tersebut
dianggap tidak relevan. Anggapan terhadap niat seseorang sebagai tidak
relevan dalam s. 3(3) Akta adalah sasaran cabaran responden terhadap
keperlembagaan seksyen itu. Disebabkan saling tindakan antara
ss. 4(1)(c), 2, 3(1), 3(2) dan 3(3) Akta, mempertimbangkan pertuduhan
jenayah yang dikenakan dalam prosiding jenayah, apabila responden
mencabar keperlembagaan s. 4(1) bagi tujuan mempersoalkan
pertuduhan tersebut, dia tidak boleh meninggalkan keperlembagaan
s. 3(3) yang menganggap niat tidak relevan sebaik sahaja kecenderungan
menghasut dibuktikan.
(5) Responden sepatutnya mencabar keperlembagaan s. 3(3) dalam notis
usul dalam prosiding jenayah. Walau bagaimanapun, tiada apa-apa
dalam afidavit yang difailkan bagi menyokong lampiran 1 dalam notis
usul untuk menjelaskan mengapa isu ini tidak dibangkitkan dalam
prosiding jenayah. Juga tiada apa-apa yang menyerupai keterangan baru
yang mungkin mewajarkan penimbulan isu ini hanya dalam lampiran 1.
Setelah mempertimbangkan kesemua keadaan kes, lampiran 1
diputuskan sebagai penyalahgunaan proses. Atas alasan ini sahaja
lampiran 1 wajar ditolak. Oleh itu, Mahkamah Rayuan khilaf apabila
membenarkan rayuan responden dan dalam mempertimbangkan merit
permohonan lampiran 1 dan ini jelas mewajarkan campur tangan.
(6) Mahkamah tidak menyetujui pendapat bahawa doktrin res judicata tidak
terpakai dalam cabaran terhadap keperlembagaan sesuatu statut. Asas
bagi doktrin res judicata adalah berdasarkan pertimbangan polisi awam
bahawa kepentingan awam memerlukan kemuktamadan dalam litigasi
dan keputusan-keputusan mahkamah berbidang kuasa kompeten, dan

tiada seorang pun yang wajar disusahkan kali kedua bagi litigasi yang
sama. Oleh itu, tiada sebab mengapa doktrin res judicata konstruktif tidak
boleh terpakai untuk mencabar keperlembagaan statut.
(7) Lampiran 1 adalah penyalahgunaan proses dan oleh itu, wajar ditolak
tanpa merit permohonan dipertimbangkan. Dengan itu, tidak perlu bagi
mahkamah menjawab soalan-soalan kebenaran pertama dan kedua
seperti yang dirangka. Berikutan dapatan tersebut, juga tiada keperluan
untuk mahkamah mempertimbangkan soalan kebenaran ketiga.
Keputusan Mahkamah Rayuan berkaitan dengan lampiran 1 diketepikan
dan perbicaraan responden berkaitan pertuduhan bawah s. 4(1)(c) Akta
diperintahkan untuk diteruskan.

Ahmad Maarop CJ (Malaya):
[1]
This case concerns an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal
reversing the decision of the High Court, which had, on 23 December 2015
dismissed the respondent’s application in Originating Summons No. 24-3609-2014 (encl. 1). In encl. 1, the respondent applied for a declaration that
s. 3 of the Sedition Act 1948 (Act 15) read with s. 4 the same Act was
inconsistent with (bercanggah dengan) art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal
Constitution. In dismissing the respondent’s application in encl. 1, the
High Court held that the respondent’s application was an abuse of the
process. The Court of Appeal set aside the High Court decision, considered
the merits of encl. 1, and made the following declaration:

F

G

Section 3(3) of the Sedition Act 1948, contravenes Article 10 of the
Federal Constitution and therefore is invalid and of no effect in law.

The background facts leading to the present appeal are these. On
7 February 2011, the respondent was charged in the Sessions Court, Shah
Alam with an offence of publishing a seditious publication, an offence under

Rakyat, amalan dan konvensyen ini tidak dibuat. Saya yakin dan percaya
rakyat Selangor mahu YAB Dato’ Menteri Besarnya dihormati oleh
semua pihak termasuk pihak istana. Rakyat akan menolak sebarang
tindakan “beraja di mata, bersultan di hati” oleh mana-mana pihak yang
bertindak sewenang-wenangnya, tidak kira sama ada oleh raja yang
berjiwa rakyat atau rakyat yang berjiwa raja. Janganlah kerana hendak
menegakkan benang yang basah, institusi negeri yang dihormati rakyat
dijadikan perkakas oleh mana-mana pihak berkepentingan. Saya meneliti
juga kenyataan Setiausaha Sulit tersebut yang menyatakan baginda
DYMM Sultan Selangor seorang sultan yang tegas dan tidak berganjak
dari keputusan yang telah dibuat. Bagaimana sekiranya keputusan yang
dibuat atau cara keputusan itu dibuat adalah salah? Adakah baginda
masih tidak akan berganjak? Harapan saya supaya ketegasan tidak
dikelirukan dengan ego.
Dalam sejarah telah terbukti, apabila rakyat bangkit menentang Raja,
biarpun beribu tahun kebangkitan itu berlangsung akhirnya kebenaran
akan menghenyak ketidakadilan. Rakyat akan menang dalam peperangan
menentang ketidakadilan! Didoakan agar ia tidak berlaku di Selangor.

The respondent pleaded not guilty and claimed trial to the charge.
Before the commencement of the trial, the respondent filed a criminal
application in the High Court, Shah Alam by way of a notice of motion dated
1 April 2011. In the amended notice of motion pursuant to the order of the
High Court dated 21 July 2011, the respondent sought the following prayers:
(1) Bahawa pendakwaan jenayah terhadap Pemohon di Mahkamah
Sesyen Shah Alam Kes Tangkap No. 611-2011 dibatalkan (“strike

On 19 January 2012, Noor Azian Shaari J held that s. 4(1)(c) of
Act 15 was not ultra vires the Federal Constitution and dismissed the
respondent’s application in the notice of motion. The respondent appealed
to the Court of Appeal. On 26 December 2013, the Court of Appeal
dismissed the respondent’s appeal and upheld the decision of the High Court.
The Court of Appeal directed that the respondent appear before the Sessions
Court on 5 June 2013 for mention to enable the Sessions Court Judge to hear
the case on its merits.
[8]
Learned counsel for the respondent applied for a stay, submitting that
as a matter of public interest, the questions of law which were raised need
to be argued before the Federal Court. The Court of Appeal granted stay.
[9]
The respondent then filed an appeal to this court. However, before the
appeal could be heard on 20 October 2014, the respondent withdrew the
appeal. The withdrawal was in consequence to the decision in the case of
Siow Chung Peng v. PP [2014] 6 CLJ 423; [2014] 4 MLJ 504, where this court
held that pursuant to s. 87(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964, the
Federal Court’s jurisdiction did not extend to decisions of the High Court
made in respect of a case tried or to be tried by a subordinate court.
[10] On 25 September 2014, the respondent filed Originating Summons
No. 24-36-09-2014 (encl. 1) (which is the subject of the present appeal),
praying for the following relief:

F

(1) A declaration that section 3 of the Sedition Act 1948 read with
section 4 thereof violates Article 10(1)(a) of the Federal
Constitution and is accordingly null and void.
(2) That there be no order as to costs.
(3) That such further or other relief or orders or directions be granted
or made as this Honourable Court deems just.

[11] At the outset of the appeal, we directed parties to firstly, submit on
the first two questions of law referred to at para. 2 of this judgment. We
indicated to parties that we would proceed to hear submissions on the third
question if the first two questions were decided against the appellant.
The Appellant’s Submission
[12] Relying on his written submission, the thrust of the argument of the
learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) submitting for the appellant is as
follows. What was in issue before the court in the originating summons
which is the subject matter of the present appeal is ss. 3 and 4 of Act 15. The
crux of the matter had been decided by the High Court pursuant to the notice
of motion filed in Criminal Application No. 44-72-2011, and the decision
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Criminal Appeal No: B-09-212-09-

2011 reported as Mat Shuhaimi Shafiei v. PP [2014] 5 CLJ 22 (Shuhaimi I).
In the notice of motion in Shuhaimi I, the focus was on the constitutionality
of s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15. However, according to the learned SFC that section
could not be read in isolation but must be read with s. 3 of Act 15. The latter
section must be invoked to interpret s. 4 of Act 15. There are four paragraphs
to s. 4(1) of Act 15 which includes s. 4(1)(c). One cannot challenge s. 4(1)(a),
4(1)(b), 4(1)(c), and 4(1)(d) of Act 15 separately. In this case the whole of
s. 4 was held to be constitutional by the Court of Appeal in Shuhaimi I. It
was argued that when the respondent challenged the constitutionality of s. 4,
since that section must be read with s. 3, the respondent should not withhold
the challenge and the argument on the constitutionality of s. 3(3) to be taken
up later. One cannot present one’s case by instalments. It was contended that
it was not proper for the respondent to use the motion in the civil proceeding
to circumvent the decision of the court made in the criminal proceeding
(Shuhaimi I). Referring to para. 18 in the Court of Appeal’s judgment in
Shuhaimi I, the learned SFC pointed out that learned counsel for the
respondent submitted in the Court of Appeal that s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15 read
with the definition of ‘seditious tendency’ in s. 3 of the same Act amounts
to an unreasonable restriction of the appellant’s right to ‘freedom of speech
and expression’ under art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution and that being
the case, s. 4(1)(c) of the same Act is rendered unconstitutional and should
be struck out. According to the learned SFC, the Court of Appeal responded
to that submission by holding that Act 15 was still good and valid law. It falls
squarely within the framework of art. 10(2) of the Federal Constitution and
its validity and constitutionality could not be challenged. The court also held
that s. 4(1) of Act 15 did not infringe the reasonable and the proportionality
test by virtue of s. 3(2) of Act 15, and hence it is constitutional. Paragraphs
[115] to [117] of the Court of Appeal’s judgment were referred to by the
learned SFC. Therefore, he submitted the respondent should not be allowed
to litigate the constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act 15 on the same facts and point
of law. In support of his submission, the learned SFC relied on Hunter v. Chief
Constable of the West Midlands [1981] 3 All ER 727, Tractors (M) Bhd v. Charles
Au Yong [1982] CLJ 152; [1982] CLJ (Rep) 355; [1982] 1 MLJ 320,

The Respondent’s Submission
[13] Starting his submission, learned counsel for the respondent contended
that the validity of Act 15 was not in issue before the Court of Appeal, insofar
as the criminal case was concerned. Any comment by the Court of Appeal
as to the constitutionality of Act 15 as a whole was entirely obiter dicta.
Learned counsel referred to s. 3(3) of the Sedition Act which provides that:
(3) For the purpose of proving the commission of any offence against this
Act the intention of the person charged at the time he did or attempted
to do or made any preparation to do or conspired with any person to do

any act or uttered any seditious words or printed, published, sold, offered
for sale, distributed, reproduced or imported any publication or did any
other thing shall be deemed to be irrelevant if in fact the act had, or
would, if done, have had, or the words, publication or thing had a
seditious tendency.

Learned counsel then submitted that the provision was never the subject of
any argument in Shuhaimi I, or under consideration by the court.

[14] Learned counsel next submitted that the doctrine of constructive
res judicata had no application to a challenge upon the constitutionality of a
statute. In support of his argument he referred to the judgment of the Indian
Supreme Court in Nand Kishore v. State of Punjab [1995] 6 SCC 614.
[15] On the requirement for res judicata, learned counsel submitted that to
constitute a res judicata, the earlier judgment must “necessarily and with
precision” determine the point in issue. In support, he referred to the
following passage in the judgment of Chang Min Tat FJ in Tong Lee Hwa &
Anor. v. Lee Yoke San [1978] 1 LNS 218; [1979] 1 MLJ 24:
At the hearing of the appeal, it was put to counsel for the appellants that
to constitute a res judicata, the earlier judgment must, in terms of the Privy
Council decision in Kok Hoong v. Leong Cheong Kweng Mines Ltd Kok Hoong
v. Leong Cheong Kweng Mines Ltd [1964] AC 993; [1964] MLJ 49, “necessarily
and with precision” determine the point in issue, and he was asked to
indicate to the court how the earlier judgment did necessarily and with
precision determine the liability of the appellants to pay the respondent
for work done for them at their request. He did not do so. We do not,
with respect, see how he could succeed.

[16] Referring to para. 3 in the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Shuhaimi I,
learned counsel submitted that what was directly challenged was s. 4 of the
Sedition Act. The constitutionality of s. 3(3) of the Sedition Act was not
challenged. He contended that the Court of Appeal in Shuhaimi I did not
“necessarily and with precision” determine the issue on the constitutionality
of s. 3(3) of the Sedition Act. He pointed out that in Shuhaimi I, the Court
of Appeal declared s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act to be constitutional.
Referring to paras. 18 to 21 in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, learned
counsel submitted that whilst ss. 4(1), 3(1), and 3(2) of the Sedition Act were
referred to, s. 3(3) of the same Act was never referred to by the court.
Nowhere in the judgment of the Court of Appeal was the issue of intention
being irrelevant as provided under s. 3(3) was mentioned. He submitted that
it is a constitutional requirement that mens rea (intention) shall be an element
of every offence created by law. Contrary to this requirement, s. 3(3) of the
Sedition Act deems intention to be irrelevant. According to learned counsel
it is on this basis that the respondent contends that s. 3(3) of the Sedition Act
is unconstitutional.

[2018] 3 CLJ

[17] Hence, learned counsel submitted that the originating summons is not
vexatious or an abuse of the court process, nor is it governed by res judicata.
On the elements of res judicata, learned counsel relied on Chua Wee Seng
v. Fazal Mohamed [1970] 1 LNS 19; [1971] 1 MLJ 106, where Sharma J held:
To constitute a matter res judicata the following conditions must be
fulfilled:

A

B

1. The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit
or issue must be the same matter which was directly and
substantially in issue either actually or constructively in the former
suit.
2. The former suit must have been a suit between the same parties or
between parties under whom they or any of them claim.

C

3. The parties as aforesaid must have litigated under the same title in
the former suit.
4. The court which decided the former suit must have been a court
competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue
is subsequently raised.
5. The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit
must have been heard and finally decided by the court in the first
suit.

D

E

[18] In this regard, learned counsel argued that except for the fourth
condition, the other conditions for res judicata were not fulfilled.
Our Decision
[19] The Latin term “res judicata” literally translated means ‘a matter
adjudged’. The full maxim is res judicata pro veritate accipitur which means ‘a
matter adjudged is taken as truth’. In explaining what is res judicata, in
Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd v. Kawal Teliti Sdn Bhd [1995] 3 CLJ 783;
[1995] 3 MLJ 189, the Supreme Court said:
What is res judicata? It simply means a matter adjudged, and its
significance lies in its effect of creating an estoppel per rem judicatum. When
a matter between two parties has been adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the parties and their privies are not permitted to
litigate once more the res judicata, because the judgment becomes the truth
between such parties, or in other words, the parties should accept it as the
truth; res judicata pro veritate accipitur. The public policy of the law is that,
it is in the public interest that there should be finality in litigation - interest
rei publicae ut sit finis litium. It is only just that no one ought to be vexed
twice for the same cause of action - nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa.
Both maxims are the rationales for the doctrine of res judicata, but the
earlier maxim has the further elevated status of a question of public policy.
Since a res judicata creates an estoppel per rem judicatum, the doctrine of
res judicata is really the doctrine of estoppel per rem judicatum, the latter
being described sometimes in a rather archaic way as estoppel by record.

Since the two doctrines are the same, it is no longer of any practical
importance to say the res judicata is a rule of procedure and that an
estoppel per rem judicatum is that of evidence. Such dichotomy is apt to
give rise to confusion.
The starting point ought to be the celebrated passage by Wigram VC in
the case of Henderson v. Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 at page 115 which is:
The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to
points upon which the court was actually required by the parties
to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point
which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the
parties, exercising reasonable diligence might have brought forward
at the time.

[20] There are in fact two kinds of estoppel per rem judicatum. The first is
cause of action estoppel and the second is issue estoppel, which is a
development from the first. Explaining on the two types of estoppel, the
court said:
The cause of action estoppel arises when rights or liabilities involving a
particular right to take a particular action in court for a particular remedy
are determined in a final judgment and such right of action, ie the cause
of action, merges into the said final judgment; in layman’s language, the
cause of action has turned into the said final judgment. The said cause
of action may not be relitigated between the same parties because it is
res judicata.
In order to prevent multiplicity of action and also in order to protect the
underlying rationales of estoppel per rem judicatum and not to act against
them, such estoppel of cause of action has been extended to all other
causes of action (based on the same facts or issues) which should have
been litigated or asserted in the original earlier action resulting in the final
judgment, and which were not, either deliberately or due to inadvertence.
... On the other hand, the issue estoppel literally means simply an issue
which a party is estopped from raising in a subsequent proceeding.
However, the issue estoppel, in a nutshell, from a consideration of case
law, means in law a lot more, ie that neither of the same parties or their
privies in a subsequent proceeding is entitled to challenge the correctness
of the decision of a previous final judgment in which they, or their privies,
were parties. This sounds like explaining a truism, but it is the corollary
from that statement that is all important and that could have given birth
to the controversies alluded to above; the corollary being that neither of
such parties will be allowed to adduce evidence or advance any argument
to contradict such decision. In this respect, we respectfully agree with
Peter Gibson J in Lawlor v. Gray [1984] 3 All ER 345 at p 350, who said:
‘Issue estoppel ... prevents contradiction of a previous determination,
whereas cause of action estoppel prevents reassertion of the cause of
action.’
It is important to bear in mind the manner in which the issue estoppel
operates in preventing such contradiction of the previous judgment ...
There is one school of thought that issue estoppel applies only to issues



16

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

actually decided by the court in the previous proceedings and not to issues
which might have been and which were not brought forward, either
deliberately or due to negligence or inadvertence, while another school of
thought holds the contrary view that such issues which might have been
and which were not brought forward as described, though not actually
decided by the court, are still covered by the doctrine of res judicata, ie
doctrine of estoppel per rem judicatum.
We are of the opinion that the aforesaid contrary view is to be preferred;
it represents for one thing, a correct even though broader approach to the
scope of issue estoppel. It is warranted by the weight of authorities to be
illustrated later. It is completely in accord or resonant with the rationales
behind the doctrine of res judicata, in other words, with the doctrine of
estoppel per rem judicatum. It is particularly important to bear in mind the
question of the public policy that there should be finality in litigation in
conjunction with the exploding population; the increasing sophistication
of the populace with the law and with the expanding resources of the
courts being found always one step behind the resulting increase in
litigation.

[21] On the question whether, an estoppel per rem judicatum has to be
pleaded, in holding that it need not, the Supreme Court said:
Another source of small confusion is the rule that generally an estoppel,
of which an estoppel per rem judicatum is a kind, as the name implies, has
to be pleaded. But in Superintendent of Pudu Prison v. Sim Kie Chong [1986]
1 MLJ 494 at p. 498, Abdoolcader SCJ held to the effect that the court
has the inherent jurisdiction to dismiss an action by applying the doctrine
of res judicata against a party even if it has not been pleaded. We venture
to think the reason for the ratio is that an estoppel or exclusion of
evidence based on a question of public policy, ie in this case, the question
of public policy that there should be finality in litigation, is more vigorous
in excluding evidence and need not be pleaded, unlike an ordinary
estoppel which should be pleaded.

[22] The application of the principle of issue estoppel as explained in
Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd (supra) can be seen in many cases, including
the Court of Appeal decision in Dato’ Sivananthan Shanmugam v. Artisan
Fokus Sdn Bhd [2015] 2 CLJ 1062; [2016] 3 MLJ 122. The headnote of the
case reveals the following facts. Lembaga Pembangunan Perumahan dan
Bandar Sabah (‘LPPB’) owned a piece of land (‘the said land’). The appellant
and one Dato’ Paduka Khairuddin Abu Hassan (‘KAH’) negotiated with
LPPB with a view to securing a joint venture agreement (‘the JV agreement’)
between LPPB and the respondent to develop the said land into a housing
project (‘the project’). It resulted in a shareholders’ agreement
(‘the agreement’) entered into by the appellant, KAH, the respondent,
Datuk Hoe Tze Fook (‘HTF’) and Lee Fuei Siong (‘LFS’) both of whom were
the shareholders and directors of the respondent. The agreement was,
expressed to be conditional upon execution of the JV agreement between
LPPB and the respondent. The agreement also contained a stipulation that

if the JV agreement was not executed in the stipulated manner, both the
appellant and KAH were required to refund to the respondent the refundable
deposit forthwith. Following the execution of the agreement, HTF paid
Cosmotine Sdn Bhd (‘Cosmotine’) a sum of RM2.3m being the refundable
deposit. In return, Cosmotine deposited its CIMB Bank Bhd cheque in the
same amount (‘the said cheque’) with HTF. However, the appellant and
KAH failed to secure the JV agreement between LPPB and the respondent
and HTF thereupon presented the said cheque to the bank for payment but
was dishonoured. The respondent demanded the refund of the sum of
RM2.3m from the appellant and KAH. The appellant and KAH failed to
refund the amount. HTF thus commenced an action against Cosmotine (‘the
HTF suit’) for the recovery of the sum of RM2.3m and entered summary
judgment against Cosmotine. The respondent meanwhile, commenced the
present action against the appellant and KAH for the recovery of the sum of
RM2.3m and obtained summary judgment against KAH. With regard to the
action against the appellant, the respondent applied for a question of law to
be determined pursuant to O. 14A of the Rules of Court 2012. The questions
proposed were in the following manner: whether in view of the HTF suit,
the respondent’s cause of action against the appellant was prohibited by the
principle of estoppel, res judicata and doctrine of merger of cause of action.
The learned judge answered the questions posed in the negative and
proceeded to enter judgment against the appellant. In allowing the appellant’s
appeal, the Court of Appeal said:
[25] In the present appeal, since the present action would undoubtedly
involve going over precisely the same facts as in the previous HTF suit,
and accepting the broader approach and the wider sense of res judicata as
the preferred and correct legal position, the fact that the parties to this suit
are different from the HTF suit does not disentitle the appellant to invoke
the doctrine of issue estoppel to bar the respondent from relitigating a
specific issue that had been decided in the prior separate action. The
doctrine also applies to a non-party. It is therefore not necessary for
parties to be the same in both actions. What the doctrine seeks to prevent
is an abuse of the process of the court by attempting to make a double
claim as well as allowing the plaintiff to relitigate its cause for the same
relief and based on the same subject matter for which judgment had
successfully been obtained in the HTF suit and to produce the same set
of facts, the same witnesses and the same documents (see Seruan Gemilang
Makmur Sdn Bhd v. Badan Perhubungan UMNO Pahang Darul Makmur).
[26] We would emphasise at this juncture that the present action could
have been included in the HTF suit by reason of the fact that the relief,
evidence relied on and the witnesses are the same. In truth, the claims
and relief sought in both suits share one common object which is the
refund of RM2.3m from Cosmotine, the appellant and KAH which
amount became liable to be refunded as a result of the alleged breach of
the agreement. The only difference lies in the cause of action. ...



18

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

[28] ... what the respondent had done in effect was to divide its case into
two separate claims and in the process proceed in two stages in order to
suit its convenience while in actuality it was claiming for the same relief
based on the same facts for which judgment had already been obtained
earlier in the HTF suit. It cannot be denied that both claims arose from
the same one and only transaction and were undoubtedly interrelated.
Therefore it would be unjust to permit the respondent to make double
claim by filing two separate actions for the same relief. In our judgment
the instant action is an abuse of the process of the court (see also North
West Water Ltd v. Binnie & Partners (a firm)).
[29] We would further add at this point that, even if there has been no
actual decision as to the issues involved in the instant action, but if the
respondent did not raise these issues in the earlier proceedings which it
could and should have done so, in our view the plea of this doctrine of
res judicata in its amplified and wider sense is available to the appellant to
prevent an abuse of the process of the court. We would refer to the
Supreme Court decision in Superintendent of Pudu Prison & Ors v. Sim Kie
Chon [1986] 1 MLJ 494; [1986] CLJ (Rep) 256:

It would suffice in this regard to refer to the judgment of the Privy
Council in Brisbane City Council and Myer Shopping Centres Pty Ltd v.
Attorney-General for Queensland [1979] AC 411 (at p 425).
The second defence is one of ‘res judicata’. There has, of course,
been no actual decision in litigation between these parties as to
the issue involved in the present case, but the appellants invoke
this defence in its wider sense, according to which a party may
be shut out from raising in a subsequent action an issue which
he could, and should, have raised in earlier proceedings. The
classic statement of this doctrine is contained in the judgment
of Wigram V-C in Henderson v. Henderson [1843] 3 Hare 100 and
its existence has been reaffirmed by this Board in Hoystead v.
Commissioner of Taxation [1926] AC 155. A recent application of
it is to be found in the decision of the Board in Yat Tung
Investment Co Ltd v. Dao Heng Bank Ltd [1975] AC 581. It was, in
the judgment of the Board, there described in these words:
... there is a wider sense in which the doctrine may be
appealed to, so that it becomes an abuse of process to raise
in subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore
should have been litigated in earlier proceedings. The
attempt by way of the instant proceedings to relitigate and
re-open the earlier action clearly reflects the appositeness of
the caption suggested for this matter in the prelude to this
judgment and would appear to us to be as clear an instance
of an abuse of the process of the court ...
[30] The present suit as we have said earlier could have been included in
the HTF suit and the issue in the present case could have been ventilated
there for it to be specifically determined. The respondent chose not to do
so and it is now estopped from coming to the court to seek to raise the

issue which might have been put but was not raised in the HTF suit at
their option (see OCBC Bank (M) Bhd v. Kredin Sdn Bhd [1997] 2 MLJ 544;
[1997] 2 CLJ 534 and Arnold v. National Westminster Bank Plc [1991] 2 AC
93). The plea of res judicata in this appeal is, without question, well taken
and is supported by authority. In the end, we have no hesitation in
accepting it.

[23] It has been said that the principle underlying the doctrine of abuse of
process was applied in Reichel v. Magrath [1889] 14 App Cas 665,
(see Hunter v. Chief Constable of West Midlands and Another [1981] 3 All ER
727). In Reichel v. Magrath, the headnotes of the case reveal the following
facts. The appellant brought an action against his Bishop and the patrons of
a benefice claiming a declaration that he was vicar of the benefice, and that
an instrument of resignation which he had executed was void, and an
injunction to restrain the Bishop from instituting and the patrons from
presenting any other person to the benefice. Judgment was given against the
appellant. Later the respondent, having been duly appointed to the benefice
as the appellant’s successor, brought an action against the appellant claiming
a declaration that the respondent was vicar and a perpetual injunction to
restrain the appellant from depriving the respondent of the use and
occupation of the house and lands. In his statement of defence the appellant
set up the same case as that on which he lost in the action in which he was
plaintiff. The statement of defence was struck out. The House of Lords held,
affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that there was an inherent
jurisdiction in the court to strike out the statement of defence as frivolous and
vexatious and an abuse of the procedure, and to enter judgment for the
plaintiff with a declaration and injunction as claimed. In his judgment, Lord
Halsbury LC said as per p. 668:
My Lords, I think it would be a scandal to the administration of justice
if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant
were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to set up
the same case again. ...

G

H

I

... I believe there must be an inherent jurisdiction in every Court of Justice
to prevent such an abuse of its procedure and I therefore think that this
appeal must likewise be dismissed.

[24] The doctrine of the abuse of the process was attributed to the following
passage in the speech by Sir James Wigram VC in Henderson v. Henderson,
(1843) 3 Hare 100, at pp. 114-115:
I believe I state the rule of the court correctly, when I say, that where a
given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by,
a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that
litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under
special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject
of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward
as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only
because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident,



20

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in specialcase, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the
parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point
which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties,
exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.

A

[25] The passage was approved by the House of Lords in Hoystead & Others
v. Commissioner of Taxation [1926] AC 155, where Lord Shaw delivering the
judgment of the House held:

B

if in any Court of competent jurisdiction a decision is reached, a party is
estopped from questioning it in a new legal proceeding. But the principle
also extends to any point, whether of assumption or admission, which was
in substance the ratio of and fundamental to the decision. The rule on
this subject was set forth in the leading case of Henderson v. Henderson (1)
by Wigram V.C.

[26] Then came Greenhalgh v. Mallard [1947] 2 All ER 255. In that case, the
plaintiff failed in an action for conspiracy to injure (conspiracy for an
unlawful purpose). Later he brought an action on the same facts for
conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Somervell LJ held that the facts in
the case gave rise to only one cause of action for conspiracy:
The present statement of claim admittedly deals with the same
transactions. ...
... Counsel for the plaintiff says that this is a different cause of action. It
is, of course, true that in the authorities dealing with conspiracy it is
pointed out that there are cases in which the conspiracy is unlawful in that
its purpose is unlawful, viz, to injure the plaintiff, in a way which cannot
be justified by any legitimate purpose of the defendants in what they do,
and that in other cases the conspiracy may give rise to a cause of action
because the means used are unlawful. In other words, a conspiracy may
give rise to a claim for damages if either the end or the means, or both,
are wrongful, but, in my opinion, a plaintiff who believes he has a cause
of action in conspiracy must make up his mind whether he is going to rely
on one or other or both of these allegations - whether he is going to say
that the purpose was unlawful, but he does not suggest that the means
are unlawful, or that the means were unlawful, but he does not suggest
that the purpose was unlawful; or that both are unlawful. But if he has
chosen to rely on, and put his case in, one of those ways, he cannot, in
my view, thereafter bring the same transactions before the court and say
that he is relying on a new cause of action.

[27] More importantly, in the context of the doctrine of the abuse of the
process, His Lordship further held that res judicata applied to the later action.
His Lordship also invoked the principle in Henderson:
That, I think, would be enough to dispose of this case, but counsel for
the defendants put his case in two ways, and I will deal with them. He
relied, first, on res judicata, and then said that, if there was any doubt
about that, he was entitled to succeed on the ground that it would be

vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court to allow this
transaction to be brought before the court again on the basis of the
present statement of claim. I think that on the authorities to which I will
refer it would be accurate to say that res judicata for this purpose is not
confined to the issues which the court is actually asked to decide, but that
it covers issues or facts which are so clearly part of the subject-matter of
the litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it would be an
abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started
in respect of them.

[28] In holding so, His Lordship had expanded and indeed amplified the
phrase “every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation” in
Wigram VC’s famous statement in Henderson (see Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd
v. Dao Heng Bank Ltd and Another [1975] AC 581, per Lord Kilbrandon at
p. 590, Asia Commercial Finance, at p. 793).
[29] At this juncture, it is opportune to add that in the Government of
Malaysia v. Dato’ Chong Kok Lim [1973] 1 LNS 35; [1973] 2 MLJ 74, the
wider rule of res judicata as expanded in Henderson which sometimes is
referred to constructive res judicata, was succinctly explained by Sharma J at
p. 76 in the following manner:
The rule is that a matter which might and ought to have been made a
ground of attack or defence becomes a matter which was constructively
in issue. A matter which might and ought to have been made a ground
of attack or defence in the former application but which was not alleged
as such a ground of attack or defence is for the purposes of the plea of
res judicata deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in
issue in the former application, that is to say, though it may not have been
actually directly and substantially in issue it is still regarded as, having
been constructively, directly and substantially in issue. There can be no
distinction between a claim that was actually made and a claim which
might and ought to have been made. The plea of res judicata applies, except
in special cases, not only to points on which the court was actually
required by the parties to form an opinion and to pronounce its judgment
thereupon but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of
litigation and which the parties exercising reasonable diligence might have
brought forward at the time. It is only where the plea which is sought to
be raised in the subsequent proceedings was not available to the party at
the time of the previous proceedings that the decision cannot be
constructively res judicata. The rule of constructive res judicata is really a rule
of estoppel.

[30] The application of the doctrine of the abuse of the process and its
apparent relationship with res judicata can be seen in Hunter v. Chief Constable
of West Midlands and Another (supra). The appellant was one of the six persons
accused of bombing of two public houses in Birmingham. In the criminal
trial, the appellant and the other accused alleged that they had been beaten
up by the police to make them confess and that therefore their confessions
which were heavily relied upon by the Crown was inadmissible. The trial



22

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

judge and the jury found the confessions to be voluntary, and the appellant
and the other accused were convicted. Later, the appellant brought civil
action against the police for damages for assaults causing physical injuries on
him which had been inflicted while he was in police custody. The House of
Lords held that it was an abuse of the process of the court to attempt to
relitigate the same issue, and the civil action was struck out. Lord Diplock
stated at pp. 729, 733-734:
... this is a case about abuse of the process of the High Court. It concerns
the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent
misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with
the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be
manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring
the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.
The circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are very varied;
those which give rise to the instant appeal must surely be unique. It
would, in my view, be most unwise if this House were to use this occasion
to say anything that might be taken as limiting to fixed categories the
kinds of circumstances in which the court has a duty (I disavow the word
discretion) to exercise this salutary power. ...
... The abuse of process which the instant case exemplifies is the initiation
of proceedings in a court of justice for the purpose of mounting a
collateral attack on a final decision against the intending plaintiff which
has been made by another court of competent jurisdiction in previous
proceedings in which the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of
contesting the decision in the court by which it was made. ...
... collateral attack on a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction
may take a variety of forms.

[31] In this regard, Lord Diplock also referred to the following statement
in the speech of Lord Halsbury LC in Reichel v. Magrath (supra):
... I think it would be a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same
question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be
permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to set up the same case
again.

[32] In deciding the case on the basis of the abuse of the process, the House
of Lords declined to endorse Lord Denning’s attempt in the Court of Appeal
to extend issue estoppel to cover the particular instance of the abuse of the
process presented by the case before the court. This is what Lord Diplock
said at p. 732:
Lord Denning MR and Sir George Baker were also in favour of extending
the description ‘issue estoppel’ to cover the particular example of abuse
of process of the court presented by the instant case, a question to which
much of the judgment of Lord Denning MR is addressed. Goff LJ, on
the other hand, expressed his own view, which had been shared by
Cantley J, that such extension would involve a misuse of that expression.

But if what Hunter is seeking to do in initiating this civil action is an abuse
of the process of the court, as I understand all your Lordships are satisfied
that it is, the question whether it also qualifies to bear the label ‘issue
estoppel’ is a matter not of substance but of semantics. Counsel for
Hunter was therefore invited to address this House first on the broader
question of abuse of process and to deal in particular with the reasoning
contained in the judgment of Goff LJ who dealt with the matter more
closely than the other members of the court and based his decision solely
on that ground. In the result, counsel for Hunter, who argued the case
with their accustomed ability and diligence, were quite unable to persuade
any of us that there was any error in the reasoning of Goff LJ in what
proved to be the last judgment that he prepared before his much lamented
and untimely death. In the result it became unnecessary to call on counsel
for the police. So the debate on semantics did not take place. It could not
possibly affect the outcome of the appeal or justify the public expense that
would have been involved in prolonging the hearing any further.

[33] Further Lord Diplock said at p. 733, that in order to avoid confusion,
it would be best “if the use of the description ‘issue estoppel’ in English law
.... were restricted to that species of estoppel per rem judicatam that may arise
in civil actions between the same parties or their privies.”
[34] The doctrine of the abuse of the process was restated by the House of
Lords in Johnson v. Gore Wood & Co (a firm) [2002] 2 AC 1. In his leading
judgment Lord Bingham of Cornhill said:
The rule of law depends upon the existence and availability of courts and
tribunals to which citizens may resort for the determination of differences
between them which they cannot otherwise resolve. Litigants are not
without scrupulous examination of all the circumstances to be denied the
right to bring a genuine subject of litigation before the court: Yat Tung
Investment Co Ltd v. Dao Heng Bank Ltd [1975] AC 581, 590 per Lord
Kilbrandon, giving the advice of the Judicial Committee; Brisbane City Council
v. Attorney General for Queensland [1979] AC 411, 425 per Lord Wilberforce,
giving the advice of the Judicial Committee). This does not however
mean that the court must hear in full and rule on the merits of any claim
or defence which a party to litigation may choose to put forward. For
there is, as Lord Diplock said at the outset of his speech in Hunter v Chief
Constable of the West Midlands Police [1982] AC 529, 536, an inherent power
which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure
in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of
its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to
litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice
into disrepute among right-thinking people. The circumstances in which
abuse of process can arise are very varied; those which give rise to the
instant appeal must surely be unique. It would, in my view, be most
unwise if this House were to use this occasion to say anything that might
be taken as limiting to fixed categories the kinds of circumstances in which
the court has a duty (I disavow the word discretion) to exercise this
salutary power. ...



24

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

[35] Lord Bingham referred to Hunter, and several authorities which
explored the forms of the abuse of the process doctrine which had its root
in Henderson v. Henderson to demonstrate the development of the doctrine in
recent years, at the end of which His Lordship made the following crucial
speech on the issue at p. 31 which contained instructive approach in
considering whether there is an abuse of the process:
But Henderson v. Henderson abuse of process, as now understood, although
separate and distinct from cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, has
much in common with them. The underlying public interest is the same:
that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be
twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the
current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation,
in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of
a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more,
amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party
alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the
earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it
is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional
element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some
dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings
will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding
of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as
unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because
a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been,
so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.
That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion
be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and
private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the
case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the
circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by
seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.
As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one
cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given
facts, abuse is to be found or not. Thus while I would accept that lack
of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier
proceedings an issue which could and should have been raised then, I
would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appears that
the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought
to claim. While the result may often be the same, it is in my view
preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party’s conduct is an
abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to
ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances.
Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has
in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice ...

25

A

[36] Reverting to the present appeal, upon hearing the argument of the
learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) who challenged encl. 1 as an abuse of
the process and on the ground of res judicata, and upon reply by the
respondent’s counsel, the High Court dismissed encl. 1 with costs, having
found it to be an abuse of the process of the court.

B

[37] In its judgment reversing the aforesaid decision of the High Court, the
Court of Appeal approached the appeal under the following issues:

C

(a) whether the appellant (the respondent before us) was precluded by the
doctrine of res judicata from the declaration sought in the originating
summons;
(b) what was the position in law in respect of the test of ‘proportionality’
with reference to the legislative restrictions which might be imposed to
meet the objectives of art. 10(2) of the Federal Constitution; and

D

E

(c) what was the legal effect of s. 3(3) of Act 15 as presently worded and
found in the statute book.
The Court of Appeal next set out the provisions under arts. 8 and 10 of the
Federal Constitution. Then under the heading ‘res judicata issue’, the court
stated that the doctrine of res judicata is not an inflexible rule; that the court
could still decline to apply it where to do so would lead to unjust result, and
that the doctrine is ... “merely equity in action in procedural arena”
(Chee Pok Choy & Ors v. Scotch Leasing Sdn Bhd [2001] 2 CLJ 321, quoting
Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as His Lordship then was), Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung v. Rayner
and Keeler Ltd & Ors (No. 2) [1966] 2 All ER 532, Arnold v. National
Westminster Bank Plc [1991] 2 AC 93). The court then said:

I

From a perusal of the various authorities referred to us it was clear that
section 3(3) of Act 15 had not hitherto before specifically been the subject
of a constitutional challenge in any of those previous proceedings, that
is, on similar lines as mounted in the saman pemula here by the appellant.
This was conceded in as much by learned SFC. The criminal application
questioned the validity of section 4(1)(c) of Act 15 on the grounds that
it unfairly restricted a person’s right to freedom of speech and expression.
There was in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the criminal
application (Mat Shuhaimi bin Shafiei v Public Prosecutor [2014] 2 MLJ 145;
[2014] 5 CLJ 22), a comment with regard to the relevance of the
‘proportionality test’ but this was merely in general terms and with
reference to the purpose of Act 15 and the permissible laws for the
maintenance of public order as allowed under art. 10(2) of the Federal
Constitution.

[38] Reference was then made to the Federal Court’s decision in PP v. Azmi
Sharom [2015] 8 CLJ 921, which according to the Court of Appeal, only
confined its consideration on whether s. 4(1) of Act 15 fell within the scope
of art. 10(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution. Section 3(3) of Act 15 did not
feature at all in the Federal Court’s finding. With regard to PP v. Ooi Kee Said
& Ors [1971] 1 LNS 113; [1971] 2 MLJ 108 and PP v. Param Cumaraswamy

[1986] 1 CLJ 101; [1986] CLJ (Rep) 606; [1986] 1 MLJ 512 referred to by
the learned SFC in support of the submission that s. 3(3) of Act 15 had been
previously considered by our courts and any issue as to its validity had been
put to rest, the Court of Appeal held that apart from being decisions of the
High Court, the two cases were given in the context of criminal charges
unlike in the case before it, where a declaration was being sought in the
originating summons. Further, according to the Court of Appeal, there was
no discussion or assessment by the High Court in those two cases as to the
constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act on the basis of reasonableness or the
‘proportionality principle’ in the context of art. 10(2) of the Federal
Constitution.

A

B

C

[39] The Court of Appeal also held that the High Court was in error in
stating that an “identical question” had been considered and decided by the
courts. This is what the Court of Appeal said:
[23] The learned judge was, in our respectful view, also clearly in error
when stating that an ‘identical question’ had been considered and decided
upon by the courts. That was not so. What was before the court by way
of the saman pemula was a substantive challenge separately brought on
the constitutional validity of s. 3(3) of Act 15 which ought to have been
considered on its merit; the court’s failure to do so had no doubt, resulted
in a miscarriage of justice which warranted our intervention.
[24] It was our view that the appellant ought not to be summarily shut
out of this novel constitutional challenge now mounted which principally
focussed on the validity in law of s 3(3) of Act 15 as tested against the
principle of ‘proportionality’ of any restriction availed of under art. 10(2)(a)
of the FC; the specifics of which had never been adjudicated upon
previously. In any event, it was in the interest of justice, not merely to
the appellant, but also to the public at large, that this issue now been
canvassed be heard and determined by the courts.

[40] The Court of Appeal then proceeded to consider the merits of the
substantive motion and eventually allowed the appeal by the appellant
(the respondent before us), set aside the decision of the High Court, allowed
prayer 1 in the originating summons and made the declaration that s. 3(3) of
the Sedition Act 1948 (Act 15), contravenes art. 10 of the Federal
Constitution and therefore is invalid and of no effect.
[41] For reasons which we will set out shortly, we find that the Court of
Appeal erred in not holding that encl. 1 is an abuse of the process. Indeed,
it is clear that the crucial issue as to whether encl. 1 is an abuse of the process
was not considered at all by the Court of Appeal in its judgment. This must
be done by the Court of Appeal, before embarking on the consideration of
the merits of the motion. If, upon due consideration, encl. 1 is found to be
an abuse of the process, then encl. 1 could not stand, and the appeal must
be dismissed without the need of going to the merits of the substantive

motion. The Court of Appeal had considered the issue of res judicata, but not
the applicability or otherwise of the doctrine of the abuse of the process. On
the law that we have set out at some length, res judicata (in the form of cause
of action estoppel or issue estoppel), is separate and distinct from the doctrine
of abuse of the process although both rest on the same underlying public
interests – namely, that there should be finality in litigation and that a party
should not be vexed twice in the same matter (see Johnson (supra) per
Lord Bingham of Cornhill at p. 31, Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E. Local 79, 2003
SCC 63). The abuse of the process doctrine ... “is untrammelled by the
technicalities of estoppel” (see House of Spring Garden Ltd v. Waite [1990]
2 All ER 990, at 1000). In Bradford and Bingley Building Society v. Seddon
[1999] 1 WLR 1482, at pp. 1490-1491, Auld LJ said:
In my judgment, it is important to distinguish clearly between res judicata
and abuse of process not qualifying as res judicata, a distinction delayed
by the blurring of the two in the courts’ subsequent application of the
above dictum [of Sir James Wigram V-C in Henderson v. Henderson 3 Hare
100]. The former, in its cause of action estoppel form, is an absolute bar
to relitigation, and in its issue estoppel form also, save in ‘special cases’
or ‘special circumstances’: see Thoday v. Thoday [1964] P 181, 197-198, per
Diplock LJ, and Arnold v. National Westminster Bank Plc [1991] 2 AC 93. The
latter, which may arise where there is no cause of action or issue estoppel,
is not subject to the same test, the task of the court being to draw the
balance between the competing claims of one party to put his case before
the court and of the other not to be unjustly hounded given the earlier
history of the matter ... Thus, abuse of process may arise where there has
been no earlier decision capable of amounting to res judicata (either or both
because the parties or the issues are different) for example, where liability
between new parties and/or determination of new issues should have
been resolved in the earlier proceedings. It may also arise where there is
such an inconsistency between the two that it would be unjust to permit
the later one to continue.

[42] The speech by Abdoolcader SCJ in Superintendent of Pudu Prison & Ors
v. Sim Kie Chon [1986] 1 CLJ 548; [1986] CLJ (Rep) 256; [1986] 1 MLJ 494,
at pp. 261-262 (CLJ); pp. 498-499 (MLJ) is also instructive on the
application of the doctrine of the abuse of process:
There is moreover the inherent jurisdiction of the court in cases where
res judicata is not strictly established, and where estoppel per rem judicatam
has not been sufficiently pleaded, or made out, but nevertheless the
circumstances are such as to render any reagitation of the questions
formally adjudicated upon a scandal and an abuse, the court will not
hesitate to dismiss the action, or stay proceedings therein, or strike out
the defence thereto, as the case may require. It would suffice in this regard
to refer to the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by
Lord Wilberforce in Brisbane City Council and Myer Shopping Centres Pty Ltd
v. Attorney-General for Queensland [1979] AC 411, 425.
The second defence is one of ‘res judicata.’ There has, of course,
been no actual decision in litigation between these parties as to the
issue involved in the present case, but the appellants invoke this

[2018] 3 CLJ

defence in its wider sense, according to which a party may be shut
out from raising in a subsequent action an issue which he could,
and should, have raised in earlier proceedings. The classic
statement of this doctrine is contained in the judgment of Wilgram
V-C. in Henderson v. Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 and its existence
has been reaffirmed by this Board in Hoystead v. Commissioner of
Taxation [1926] AC 155. A recent application of it is to be found
in the decision of the Board in Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v. Dao
Heng Bank Ltd [1975] AC 581. It was, in the judgment of the Board,
there described in these words:
... there is a wider sense in which the doctrine may be appealed
to, so that it becomes an abuse of process to raise in
subsequent proceedings matters which could and therefore
should have been litigated in earlier proceedings. (p. 590).
The attempt by way of the instant proceedings to relitigate and reopen
the earlier action clearly reflects the appositeness of the caption suggested
for this matter in the prelude to this judgment and would appear to us
to be as clear an instance of an abuse of the process of the court as one
can find within the connotation thereof enunciated in the speech of Lord
Diplock in Hunter v. Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police & Ors [1982]
AC 529, 542.

[43] So, even if res judicata is not applicable to bar encl. 1, it still cannot
stand if it is found to be an abuse of the process. The question is it an abuse
of the process?.
[44] This brings into focus again the approach on the determination of an
abuse of the process distilled from the speech by Lord Bingham in Johnson
(supra), which we apply. The approach should be:
[a] broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and
private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the
case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the
circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by
seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before"

[45] The ‘merits’ in the phrase ‘broad merits-based judgment’ were not the
substantive merits or otherwise of the actual claim, but those relevant to the
question whether the claimant could or should have brought his claim as part
of the earlier proceeding (see Stuart v. Goldberg Linde [2008] 1 WLR 823, at
840, per Lloyd LJ).

[47] Applying the approach explained in Johnson (supra), we begin
determining whether encl. 1 in the originating summons is an abuse of the
process by examining the notice of motion filed in the criminal proceeding.
In the notice of motion, what the respondent wanted was to have the criminal
prosecution on the charge for an offence under s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15, instituted
against him be struck out and/or set aside and/or quashed (prayer (1)). He
also wanted the court to acquit and discharge him of the said charge
(prayer 2). Those were the purposes. To achieve those purposes, he prayed
for an order that s. 4 of Act 15 be held to be inconsistent with art. 10 of the
Federal Constitution and therefore void. The grounds supporting the
respondent’s application in the notice of motion are as follows:
(i) The charge against the appellant under the Sedition Act is contrary
or not consistent with art. 10 of the Federal Constitution read
together with art. 5 and art. 9 of the Federal Constitution and it is
therefore void and invalid by virtue of art. 4 and/or art. 162 of the
Federal Constitution.
(ii) The Sedition Act does not comply with art. 10 cl. (2)(a) of the
Federal Constitution (which permits law that restricts the freedom
of expression for several objectives) and it cannot objectively be said
to be a reasonable restriction nor does it fulfill the objective in
art. 10 cl. (2)(a) of the Federal Constitution and it is wholly
disproportionate to the valid reason permitted by law to restrict the
fundamental right of the appellant under the Federal Constitution.

[48] The Shah Alam High Court dismissed the motion. The court held that
s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15 is not ultra vires the Federal Constitution. In the Court
of Appeal, learned counsel for the respondent (the appellant before the Court
of Appeal) submitted that:
That s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 (Act 15) read with the definition
of ‘seditious tendency’ in s. 3 of the same Act amounts to an
unreasonable restriction of the appellant’s right to ‘freedom of speech and
expression’ under art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution and that being
the case, s. 4(1)(c) of the same Act is rendered unconstitutional and
should be struck out.

[49] The Court of Appeal held that being a pre Merdeka law, Act 15 is
governed by art. 162 of the Federal Constitution. Section 4(1) of Act was not
caught within the purview of art. 4(1) of the Federal Constitution. Since
Act 15 was enacted in 1948, any application to declare the impugned law
null and void for being inconsistent with art. 4 of the Federal Constitution
must be dismissed and it was grounded on the wrong premise.
[50] The court then considered the provisions under ss. 4(1)(c), 3(1) and
3(2) of Act 15 and art. 10(1)(a) and art. 10(2)(a) and (4) of art. 10. The court
held that the right to freedom of speech and expression under art. 10(1)(a)
of the Federal Constitution is only accorded to the citizens and it is not



30

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

absolute. No one can deny that there must be some restrictions to this right.
Reference was made to several authorities including Madhavan Nair & Anor
v. PP [1975] 1 LNS 94; [1975] 2 MLJ 264, Lau Dak Kee v. PP [1976] 1 LNS
54; [1976] 2 MLJ 229, PP v. Ooi Kee Saik & Ors [1971] 1 LNS 113; [1971]
2 MLJ 108 and Fan Yew Teng v. PP [1975] 1 LNS 38; [1975] 2 MLJ 235.
The court stated that art. 10(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution allows
Parliament to impose “such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient”.
These constitutional restrictions impugned on the freedom of speech and
expression.
[51] The court then said, it is an offence to act, speak, or publish statements
with “seditious tendency” (as provided in s. 2 of Act 15). The prosecution
need not prove that the words were true or otherwise. Then referring to
s. 3(3) of Act, the court said that:
Act throws the net wider in favour of the prosecution. In the present form
under section 3(3) of the Sedition Act, the intention of the maker of the
statements in making those statement is irrelevant. It is also not an
essential ingredient of the offence under section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition
Act for the prosecution to prove that the statements made will incite
[or had incited] violence or public disorder ...
... Based on the authority of PP v. Ooi Kee Saik (supra), the truth of the
statement is also irrelevant.

A

B

C

D

E

[52] It is opportune at this stage to reproduce the submission of learned
counsel for the respondent in the Court of Appeal:
[49] Learned counsel for the appellant complained that a person who
makes a statement which:
F

(a) is not seditious; and
(b) made in good faith with a bona fide intention; or
(c) contains the truth of the matter;
would still be liable to be convicted for sedition under the Sedition Act.

G

[50] Learned counsel for the appellant lamented that the position is
absurd, untenable and unreasonable.
[51] ... the Sedition Act does not distinguish between two categories of
individuals, namely:
(a) those who are genuine in their speech and who speak the truth; and

H

(b) those who are not genuine and who wish to incite hatred and
violence.
[52] ... the sting of the Sedition Act contravened arts. 8 and 10 of the
Federal Constitution following the guidelines of the Federal Court cases
in Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia & Anor [2010] 2 MLJ 333;
[2010] 3 CLJ 507 (FC); and Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor [2009] 5 MLJ
301; [2009] 5 CLJ 631 (FC).

I



[2018] 3 CLJ
A

Kerajaan Malaysia v. Mat Shuhaimi Shafiei

31

[53] ... the crux of the legal challenge centred on s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition
Act which is said to be inconsistent with art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal
Constitution read with the right to equal protection of the law as
encapsulated in art. 8(1) of the Federal Constitution thereby rendering the
said s. 4(1)(c) to be unreasonable and/or disproportionate to the mischief
it seeks to curtail.

B

C

[53] It was argued on behalf of the appellant that whether the Sedition Act
1948 is considered to be a pre-Merdeka law or a post-Merdeka law, the tests
to be applied in a constitutional challenge of the kind as advanced by the
appellant would be the same. It was submitted that the appropriate tests to
be applied would be by way of considering the following questions:
(a) Whether s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 restricts a person’s right to
freedom of speech and expression?

D

E

F

(b) If the question is answered in the affirmative, then the next question to
pose would be whether the restriction is unreasonable and/or
disproportionate to its objective?
(c) Should the answers to both questions be in the affirmative, then the
court is empowered under art. 162(6) and (7) of the Federal Constitution
to repeal the pre-Merdeka legislation which is inconsistent with the
Federal Constitution. The court too, it is said, is empowered under
art. 4(1) of the Federal Constitution to strike down the Sedition Act
1948 if it is considered to be a post-Merdeka law.
[54] The Court of Appeal held that “the Sedition Act is a pre-Merdeka law
...” All pre-Merdeka laws or described as “existing laws” shall continue in
force or after Merdeka day. The court continued:
While Article 162(1) of the Federal Constitution stipulates as follows:
Existing laws

G

162 (1) Subject to the following provisions of this Article and Article 163,
the existing laws shall, until repealed by the authority having power to do
so under this Constitution, continue in force on and after Merdeka Day,
with such modifications as may be made therein under this Article and
subject to any amendments made by federal or State law.
[71] This is followed by art. 162(6) of the Federal Constitution which
states as follows:

H

I

162 (6) Any court or tribunal applying the provision of any existing
law which has not been modified on or after Merdeka Day under
this Article or otherwise may apply it with such modifications as
may be necessary to bring it into accord with the provisions of this
Constitution.



Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

[72] Where there is a conflict between the existing law and the Federal
Constitution, the latter must prevail. This simple proposition of the law
was set by Lord Denning in B Surinder Singh Kanda v. Government of the
Federation of Malaya [1962] 1 MLJ 169 (PC) at p. 172 (MLJ); p. 334 in these
trenchant terms:

A

It appears to Their Lordships that, in view of the conflict between
the existing law (as to the powers of the Commissioner of Police)
and the provisions of the Constitution (as to the duties of the
Police Service Commission) the Yang di-Pertuan Agong could
himself (under art. 162(4)), have made modifications in the existing
law within the first two years after Merdeka Day. (The attention
of Their Lordships was drawn to modifications he had made in the
existing law relating to the railway service and the prison service.)
But the Yang di-Pertuan Agong did not make any modifications
in the powers of the Commissioner of Police, and it is too late for
him now to do so. In these circumstances, Their Lordships think
it is necessary for the court to do so under article 162(6). It appears
to Their Lordships that there cannot, at one and the same time,
be two authorities, each of whom has a concurrent power to
appoint members of the police service. One or other must be
entrusted with the power to appoint. In a conflict of this kind
between the existing law and the Constitution, the Constitution
must prevail. The court must apply the existing law with such
modifications as may be necessary to bring it into accord with the
Constitution. The necessary modification is that since Merdeka
Day it is the Police Service Commission (and not the
Commissioner of Police) which has the power to appoint members
of the police service. And that is just what has happened. The
Police Service Commission has in fact made the appointments.
And Their Lordships are of opinion that they were lawfully made.

B

C

D

E

F

[73] And according to art. 162(7) of the Federal Constitution, the word
‘modification’ includes amendment, adaptation and repeal.

[55] The Court of Appeal then said that in Surinder Singh Kanda (supra), the
Privy Council held that inconsistent existing law must give way to the
Federal Constitution even when an article of the Federal Constitution is
expressed to be “subject to existing laws”. The court observed that there are
a string of authorities that applied art. 162(6) of the Federal Constitution
generously. There are also cases which did not apply art. 162(6) of the
Federal Constitution because the existing laws were found to be consistent
with the Federal Constitution. In this regard, learned counsel for the
respondent submitted that s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act must conform to the
‘reasonable restriction test’ in art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution. It was
submitted that if found to be unreasonable, then this court must make the
necessary modifications under art. 162(6) or 162(7) of the Federal
Constitution and that modifications may include:
(i) a repeal; or
(ii) a declaration of unenforceability; or

33

(iii) an adaptation by adding into the offence the additional elements of
‘intention to threaten or incite violence or public disorder’ (this means
that mere tendency would not suffice to support the offence).
[56] According to the Court of Appeal, the court was urged to hold that
Act 15 is unconstitutional for two main reasons:
(a) that the violation of art. 10(1)(a) and 10(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution
offends the “reasonableness test”
(b) that the violation of the equality provision in art. 8(1) of the Federal
Constitution offends the “proportionality test”.

C

D

E

[57]

On the reasonableness test, the Court of Appeal held:

[90] In considering the ‘reasonableness test’, we took into account the
scheme of the Sedition Act which is all encompassing. It criminalises
speech and expression in different forms. Under the said Act, intention
is irrelevant. As long as the speech or publication had a seditious
tendency, an offence is committed. It is akin to an offence of strict
liability. We reiterate the principles established by Public Prosecutor v. Ooi Kee
Saik & Ors to the effect that the truth or falsity of the words uttered is
immaterial and it is not a defence to a charge for sedition. And whether
the words complained of could have the effect of producing or did in fact
produce any of the consequences listed in s. 3(1)(a) - (f) of the Sedition
Act is immaterial. ...
...

F

G

H

I

[98] Article 4(2)(b) of the Federal Constitution states that the validity of
any law shall not be questioned on the ground that it imposes such
restrictions as are mentioned in art. 10(2) but those restrictions were not
deemed necessary or expedient by Parliament for the purposes mentioned
in that Article. Thus, it clearly ruled out the prerogative of even the courts
to question the validity of those laws that fall within the scope of
art. 10(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution. In this context, it is germane to
refer to the Supreme Court case of Public Prosecutor v. Pung Chen Choon
[1994] 1 MLJ 566, at p. 575, where Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ delivering the
judgment of the Supreme Court aptly said:
So, for example, if the impugned law, in pith and substance, is a
law relating to the subjects enumerated under the permitted
restrictions found in cl. 10(2)(a), the question whether it is
reasonable does not arise; the law would be valid.
[99] In Public Prosecutor v. Param Cumaraswamy (No 2) [1986] 1 MLJ 518,
NH Chan J (later JCA) correctly held the view that the Sedition Act is
constitutional within the purview of art. 10(2) of the Federal Constitution.
At p. 519 of the report, His Lordship had this to say and it is still good
law until today:
In this country, just as in every country, there cannot be absolute
freedom when we speak of fundamental rights (or human rights).
In all common law countries, whether we have the Dicey Rule of



34

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

Law or a Bill of Rights (as in the United States) or a written
constitution, freedom is not an absolute right. Lord Denning calls
it: freedom under the law. This telling phrase was coined by him
in 1949; he was ‘the first and true inventor’ of it: see The Family
Story pp. 177-8.

A

[100] In our judgment, the Sedition Act is constitutional and it does not
violate arts. 10(1)(a) and 10(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution. It does not
offend the reasonableness test. It is reasonable to maintain the Sedition
Act because, ‘The Government has a right to preserve public peace and
order, and therefore, has a good right to prohibit the propagation of
opinions which have a seditious tendency’ (to borrow the words of
His Majesty in Public Prosecutor v. Ooi Kee Saik & Ors).

B

C

[58] In respect of the proportionality test, the Court of Appeal held that
s. 4(1)(c) is constitutional and it passed the proportionality test with flying
colours. The court said:
[101] It is the duty of the court to ascertain whether s. 4(1)(c) of the
Sedition Act is proportionate to the objective it seeks to achieve. This test
of proportionality was enunciated by the Federal Court in Sivarasa Rasiah
(supra).
[102] Statements having ‘seditious tendency’ without regard to the
intention of the maker making those statements and whether the words
expressed are true or otherwise and whether the statements made will
incite violence or public order are all caught within the purview of the
Sedition Act. The proportionality test must be viewed in the context of
the purpose of the Sedition Act, namely the prevention of public disorder
and the maintenance of public order.
[103] The Sedition Act is proportionate to the necessity to safeguard the
security of the federation and to maintain law and order as well as to
avoid incitement. In particular, the impugned provision does not
overreach art. 10(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution and it is substantively
fair and proportionate and thus it does not violate the equality provision
in art. 8(1) of the Federal Constitution. In Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia and
3 Others v. Shri Justice SR Tendoikar and 3 Others AIR 1958 SC 538, the
Indian Supreme Court speaking through Chief Justice SR Das at pp. 547548 held as follows:
(b) that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality
of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show
that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional
principles;
(c) that it must be presumed that the Legislature understands and
correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are
directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its
discriminations are based on adequate grounds;

(e) that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the
Court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge,
matters of common report, the history of the times and may assume
every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of
legislation; and

B

(f) that while good faith and knowledge of the existing conditions on
the part of a Legislature are to be presumed, if there is nothing on
the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances brought to the
notice of the Court on which the classification may reasonably be
regarded as based, the presumption of constitutionality cannot be
carried to the extent of always holding that there must be some
undisclosed and unknown reasons for subjecting certain individuals
or corporations to hostile or discriminating legislation.

In conclusion, the Court of Appeal said that:

We were invited to hold that the Sedition Act be declared null and void.
We declined the invitation ...
D

...

E

[115] In our judgment, the Sedition Act being a pre-Merdeka law is good
law and it is still valid up to this very day. The validity of the
Sedition Act comes under the saving provisions of art. 162 of the
Federal Constitution.
[116] The Sedition Act falls squarely within the framework of art. 10(2)
of the Federal Constitution and its validity and constitutionality
cannot be challenged.

[117] In open court, after anxiously listening to the oral submissions of
the parties, we announced our unanimous decision as follows:
We have deliberated at length and we are of the considered
view that s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act does not infringe the
reasonable test and the proportionality test by virtue of s. 3(2)
of the same Act. Hence, we conclude that s. 4(1)(c) of the same
Act is constitutionally enacted by Parliament and remain a valid
and enforceable law until today. We accordingly dismiss the
appeal and we direct that the appellant is to appear before the
Sessions Court on 5.6.2013 for mention to enable the Sessions
Court Judge to hear the case on its merits.

[60] In encl. 1, the respondent prayed for a declaration that s. 3 of Act 15
read with s. 4 thereof violates art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution, and
is accordingly null and void. The ground given in the originating summons
in support of the application is that s. 3 of Act 15 when read as a whole and
together with s. 4 of the same is upon its true construction inconsistent with
art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution. The brief affidavit filed by the
respondent in support of the application which was stated in the originating
summons to contain the grounds supporting the application, also does not
contain anything material apart from stating that on 7 February 2011, the
respondent was charged in the Sessions Court Shah Alam under s. 4(1)(c) of



36

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

Act 15, and “that ss. 3 and 4 of the Act 15 when read as a whole violate the
fundamental liberty of freedom of speech guaranteed by art. 10(1)(a) of the
Federal Constitution.” No reasons or particulars relating to the alleged
constitutional violation were given. It is only in the written submission by
the respondent’s counsel filed for High Court hearing that the reasons for the
constitutional violation was given, namely, that s. 3 of Act 15 read with
s. 4 of the same is unconstitutional for the following reasons:
(a) Section 3(3) of the Act which makes the offence of sedition one of strict
liability in respect of a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution
in art. 10(1)(a) is incapable of being modified under art. 162 of the
Federal Constitution; and

A

B

C

(b) Section 3 when read as a whole and together with s. 4 of the Act, on its
true construction, renders the freedom of speech guaranteed under
art. 10(1)(a) illusory.
[61] Elaborating on the first reason, it was contended that s. 3(3) of Act 15
renders the offence of sedition a strict liability offence (para. 26, p. 169
appeal record vol. 2(2)). A person exercising a fundamental right guaranteed
by art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution can be guilty of sedition despite
not having the intention to commit such an offence. It is a settled principle
that mens rea is a requirement of all offence - be it under common law or
statute. Section 3(3) of Act 15 cannot be read in accord with the Constitution
because it imposes an absolute bar on the basis of strict liability. Therefore,
the alternative is that s. 3(3) of Act 15 be struck down altogether leaving the
offence of sedition as one requiring intention. In respect of the second reason,
it was contended that Act 15 is not a reasonable restriction on the test
enumerated in Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia & Anor [2010] 3 CLJ
507, because s. 3 of Act 15 read with s. 4 of the same Act failed the test.
The respondent’s challenge pursuant to his application in encl. 1 became
more specific to the constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act 15 as was revealed in
the written submission filed on his behalf in the Court of Appeal. According
to his learned counsel, the question to be decided is whether s. 3(3) of
Act 15, which renders the “intention” irrelevant is in breach of art. 10(2)(a)
and art. 8 of the Federal Constitution. He submitted that, put in another way,
the question is whether s. 3(3) of Act 15 is disproportionate legislative
response, repugnant to the principle of proportionality housed in art. 8, thus
rendering the right to freedom of speech in art. 10(1)(a) illusory (see p. 216,
appeal record, vol. 2(2)). If the restriction is not proportionate it ought to be
struck down as unconstitutional. Then, from the respondent’s skeletal
submission filed for the hearing before us, the gist of the argument on the
challenge to the constitutionality of s. 3(3) is as follows:
... Section 3(3) is unconstitutional because it is absolute in terms and is
therefore a disproportionate legislative response. It would not have been
disproportionate had s. 3(3) included a mental element. This is because
there is a right vested by the common law of England in every accused

[62] So, actually of the constitutional challenge in encl. 1 is the
constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act 15, under which intention is deemed to be
irrelevant for the purpose of proving the commission of any offence against
Act 15. However, for that purpose, s. 3(3) cannot stand and be taken alone.
This is because of the interplay between s. 4 (in particular s. 4(1)(c), in the
context of the charge against the respondent), s. 2 and ss. 3(1), 3(2) and 3(3)
of Act 15. On the scheme of Act 15 as it stands, in considering whether the
offence under s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15 is made out, that section must be considered
with ss. 2 and 3 of Act 15. In order to establish the charge against the
respondent under s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15, the prosecution has to prove the act
of publishing a seditious publication.
Section 4(1) of Act 15 provides:

Offences
4. (1) Any person who:
(a) does or attempts to do, or makes any preparation to do, or
conspires with any person to do, any act which has or which
would, if done, have a seditious tendency;

G

(b) utters any seditious words;
(c) prints, publishes, sells, offers for sale, distributes or reproduces
any seditious publication; or

H

I

37

that that mens rea shall be an element of every offence created by law. ...
This right is to be found within art. 5(1) through the interpretive process
of reading art. 160(2) with section 66 of Part II of the Consolidated
Interpretations Acts 1948 and 1967, whereby a right at common law
becomes a right protected by Article 5(1). ... Section 3(3) cannot be saved
under Article 162 because it cannot be brought to accord with the
Constitution. It cuts across or renders the right under Article 10(1)(a)
illusory being a disproportionate law. ... Under Article 162(6) the Court
may modify and perform a legislative function. That would mean
re-writing the subsection by deleting the words “deemed to be irrelevant”
and inserting the word “relevant” after the words “shall be”. The other
way to modify it is for Court to delete the whole subsection acting under
Article 162(6) read with (7). The result will be the same because intention
will become relevant. And that is all that the Constitution requires.

be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the court directs.

[64] The answer to the question as to what is a seditious publication is
found under s. 2 of Act 15. Section 2 provides as follows:

A

“seditious” when applied to or used in respect of any act, speech, words,
publication or other thing qualifies the act, speech, words, publication or
other thing as one having a seditious tendency;

[65] In order to prove a “seditious tendency”, the prosecution has to rely
on s. 3(1) of Act 15 which provides:

B

Seditious tendency
3. (1) A “seditious tendency” is a tendency:
(a) to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against
any Ruler or against any Government;
(b) to excite the subjects of
territory governed by any
the territory of the Ruler
alteration, otherwise than
law established;

any Ruler or the inhabitants of any
Government to attempt to procure in
or governed by the Government, the
by lawful means, of any matter as by

C

D

(c) to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against
the administration of justice in Malaysia or in any State;
(d) to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the subjects of the
Yang di-Pertuan Agong or of the Ruler of any State or amongst
the inhabitants of Malaysia or of any State;

E

(e) to promote feelings of ill will and hostility between different
races or classes of the population of Malaysia; or
(f) to question any matter, right, status, position, privilege,
sovereignty or prerogative established or protected by the
provisions of Part III of the Federal Constitution or Article 152,
153 or 181 of the Federal Constitution.

[66] In the context of the charge against the respondent, the tendency under
s. 3(1)(a) and the tendency under s. 3(1)(d) are relevant.
[67] In considering whether any act, speech, words, publication or other
thing has any seditious tendency under s. 3(1), regard must be had to the
exception under s. 3(2) of Act 15 which provides that an act, speech, words,
publication or other thing shall not be deemed to be seditious by reason only
that it has a tendency provided under ss. 3(2)(a), 3(2)(b), and 3(2)(c) of the
same Act.
[68] For the purpose of proving the commission of an offence under
s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15, (or indeed any offence under the Act), s. 3(3) of the Act
must come into play because once the elements under s. 3(1) read with s. 2
of Act are established, namely, that the publication published by the

A

B

Kerajaan Malaysia v. Mat Shuhaimi Shafiei

39

respondent in fact had a seditious tendency, then the intention of the
respondent shall be deemed to be irrelevant. This is clear from s. 3(3) of
Act 15 which provides:
(3) For the purpose of proving the commission of any offence against this
Act the intention of the person charged at the time he did or attempted
to do or made any preparation to do or conspired with any person to do
any act or uttered any seditious words or printed, published, sold, offered
for sale, distributed, reproduced or imported any publication or did any
other thing shall be deemed to be irrelevant if in fact the act had, or
would, if done, have had, or the words, publication or thing had a
seditious tendency.

[69] In other words, once it is proven that the publication published by the
respondent had a seditious tendency as provided under s. 3(1) by Act 15, read
with s. 2 of Act 15, the offence under s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15 against the
respondent will be established, and by virtue of s. 3(3), the respondent’s
intention of publishing the publication shall be deemed irrelevant. The
deeming of the intention of the person charged as being irrelevant in s. 3(3)
of Act 15 is the target of the respondent’s challenge on the constitutionality
of that section. Because of the interplay between ss. 4(1)(c), 2, 3(1), 3(2) and
3(3) of Act, bearing in mind the criminal charge preferred, in the criminal
proceeding, when the respondent challenged the constitutionality of s. 4(1)
of Act 15 for the purpose of the impugning the charge, he could not leave
out the constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act 15 which deems intention to be
irrelevant once seditious tendency is proven as explained in s. 2 read with
s. 3. In fact s. 3 of Act 15 was referred to by learned counsel for the
respondent in Shuhaimi I. As would be recalled, in Shuhaimi I, in raising the
main point raised in the Court of Appeal, he submitted that “s. 4(1)(c) of Act
15 read with the definition of “seditious tendency” in s. 3 of the same Act
amounts to an unreasonable restriction” to the respondent’s right of freedom
of speech and expression under art. 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution, and
hence s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15 is rendered unconstitutional and should be struck
out. He must have in mind s. 3(2) of Act 15 which explains “seditious
tendency”. However, he fell short of s. 3(3). He should have raised the
constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act 15. In our view, considered in the context
we have explained, the constitutionality of s. 3(3) of Act 15 is clearly part
of the subject of the litigation in the notice of motion in the criminal
proceeding and so clearly could have been raised therein. The respondent
should have challenged the constitutionality of s. 3(3) in the notice of motion
in the criminal proceeding. There is nothing in the affidavit filed in support
of encl. 1 in the notice of motion to explain why this issue was not raised
in the criminal proceeding. There is also nothing akin to fresh evidence
which might warrant the raising of this issue only in encl. 1. Having
considered all the circumstances, we hold that encl. 1 is an abuse of the



40

Current Law Journal

[2018] 3 CLJ

process. On this ground alone encl. 1 should be dismissed. Thus, the Court
of Appeal erred in allowing the respondent’s appeal and in considering the
merits of the application in encl. 1. In our view, this clearly warrants our
interference.
[70] We come now to the contention of learned counsel for the respondent
that the doctrine of res judicata had no application to a challenge upon the
constitutionality of a statute. In support of his argument he referred to the
following passage in the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in
Nand Kishore v. State of Punjab [1995] 6 SCC 614:
18. Bearing the above principles in mind what at best was said by the State
of Punjab was that failure to raise the constitutionality of Rule 5.32 in the
writ petition preferred by the appellant would imply, on the principle of
“might and ought”, that the opportunity of controverting the matter had
been lost and that it should on the principles of constructive res judicata
be taken that the matter had been actually raised and adversely decided.
But in Forward Construction Co. and Others. v. Prabhat Mandal and Others
[1986(1) SCC 100], this Court has taken the view that where a matter has
been constructive in issue it cannot be said to have been actually heard
and decided. It could only be deemed to have been heard and decided.
19. It would then have to be seen the twin play of the notion of deemed
constitutionality and bar of constructive res judicata. Raising the
constitutionality of a provision of law, as it appears to us, stands on a
different footing than raising a matter on a bare question of law, or mixed
question of law and fact, or on fact. There is a presumption always in
favour of constitutionality of the law. The onus is heavy on the person
challenging it. It is by the discharge of onus that the presumption of
constitutionality can be crossed over. When a person enters a Court for
relief and does not challenge the constitutionality of the law governing
the matters directly and substantially in issue, it only means and implies
that he goes by the presumption of constitutionality. He cannot on this
stance be deemed to have raised the question of constitutionality and the
question of constitutionality to have been decided against him and such
matter to have been directly and substantially in issue. The
constitutionality of the Rule relating to compulsory retirement cannot be
deemed to have been questioned and decided against the appellant on the
principles of “might and ought” or it being “directly and substantially in
issue”. It cannot be taken as a rule that one of the pleas, either by the
plaintiff or the defendant, in every suit or proceeding, must of necessity
relate to the constitutionality of the law on which the cause is founded
or defended in order to obviate the plea of constructive res judicata being
raised in an eventuality. It cannot also be taken as a rule that
constitutionality of the law involved is a matter directly and substantially
in issue, and if not raised renders a mute decision in favour of its
constitutionality barring the plea being raised in a subsequent suit. If there
be read such a rule in all civil litigation, it would, to our mind, be against
public policy vexing and burdening the courts to go into the
constitutionality of provisions of law in every case. When under the

impugned rule, the Government assumed to itself the power to
compulsorily retire a permanent government servant after ten years of
qualifying service, the court’s act of striking that Rule as unconstitutional
is the law which appeared on the scene, not only to break the presumption
of constitutionality but to declare it void. In a sense the offending
provision was never there and in the other it was henceforth not there.
In either event, it would be within the ambit of the emphasised words in
Mathura Prasad’s case.

[71] According to learned counsel, only the point which was raised and
challenged was deemed raised. The other presumptions which were not
raised were deemed constitutional. For that reason he argued, constructive
res judicata did not apply. We are unable to agree.
[72] We do not subscribe to the view that the doctrine of res judicata does
not apply to a challenge upon the constitutionality of a statute. The basis on
which the doctrine of res judicata rests is founded on the consideration of
public policy that it is in the public interest that there should be finality in
litigation and decisions made by courts of competent jurisdiction, and that
no one should be vexed twice for the same kind of litigation. Therefore, we
see no reason why the doctrine of constructive res judicata should not apply
to a challenge on the constitutionality of a statute. To support this, we refer
to the decision of the Supreme Court of India in State of Haryana v. State of
Punjab and Anor [2004] 12 SCC 673. In this case the State of Punjab was
barred by res judicata in a later action from challenging the constitutionality
of a statute which it could have challenged in an earlier action but did not
do so. To demonstrate the point we will set out the essential facts derived
from the judgment of the Supreme Court. The case concerns the SutlejYamuna Link Canal Project covering about 214 km. Following the creation
of the State of Haryana from the erstwhile State of Punjab, question arose as
to apportionment of the river waters made available to the erstwhile State of
Punjab between Haryana and Punjab. On 24 March 1976, a notification was
issued by the Union of India under s. 78 of the Punjab Reorganisation Act
1966, inter alia dividing the river waters between the two states. Out of the
214 km, 122 km were to run through the territory of Punjab and 92 km
through Haryana. The cost of the project was to be borne by the Central
Government. Haryana’s portion was completed by June 1980. The State of
Punjab had not completed its share of the canal although it had been paid the
amount necessary for the purpose. In 1979, the State of Haryana filed Suit
No. 1 of 1976 seeking completion of the project. The State of Punjab filed
Suit No. 2 of 1979 challenging among other things, s. 78 of the Punjab
Reorganisation Act and the notification dated 24 March 1976. During the
pendency of the suits, on 31 December 1981, an agreement was made
between the States of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. The agreement
provided that the project would be implemented within specified time frame.
The canal works in the Punjab territory was to be completed within a period



Current Law Journal

42

[2018] 3 CLJ

of two years from the date of the agreement. Following the agreement, on
12 February 1981, the Supreme Court allowed the suits to be withdrawn. On
the expiry of the period for the completion of the project by Punjab, its
portion of the agreement remained not completed. On 24 July 1985, a
settlement (the Punjab Settlement) was reached between Haryana and Punjab.
Clause 9 of the settlement provides:

A

B

9. Sharing of river waters
9.1. The farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan will continue
to get water not less than what they are using from the Ravi-Beas
system as on 1.7.1985; waters used for consumptive purposes will
also remain unaffected. Quantum of usage claimed shall be
verified by the Tribunal referred to in para 9.2. below.
9.2. The claims of Punjab and Haryana regarding the shares in their
remaining waters will be referred for adjudication to a tribunal to
be presided over by a Supreme Court Judge. The decision of this
Tribunal will be rendered within six months and would be binding
on both parties. All legal and constitutional steps required in this
respect be taken expeditiously.

C

D

9.3. The construction of SYL Canal shall continue. The canal shall
be completed by 15.8.1986.

[73] Pursuant to cls. 9.1 and 9.2 of the settlement, s. 14 was added to the
Inter-State Water Disputes Act 1956. Issues regarding usage, share and
allocation of the Ravi-Beas waters were referred to the adjudication by the
Union of India under notification dated 2 April 1986. On 30 January 1987,
the Tribunal submitted its report, inter alia allocating the Ravi-Beas waters
between Punjab and Haryana. Pursuant to cl. 9.3 of the settlement which
continued to operate, Punjab completed about 90% of the construction of the
canal. However, 10% of the construction remained not completed. Haryana
filed Suit No. 6 of 1996 praying for:
(a) a decree declaring that the order dated 24.3.1976, the agreement of
31.12.1981 and the settlement of 24.7.1985 are final and binding
inter alia on the State of Punjab casting an obligation on Defendant
No. 1 to immediately restart and complete the portion of the SutjejYamuna Link Canal Project as also make it usable in all respects,
not only under the aforesaid order of 1976, agreement of 1981 and
settlement of 1985 but also pursuant to a contract established by
conduct from 1976 till date.
(b) a decree of mandatory injunction compelling Defendant 1 (failing
which Defendant 2 by or through any agency) to discharge its/their
obligations under the said notification of 1976, the agreement of
1981 and the settlement of 1985 and in any case under contract
established by conduct, by immediately restarting and completing
that portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal Project in the State

of Punjab and otherwise making it suitable for use within a time
bound manner as may be stipulated by this Hon’ble Court to enable
the State of Haryana to receive its share of Ravi and Beas waters.

[74] The State of Punjab filed a written statement questioning the
jurisdiction of the court under art. 262 of the Constitution and that the suit
was barred under O. 23 r. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under
O. 32 r. 2 of the Supreme Court Rules 1966. On 15 January 2002, the
Supreme Court decreed the suit in favour of Haryana and issued a mandatory
injunction directing the State of Punjab to complete the construction of the
canal and make it functional within one year. The State of Punjab did not
comply with the court’s decree. On 18 December 2002, Haryana filed an
application (IA No. 1 of 2002 in Suit No. 6 of 1996), to implement the
judgment and decree dated 15 January 2002.
[75] On 13 January 2003, the State of Punjab filed Suit No. 1 of 2003
praying for several reliefs which include:

D

(c) To declare that Section 14 of the Act, 1956 is ultra-vires the
Constitution of India;
(d) To declare that Section 14 of the Act 1956 is no longer enforceable
for the reasons set out in the plaint.

E

(e) To declare that the Punjab Settlement (Rajiv-Longowal Accord) is
not enforceable under the changed circumstances as set out in the
plaint.

F

[76] In response, Haryana filed an application (IA in OS No. 1 of 2003)
for rejection of the plaint; alternatively for summary dismissal of the suit
under O. 23 r. 6 read with O. 47 r. 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 1966.

G

[77] The court proceeded to consider Haryana’s application in IA in OS
No. 1 of 2003 first because its outcome would decide the fate of Punjab’s
application challenging the decree dated 15 January 2002 (OS No. 1 of 2003)
and Haryana’s application for enforcement of the decree dated 15 January
2002.

H

[78] In challenging suit no. 1 of 2003, filed by Punjab, Haryana, inter alia,
submitted that prayers (c) to (f) in that suit were barred by res judicata. Prayer
(c) is the prayer to declare that s. 14 of the Act 1956 is ultra vires the
Constitution of India. In its judgment, the Supreme Court said at pp. 701,
703 and 704:
67. Can the State of Punjab raise these issues again? Or is it barred by
the principles of res judicata assuming that the principles of res judicata are
‘law’ within the meaning of Order 26 Rule 6(b)?

I

68. The doctrine of res judicata and Order 32 Rule 2 are not technical rules
of procedure and are fundamental to the administration of justice in all
courts that there must be an end of litigation. Thus, when this Court was
called upon in Daryao v. State of U.P., to hold that res judicata could not



Current Law Journal

44

[2018] 3 CLJ

apply in connection with proceedings before this Court under Article 32
because of the extraordinary nature of the jurisdiction, it was said:
(AIR pp. 1461-62, para 9)
9. But, is the rule of res judicata merely a technical rule or is it based
on high public policy? If the rule of res judicata itself embodies a
principle of public policy which in turn is an essential part of the
rule of law then the objection that the rule cannot be invoked
where fundamental rights are in question may lose much of its
validity. Now, the rule of res judicata as indicated in Section 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure has no doubt some technical aspects,
for instance the rule of constructive res judicata may be said to be
technical; but the basis on which the said rule rests is founded on
considerations of public policy. It is in the interest of the public at
large that a finality should attach to the binding decisions
pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction, and it is also in
the public interest that individuals should not be vexed twice over
with the same kind of litigation. If these two principles form the
foundation of the general rule of res judicata they cannot be treated
as irrelevant or inadmissible even in dealing with fundamental
rights in petitions filed under Article 32.
The binding character of judgments pronounced by courts of
competent jurisdiction is itself an essential part of the rule of law,
and the rule of law obviously is the basis of the administration of
justice on which the Constitution lays so much emphasis ...

A

B

C

D

E

...
71. Since the doctrine of res judicata is an “essential part of the rule of law”,
it follows that if the issues raised in the suit are barred by res judicata ex
facie then this Court is required to reject the plaint in terms of Order 32
Rule 6(b). ...

F

78. Similarly the challenge to Section 14 of the 1956 Act must be ejected
at the threshold. The section reads:
14. Constitution of Ravi and Beas Waters Tribunal.
G

(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing
provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, by
notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a Tribunal

Kerajaan Malaysia v. Mat Shuhaimi Shafiei

far as may be, but subject to sub-section (3) hereof, apply to
the constitution, jurisdiction, powers, authority and bar of
jurisdiction in relation to the Tribunal constituted under
sub-section (1).
(3) When a Tribunal has been constituted under sub-section (1),
the Central Government alone may suo motu or at the request
of the State Government concerned refer the matters
specified in paragraphs 9.1, and 9.2 of the Punjab Settlement
to such Tribunal.
Explanation - For the purpose of this section ‘Punjab
Settlement’ means the Memorandum of Settlement signed at
New Delhi on the 24th day of July, 1985.
79. In paragraph 51 of Punjab’s written statement in OS No. 6 of 1996,
it was admitted that the issues referred to in paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2 of
the Punjab Settlement were referred to the Ravi-Beas Tribunal by
Government notification dated 2.4.1986 and the affirmation of the
continued availability of water from the Ravi-Beas system as on 1.7.1985
referred to in the notification was relied upon. The notification dated
2.4.1986 was issued under Section 14 of the Inter-States Water Disputes
Act. As far as the report of the Tribunal is concerned, paragraph 8 of the
written statement says that it could not be relied upon because it had not
become final and that Punjab did not accept the correctness of “most of
its findings”. There was no dispute raised as to the constitutionality of
Section 14 at any stage. Even in the course of arguments, when Section
14 was specifically referred to in elaborate written notes on the scope,
purport and effect of Section 14, it was submitted that the effect of
Section 14 is fourfold:
(A) To overcome procedural hurdles that no dispute had been
raised and to bypass the mandatory requirement of
negotiations.
(B) To deem matters referred under Section 14 to be a “water
dispute” and place this beyond challenge.

G

(C) To constitute this special Section 14 Tribunal under this Act and
not any other provision or statute and make the other
provisions applicable.
(D) To oust the jurisdiction of all courts including the Supreme
Court by making Section 11 applicable to this dispute.

H

I

(E) To leave all other disputes relating to the Punjab Settlement to
be decided under the amended Act of 1956.
80. This Court in the judgment dated 15.1.2002 considered the arguments
of the parties relating to Section 14 and negatived Punjab’s submission as
to the construction of Section 14. Punjab could have challenged the
constitutional validity of Section 14 in its written statement. It did not
then. It cannot do so now being barred by the doctrine of res judicata.

Conclusion
[79] What we have decided thus far is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.
We conclude that encl. 1 is an abuse of the process. As such encl. 1 should
be dismissed without the need to consider the merits of the application. In
the circumstances we find it unnecessary to answer the first and the second
leave questions as framed.

B

[80] In view of our finding that encl. 1 is an abuse of the process as
aforesaid, there is also no necessity for this court to consider the third leave
question.
[81] In the upshot, the appeal is allowed. The decision of the Court of
Appeal in respect of encl. 1 is set aside. The decision of the High Court in
respect of encl. 1 is reinstated.
[82] We order that the trial of the respondent in respect of the charge under
s. 4(1)(c) of Act 15 in Shah Alam Sessions Court to proceed. The respondent
is to appear before the Shah Alam Sessions Court for mention on 10 January
2018 to fix the trial date.
