HIGH COURT MALAYA, KUALA LUMPUR
MOHD SOFIAN ABD RAZAK J
[CRIMINAL APPEAL NO: 42(S)-68-06-2016 & 42(H)-80-06-2016]
12 OCTOBER 2018
B

CRIMINAL LAW: Sedition Act 1948 – Section 4(1)(c) – Publication of seditious
photograph of couple eating Bak Kut Teh with heading ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa’
and containing logo ‘Halal’ – Whether accused and another had common intention
to upload impugned greetings on Facebook – Whether publication had any
tendency to raise discontent or disaffection amongst inhabitants of Malaysia –
Whether publication had tendency to promote feelings of ill will or hostility between
different races or classes
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE: Sentence – Appeal against – Accused sentenced to
imprisonment term of five months and 22 days for offence under s. 4(1)(c) of Sedition
Act 1948 – Whether there was inadequacy of sentence – Whether deterrent enough
to prevent similar offence being committed – Accused a first offender – Whether
appropriate to set aside imprisonment sentence and substituting it with fine
This was the appellant’s appeal against the decision of the Sessions Court
Judge (‘SCJ’) whereby the appellant was found guilty for an offence under
s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 (‘Sedition Act’) and sentenced to an
imprisonment term of five months and 22 days. The prosecution cross
appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence. It was the prosecution’s case
that the appellant had published a seditious publication on a Facebook page
known as ‘Alvin and Vivian – Alvivi’) at 9am on 12 July 2013 in an
apartment in Kuala Lumpur. The alleged seditious photograph was with the
heading ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa (dengan Bak Kut Teh … wangi, enak,
menyelerakan!!)’ and containing the logo ‘Halal’. The issues that arose were
(i) the charge under s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act and the charge under
s. 5(1) of the Film Censorship Act 2002 were jointly tried thus it was argued
whether the factual matrix of the two charges differed materially and they did
not fulfil the requirement under s. 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code
(‘CPC’) or s. 163 of the CPC; (ii) whether the prosecution proved that there
was a publication on the Facebook page within the meaning of s. 2 of the
Sedition Act and whether there was any evidence that the Facebook greeting
was published or uploaded by the appellant and one Tan Jye Yee (‘Tan’)
who had since absconded and was not present in court; (iii) whether the
Facebook publication had any tendency to raise any discontent or
disaffection amongst the subjects of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the
inhabitants of Malaysia or had any tendency to promote feelings of ill will
or hostility between the different races or classes of population in Malaysia
and (iv) whether the term of imprisonment meted out on the appellant was
deterrent enough to prevent similar offence being committed by others.

Lee May Ling v. PP & Another Appeal

743

Held (dismissing appeal on conviction; substituting sentence of
imprisonment with a fine in the sum of RM5,000):
(1) Even if the two charges were wrongly heard jointly, so long as the
appellant was not prejudiced by the conduct of the case, the court could
invoke the provision of s. 422 of the CPC in that if the joint trial was
irregular, it did not vitiate the trial unless such irregularity had
occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Herein, the court failed to see that
it had occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The appellant was not misled
by having the two charges heard together. (para 7)
(2) Although no one actually saw the appellant or Tan publish or upload the
Facebook greeting but from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses
all pointed to the fact that the photographs were kept in the file ‘Bak Kut
Teh png’ in the notebook Samsung belonging to Tan and the Facebook
account were registered in the appellant’s and Tan’s names. The
necessary inference which could be drawn from the evidence was that
the publication was done by Tan and the appellant and the photographs
showed both Tan and the appellant together in the photo. There was no
evidence to suggest that the notebook Samsung was used by others.
Further, there was sufficient evidence to prove the appellant and Tan
had the common intention to publish or upload the impugned Facebook
greetings. (paras 12 & 14)
(3) There was evidence that the publication had caused feelings of ill will
or hostility between the different races or classes of population in
Malaysia. This was evident from the testimonies of SP2, SP3, SP4, SP8
and SP12 who expressed their anger, frustration, hurt and regret on the
action by the appellant and Tan. The publication on Facebook had a
seditious tendency. (paras 20 & 21)
(4) The SCJ had considered the correct principles of law based on the
testimonies of the prosecution and the defence witnesses and hence no
appellate intervention on conviction was necessary. The court affirmed
the decision on conviction by the SCJ. (para 24)
(5) An appropriate sentence to be meted out on the appellant would be to
impose a maximum fine of RM5,000 taking into account that the
appellant was a first offender as far as the charge was concerned. It
would be more appropriate to sentence the appellant to an imprisonment
sentence if she committed a subsequent offence. Furthermore, Tan, the
co-accused in the charge had absconded while the appellant appeared in
court to answer the charge. In this respect, the court would tamper
justice with mercy by setting aside the imprisonment sentence and
substituting it with a maximum fine of RM5,000 in default six months’
imprisonment. The appeal on sentence by prosecution was therefore
dismissed. (para 26)

[3]
On 10 April 2018, the court heard the appeal and after perusing the
appeal record and reading the written submissions and hearing further oral
submissions from both parties, dismissed the appeal on conviction but
substituted the sentence of five months and 22 days imprisonment with a fine
in the sum of RM5,000 in default, imprisonment of six months. The court
in the same vein dismissed the prosecution’s appeal on inadequacy of
sentence. Both the parties were disenchanted with the said decision and have
since filed respective notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal against
conviction and sentence.
Observation By The Court

[4]
The court observed that the appeal was against the amended charge
pursuant to s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 and read together with s. 34
of the Penal Code. Initially, the appellant was jointly charged with another
co-accused, named Tan Jye Yee, however in the midst of the trial when the
case was adjourned and then resumed, Tan Jye Yee had absconded. The trial
resumed in the absence of Tan Jye Yee. Until the conclusion of the trial, Tan
Jye Yee was absent. The court found that the notice of appeal by the
appellant was against conviction and sentence whereas the appeal by the
prosecution was against adequacy of sentence. Both appeals were for the
charge pursuant s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 and not against s. 5(1)
Film Censorship Act 2002. The learned SCJ nevertheless in his judgment at
pp. 63-64 of the appeal record vol. 1 had discussed the ingredients of the
offence under s. 5(1) of the Film Censorship Act 2002 which was not
relevant. The learned SCJ need not discussed the ingredients of the offence
under s. 5(1) of the Act since there was no appeal by the prosecution against
the acquittal and discharged of the appellant at the end of the prosecution’s
case.
[5]
One of the many issues raised by the counsel in this appeal, was the
fact that the charge under s. 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act and the charge under
s. 5(1) of the Film Censorship Act were jointly tried. The learned counsel
argued that the factual matrix of the two charges differed materially and they
did not fulfil the requirement under s. 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code
(hereinafter called the ‘CPC’) or s. 163 of CPC.
[6]
The prosecution in its submission did not touch on this issue at all and
for the learned SCJ, it was stated that the order for the joint trial of the two
charges was made by the previous learned SCJ and the learned SCJ who
heard the matter as they were based on the decision of the earlier ruling made
by the previous SCJ to have the two charges tried together.

[7]
The court was of the view that even if the two charges were wrongly
heard jointly, so long as the appellant was not prejudiced by the conduct of
the case, the court could invoke the provision of s. 422 of CPC in that if the
joint trial was irregular, it did not vitiate the trial unless such irregularity has
occasioned a miscarriage of justice. In the instant case, the court failed to see
that it has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The appellant was represented
by counsel and the appellant was not misled by having the two charges heard
together.
[8]
The argument by the learned counsel was on the charge itself. The
learned counsel submitted that the prosecution’s case was that the appellant
had published a seditious publication on a Facebook page known as ‘Alvin
and Vivian-Alvivi’ at the address http//www facebook.com/
php?fbid=617457598272144&set=a5128606
42065174.123291.509820495702522&type=1& theatre at 9am on 12 July
2013 in an apartment known as 568-14-18, Kompleks Mutiara, Jalan 1poh,
Batu 31/2, 51200, Kuala Lumpur. The alleged seditious photograph was a
photograph with heading ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa (dengan Bak Kut The ...
wangi, enak, menyelerakan!! and containing the logo ‘Halal’ as well as the
words underlined by the prosecution in the Annexure to the charge which
were as follows:
Selamat Berbuka Puasa (dengan Bak Kut Teh ... wangi, enak,
menyelerakan!!’[ http//www.alvivi.tv Izinkan kami memperkenalkan cara
kami memupuk semangat 1Malaysia dengan bertukar-tukar makanan
antara kaum-kaum Malaysia pada musim perayaan yang mulia ini. Hak
untuk menikmati juadah enak ternpatan seharusnya merentasi batasan
bangsa dan juga agama. Kepada saudara-saudari yang beragama Islam,
selamat berbuka puasa dan Salam Aidilfitri.

[9]
The learned counsel submitted that the prosecution has to prove that
there has been a publication on the Facebook page entitled ‘Alvin and
Vivian-Alviv’ on the morning of 12 July 2013 and the learned counsel
conceded that there was a publication on the Facebook page within the
meaning of s. 2 of the Sedition Act 1948.

[10] As to the second element of the offence, the learned counsel submitted
that there was no evidence that the Facebook greeting was published or
uploaded by the appellant or by Tan Jye Yee.
[11] The court has perused the evidence of SP9 who testified that the
photographs were recovered from Samsung laptop (exh. 19) belonging to Tan
Jye Yee. The learned counsel said there was no evidence that the photograph
was uploaded or published by Tan Jye Yee. From the evidence SP12 (the
complainant) who was attached to the Bahagian Kandungan Komunikasi dan
Perkhidmatan Post and conducted a surveillance on website. He saw through
his computer a Facebook alvivi.swinger showing two individuals with the

words ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa’ with ‘Bak Kut Teh’ and at the bottom of it
there was a Halal logo. According to SP12 he knows that Bak Kut Teh
contained pork. SP12 then reported the matter to MCMC and SP18 from
MCMC investigated the complaint and was able to trace the Facebook with
Facebook address www.facebook Alvinswinger. SP18 also found that the
Star online had conducted an online interview with an individual who was
the owner of the Facebook named Alvin Tan. Through SP6, the Star online
editor and SP6 gave SP18 the handphone number of Alvin Tan. SP18 then
contacted Alvin Tan who admitted that he was the owner of the Facebook
account and had asked Alvin Tan to come to MCMC to have his statement
taken. SP13 Inspector Seelan had seized from the apartment rented by Tan
Jye Yee and among the items seized was a notebook Samsung (19). The said
notebook Samsung (P19) was analysed by SP9 from MCMC and he found
a few photographs were kept in the file ‘bak kut teh png’ which showed Tan
Jye Yee and the appellant and a caption ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa dengan Bak
Kut Teh ... wangi, enak, menyelerakan’ and the Halal logo. SP9 further
stated that the Facebook address was url http/www.facebook.com/
alvivi.swingers as administrator. The Facebook account address was
registered under the name of ‘Alvin & Vivian-Alvivi’.
[12] The court was of the considered view that although no one actually
saw Tan Jye Yee or the appellant published or uploaded the Facebook
greeting but from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, all pointed to
the fact that the photographs were kept in the file ‘Bak Kut Teh png’ in the
notebook Samsung belonging to Tan Jye Yee and the Facebook account was
registered on Tan Jye Yee and the appellant. The necessary inference which
could be drawn from the evidence by the prosecution witnesses that the
publication was done Tan Jye Yee and the appellant and the photographs
showed both Tan Jye Yee and the appellant together in the photo. There was
no evidence to suggest that the notebook Samsung (P19) was used by others.
In fact, it was kept by Tan Jye Yee at his rented apartment.
[13] The appellant and Tan Jye Yee were charged under s. 4(1)(c) of the
Sedition Act 1948 and read together with s. 34 of the Penal Code which
means that they were jointly charged with a common intention. Tan Jye Yee
and the appellant were having a relationship as girlfriend and boyfriend and
had stayed together in the rented apartment. The appellant’s face and Tan Jye
Yee appeared in the Facebook photograph showed that the appellant was a
willing participant when the Facebook photograph was posted on Facebook.
[14] The learned SCJ on the issue of common intention held that to rely
on direct evidence as proof of common intention was quite difficult but it
could be inferred from the factual matrix of the case. In the instant case,
reliance by the learned SCJ was on inferences arising from the conduct of
Tan Jye and the appellant in the photographs analysed by SP9 were kept in
the file ‘bak kut teh png’ which showed Tan Jye and the appellant and the



748

Current Law Journal

[2018] 10 CLJ

photographs with the caption ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa dengan Bak Kut Teh
... wangi, enak, menyelerakan’ and with the Halal logo. The learned SCJ
found this was sufficient evidence to prove that Tan Jye Yee and the
appellant had the common intention to publish or upload the Facebook
greetings. The court could not have agreed more with the finding of the
learned SCJ on this issue. There was sufficient evidence from the
surrounding circumstances that Tan Jye Yee and the appellant had the
common intention to publish the impugned Facebook greetings.
[15] As for the third ingredient of the offence that is ‘seditious tendency’.
In s. 3(1)(d) of the Act, a seditious tendency is a tendency to raise ‘discontent’
or ‘disaffection’ amongst the subjects of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the
Ruler of any State or amongst the inhabitants of Malaysia or of any State.
In s. 3(1)(e) of the Act states that a seditious tendency is a tendency to
‘promote feelings of ill-will and hostility’ between different races or classes
of the population of Malaysia.
[16] The learned counsel submitted that there was no evidence from any
of the prosecution’s witnesses that:
(i) the Facebook publication has any tendency to raise any discontent or
disaffection amongst the subjects of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the
inhabitants of Malaysia or of any State; or

B

C

D

E

(ii) the Facebook publication has any tendency to promote feelings of illwill or hostility between the different races or classes of population in
Malaysia.
[17] The learned counsel submitted that the words used in the context of
the said publication mean and has the effect of conveying the meaning of a
festive greeting in which the writers sought for permission to introduce their
way of fostering the 1Malaysia spirit by exchanging food amongst the races
in Malaysia and that the right local delicacies should go beyond racial and
religious boundaries. It was further contended by learned counsel that it was
in this context the writers greeted their readers with the words ‘Selamat
Berbuka Puasa with Bak Kut Teh’ together with the use of a Halal logo. The
logo was used to denote the ‘halal’ (as opposed to haram) nature of the food
on display in the Facebook. The defence submitted that there was no
evidence to show that the words could not have achieved one or more of the
objects specified in s. 3(1)(a) to (f) of the Act.
[18] The prosecution submitted that the publication has a tendency to raise
any discontent or disaffection amongst the subjects of the Yang di-Pertuan
Agong or the inhabitants of Malaysia or has a tendency to promote feelings
of ill-will or hostility between the different races or classes of population in
Malaysia.

[19] The learned SCJ held by reference to Mat Shuhaimi Shafie v. PP [2014]
5 CLJ 22 which stated that determination of what language is considered
seditious is a mixed question of law and fact, which was up to the court to
decide. To be seditious, the words published should have a tendency to
achieve one or more of the objects specified in s. 3(1)(a) to (f) of the Act.

B

[20] The court was of the opinion that the publication has a seditious
tendency to promote ill-will and hostility between the races or classes of the
population of Malaysia. The evidence that the publication had caused feelings
of ill-will or hostility between the different races or classes of population in
Malaysia. This was evident from the testimonies of SP2 SP3, SP4, SP8 and
SP12 who expressed their anger, frustration, hurt, regret on the action by Tan
Jye Yee and the appellant. What was the motive of Tan Jye Yee and the
appellant in publishing and uploading on Facebook the photograph with the
heading ‘Selamat Berbuka Puasa (dengan Bak Kut Teh ... wangi, enak,
menyelerakan!!?.’ The learned counsel submitted that the words used in the
context of the said publication mean and has the effect of conveying the
meaning of a festive greeting in which the appellant and Tan Jye Yee sought
for permission to introduce their way of fostering the 1Malaysia spirit by
exchanging food amongst the races in Malaysia and that the right to enjoy
local delicacies should go beyond racial and religious boundaries. It was in
context the ‘writers’ greeted their readers with the “Selamat Berbuka Puasa
with Bak Kut Teh” together with the ‘halal’ logo.

[21] In the instant case, the court agreed with the finding of the learned SCJ
that the publication on the Facebook has a seditious tendency to promote
feelings of ill-will or hostility between the different races or classes of
population in Malaysia.
[22] The learned counsel submitted that the learned SCJ had taken into
account a provision relating to ‘promote feelings of ill-will, hostility or
hatred between persons or groups of persons on the ground of religion.’ This
according to the learned counsel was evident from the judgment written
which made reference to the feelings of the Muslim community rather than
races or classes of population in Malaysia such as Malays, or Indian Muslim.
The charge against the appellant was pursuant to s. 4(1)(c) of the Act and for
purposes seditious tendency is as stated in s. 3(1)(e) ‘to promote feelings of
ill-will and hostility between the races or classes of the population of
Malaysia’. The learned counsel further submitted that s. 3(1)(c) of the Act
does not refer to religion. In the amended Act which came into force on 28
May 2015 an amendment to s. 3(1)(c) was made to specifically made
reference to religion which amended s. 3 of the principal Act by inserting
after para. (e) the following paragraph:
(ea) to promote feelings of ill-will, hostility or hatred between persons or
group of persons on the ground of religion or.

Current Law Journal

[2018] 10 CLJ

[23] This issue was not raised in the petition of appeal by the appellant but
nevertheless the court will state that perusing the judgment of the learned
SCJ, reference was made to races or classes of the population of Malaysia
as it could be gleaned from the judgment at p. 52 of the appeal record
vol. 1 which state as follows:

A

‘Saya mendapati paparan beserta catatan yang terdapat dalam P5 tersebut
boleh mengundang dan mengembangkan niat jahat dan permusuhan
antara golongan penduduk yang berlainan di Malaysia khusus nya umat
Islam.’ The Court was of the view that the reference to ‘khususnya umat
Islam’ did not vitiate or nullify the finding of the learned SCJ.

B

[24] The court upon reading the appeal record and the ground of judgment
on conviction and also read the written submissions and after hearing further
oral submissions from both parties, found that the learned SCJ had
considered the correct principle of law based on the testimonies of the
prosecution and the defence witnesses and hence no appellate intervention on
conviction was necessary. The court dismissed the appeal on conviction and
affirmed the decision on conviction by the learned SCJ.

C

D

Appeal On Sentence
[25] The appeal on inadequacy of sentence was by the prosecution. In the
petition of appeal on sentence, the prosecution stated that the learned SCJ
had erred in law and fact in failing to take into account the seriousness of the
offence committed by the appellant. The prosecution further submit that the
term of imprisonment meted out on the appellant of five months and 22 days
was not deterrent enough to prevent similar offence being committed by
others. The learned SCJ in his judgment on sentence had consider that the
offence committed by the appellant was a serious offence which could
promote feelings of ill-will or hostility between the different races or classes
of population in Malaysia. Having acknowledged the seriousness of the
offence committed by the appellant, the learned SCJ went on to considered
the punishment provided for as stated in s. 4(1) of the Act, that ‘Any person
who shall be guilty of an offence and shall, on conviction be liable for a first
offence to a fine not exceeding five thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for
a term exceeding three years or both and for subsequent offence ...’
[26] The learned SCJ was of the view that since the offence committed by
the appellant was serious, an imprisonment sentence would be an appropriate
punishment meted out on the appellant. The court would think that an
appropriate sentence to be meted out on the appellant would be to impose
a maximum fine of RM5,000 taking into account that the appellant was a first
offender as far as the charge was concerned. It would be more appropriate
to sentence the appellant to an imprisonment sentence if she commits a
subsequent offence. Furthermore, Tan Jye Yee, the co-accused in the charge

had absconded while the appellant appeared in court to answer the charge.
In this respect, the court would tamper justice with mercy by setting aside
the imprisonment sentence and substituting it with a maximum fine of
RM5,000 in default six months imprisonment. The appeal on sentence by the
prosecution is dismissed and the court invoked its inherent power to set aside
the sentence of imprisonment and substituted it with a maximum fine of
RM5,000 in default six months imprisonment.
