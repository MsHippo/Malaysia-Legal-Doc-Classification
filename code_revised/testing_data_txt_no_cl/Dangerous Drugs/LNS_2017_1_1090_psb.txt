Case for the Prosecution
[2]

The prosecution called 9 witnesses to prove the charges against the
accused persons. The prosecution’s evidence revealed these facts.
Acting on information received, at about 3.50 in the morning of 28
June 2013, Inspector Sherman Jackson (“Inspector Sherman”)
(PW7) and a police party raided unit no A-12-7, Block A (“the
apartment”) at East Lake, Section 3, Taman Serdang Perdana, Seri

3

Kembangan. The police party gained entry into the unit by cutting
open the padlock on the grill door and breaking the wooden door.
[3]

Inspector Sherman testified that when they entered the apartment,
the lights were switched on and he found the first and second
accused standing in the living hall. He identified himself and
administered the caution under section 37A(b) of the Dangerous
Drugs Act 1952 (“the Act”) to both of them. No incriminating items
were found on the accused persons when searched. Inspector
Sherman then proceeded to search the apartment in the presence of
the accused persons and found, inter-alia, numerous materials for
processing drugs in the living hall.

[4]

Inspector Sherman also found granular and powdery substance in a
plastic container (exhibit P75) on a table in the first room, which
substance was subsequently analysed by the government chemist,
Puan Norhaya binti Jaafar, (PW6), and found to contain 237.1
grammes of methamphetamine and 1.8 grammes of ketamine.
Inspector Sherman further found on the floor of the living hall, four
glass containers (exhibits P40E, P40G, P40K and P40M) which
contained a liquid substance. The liquid substance was
subsequently analysed by PW6, and found to contain, respectively,
0.8 grammes, 7.2 grammes, 14.3 grammes and 3.35 grammes of
methamphetamine.

[5]

All the items were seized and a search list (exhibit P2) was
prepared. He marked all the items by dating and signing on them.

[6]

At about 6 in the morning, Inspector Yam Tze Yong (PW8), a
forensic officer, came to the apartment to collect samples for DNA
profiling. He collected 18 samples. The samples he collected
included, inter-alia, a towel, cigarette buds and toothbrush. He was
also able to lift 10 fingerprints from the glass containers, exhibits
P40E, P40G and P40K.
4



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

[7]

The items mentioned in the search list and the accused persons
were subsequently handed by Inspector Sherman to Inspector
Mohamad Nor Hafiz bin Ismail (“the investigating officer”) (PW9)
when he came to the apartment the same morning. The
investigating officer testified that he made his own markings on the
drug exhibits and thereafter sent them to PW6 for analysis.

[8]

In cross examination, the investigating officer admitted not sending
the fingerprints collected by PW8 for analysis due to an oversight.
He further admitted that that the DNA samples collected by PW8
were only sent for analysis 7 months after the same had been
handed to him by PW8. In further cross examination, he confirmed
that one Tan Han Cheah was arrested by a different narcotics team
at the same time in another unit in the same apartment block. The
investigating officer also admitted that the accused persons were
neither the owners nor tenants of the apartment and he was not able
to contact the owner.

[9]

Puan Nor Alfarizan binti Mokhtaruddin (PW2) was the government
chemist who conducted the DNA testing on the samples collected
by PW8. She found the DNA of the first accused on the toothbrush
and the cigarette butts, whilst the DNA of the second accused was
found on the towel.

[10] The evidence of Erik Oh Shu Hwang (“PW1”), a real estate agent
showed that the apartment had been rented out by the owner, Lau
Sie Heng to one Yap Kian Hao as evidenced by the tenancy
agreement that was produced and marked as exhibit P9. Exhibit 9
was signed between the owner’s representative, Miss Bibi Lum and
Yap Kian Hao. PW1 accepted that the accused persons were neither
the owner nor the tenant of the apartment. PW1 testified that the
rental for the apartment was paid to him by one Mr Yong.

[11] So much was the evidence from the principal witnesses for the
prosecution. The other witnesses produced by the prosecution gave
general evidence in support of the prosecution.
Burden on prosecution
[12] The burden on the prosecution at the close of the prosecution’s case
to make out a prima facie case is encapsulated in s. 180 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. The nature of the burden on the
prosecution under section 180 was discussed and elucidated by the
Court of Appeal in Balachandran v. Public Prosecutor [2005] 1
CLJ 85; [2005] 2 MLJ 301 as follows:
Section 180(1) makes it clear that the standard of proof on the
prosecution at the close of its case is to make out a prima
facie case while s. 182A(1) enunciates that at the conclusion
of the trial the court shall consider all the evidence adduced
and decide whether the prosecution has proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt. The standard of proof on the
prosecution at the end of its case and at the end of the whole
case has thus been statutorily spelt out in clear terms. The
submission made must therefore be ratiocinated against the
background of the meaning of the phrase ‘prima facie case’ in
s. 180.Section 180(2) provides that the court shall record an
order of acquittal if a prima facie case has not been made out
while s. 180(3) provides that if a prima facie case has been
made out the accused shall be called upon to enter his
defence. A prima facie case is therefore one that is sufficient
for the accused to be called upon to answer. This in turn
means that the evidence adduced must be such that it can be
overthrown only by evidence in rebuttal. The phrase ‘prima
facie case’ is defined in similar terms in Mozley and
Whiteley’s Law Dictionary, (11 th Ed) as:

6



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

A litigating party is said to have a prima facie case
when the evidence in his favour is sufficiently strong
for his opponent to be called on to answer it. A prima
facie case, then, is one which is established by
sufficient evidence, and can be overthrown only by
rebutting evidence adduced by other side.
The result is that the force of the evidence adduced must be
such that, if unrebutted, it is sufficient to induce the court to
believe in the existence of the facts stated in the charge or to
consider its existence so probable that a prudent man ought to
act upon the supposition that those facts exist or did happen.
On the other hand if a prima facie case has not been made out
it means that there is no material evidence which can be
believed in the sense as described earlier. In order to make a
finding either way the court must, at the close of the case for
the prosecution, undertake a positive evaluation of the
credibility and reliability of all the evidence adduced so as to
determine whether the elements of the offence have been
established. As the trial is without a jury it is only with such a
positive evaluation can the court make a determination for the
purpose of s. 180(2) and (3). Of course in a jury trial where
the evaluation is hypothetical the question to be asked would
be whether on the evidence as it stands the accused could
(and not must) lawfully be convicted. That is so because a
determination on facts is a matter for ultimate decision by the
jury at the end of the trial. Since the court, in ruling that a
prima facie case has been made out, must be satisfied that the
evidence adduced can be overthrown only by evidence in
rebuttal it follows that if it is not rebutted it must prevail.
Thus if the accused elects to remain silent he must be
convicted. The test at the close of the case for the prosecution

7



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

would therefore be: Is the evidence sufficient to convict the
accused if he elects to remain silent? If the answer is in the
affirmative then a prima facie case has been made out. This
must, as of necessity, require a consideration of the existence
of any reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution. If
there is any such doubt there can be no prima facie case.
The statutory provisions and case law
[13] For convenience, I will set out the material sections of the Act on
which the prosecution relied on to prove the charge, or which are
otherwise material to this case.
[14] The first charge against the accused persons was framed under
section 39B(1)(a) of the Act which provided:
(1)

No person shall, on his own behalf or on behalf of any
other person, whether or not such other person is in
Malaysia (a)

traffic in a dangerous drug;

(b)

...

(c)

...

[15] The word trafficking is defined in section 2 of the Act as follows:
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires - trafficking
includes the doing any of the following acts, that is to say,
manufacturing, importing, exporting, keeping, concealing,
buying, selling, giving, receiving, storing, administering,
transporting, carrying, sending, delivering, procuring,
supplying or distributing any dangerous drug otherwise than
under the authority of this Act or the regulations made under
the Act.
8



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

[16] To prove trafficking under section 2 of the Act, it was incumbent
on the prosecution to first establish that the accused had possession
of the drugs. The element of possession was essential as an accused
would not be in a position to traffic in drugs unless he was in
possession or in custody or control of the same. This is illustrated
by the judgment of Augustine Paul J in Public Prosecutor v. Chia
Leong Foo [2000] 6 MLJ 705, wherein he explained:
It must be observed that most of the acts that constitute
trafficking as defined in section 2 of the Act like, for
example, keeping, concealing, storing, transporting, and
carrying dangerous drugs involve the prerequisite element of
possession ... It follows that a person cannot keep, conceal,
store, transport, or carry dangerous drugs within the meaning
of trafficking in the Act without being in the possession of
them.
[17] The meaning of possession for the purposes of the Act is well
established. It has been held that there were two elements to
possession. There was the physical element, and the mental
element. The physical element involved proof that the thing was in
the physical custody of the accused or subject to his control. The
mental element involved proof that the accused had knowledge he
was in possession of drugs. In PP v. Muhammad Nasir b
Shaharudin [1994] 2 MLJ 576, the court explained:
Possession is not defined in the DDA. However, it is now
firmly established that to constitute possession, it is necessary
to establish that: (a) the person had knowledge of the drugs;
and (b) that the person had some form of control or custody
of the drugs. To prove either of these two requirements, the
prosecution may either adduce direct evidence or it may rely
on the relevant presumptions under s. 37 of the DDA.

9



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

[18] The second charge against the accused persons was under section
12(2) of the Act which was in these terms:
No person shall have in his possession, custody or control any
dangerous drug to which this Part applies unless he is
authorized to be in possession, custody or control of such
drug or is deemed to be so authorized under this Act or the
regulations made thereunder.
Ingredients of the offence
[19] It is clear from the foregoing that to prove the charges, it was
incumbent on the prosecution to prove:
First charge
i.

that the substance found in P40A, P40E, P40G, P40K
and P40M was dangerous drugs within the definition of
section 2 of the Act: and

ii.

that the drugs were in the possession of the accused
persons drugs pursuant to a common intention between
them; and

iii.

that the drugs were in the possession of the accused
persons for the purpose of trafficking.

Second Charge
i.

that the substance found in P40A was dangerous drugs
within the definition of section 2 of the Act: and

ii.

that the drugs were in the possession of the accused
persons drugs pursuant to a common intention between
them.

10



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

[20] I turn now to examine the evidence led by the prosecution to prove
the ingredients of the offence.
Whether the substance was dangerous drugs within the definition of
section 2 of the Act 1952
[21] As regards the identity of the substance found in the containers
recovered from the apartment, the unchallenged evidence of PW6
established that the substance in P40A contained 237.1 grammes of
methamphetamine and 1.8 grammes of ketamine. And, the
substance in exhibits P40E, P40G, P40K and P40M PW6,
respectively, contained 0.8 grammes, 7.2 grammes, 14.3 grams and
3.35 grammes of methamphetamine. PW6 explained that
methamphetamine and ketamine were dangerous drugs and came
within the definition of section 2 of the Act.
[22] Counsel for the accused contended that as the methamphetamine
was found in two separate places in the apartment, it was not open
to the prosecution to combine the total weight into one charge. I
found no merit in the submission as the drugs were found in the
same apartment.
Whether the accused had Possession of the Dangerous Drugs
[23] To prove that the accused had possession of the drugs, it was
incumbent on the prosecution to establish that the accused had
custody or control and knowledge of the presence of the drugs in
the apartment.
[24] There was no direct evidence to show that the accused persons were
in possession of the dangerous drugs at the material time. The
prosecution therefore relied on circumstantial evidence to make out
the charge with which the accused persons have been charged. The
learned deputy public prosecutor contended that the fact that the

11



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

first and second accused were the only two persons in the apartment
where the drugs were found, coupled with the fact that their DNA
was found on some items in the apartment therein showed they had
were the joint occupiers of the apartment. As joint occupiers, they
had physical custody and control of all the items including the
drugs found therein.
[25] The prosecution also sought to invoke the presumption under
section 37(b) of the Act, which provided:
a person, until the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be
the occupier of any premises, if he has, or appears to have,
the care or management of such premises;
[26] Whilst it is true that the two accused persons were found alone in
the apartment and their DNA was found therein, but that was
insufficient to prove the accused persons were the occupiers of the
apartment for the following reasons.
[27] First, it is settled law that for a person to be an ‘occupier’ of a room
or premises within the meaning of section 37(b) of the Act, he must
have had exclusive occupation or exclusive use and care or
management of the room or premises where the drugs are found.
See PP v. Muhamad Nasir bin Shaharuddin & Anor [1994] 2 MLJ
576 and Kalaiselvan [2001] 2 MLJ157. This means if exclusive
occupation of the premises cannot be established, especially where
other people would also have had access to the premises, it was not
open to the prosecution to contend that the occupier had custody
and control over everything found in the premises. In the instant
case, it was significant that the personal documents and clothings of
the accused persons were not found at the apartment to suggest that
they were living there.

12



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

[28] Secondly, the evidence of PW1 demonstrated that the accused
persons did not have exclusive possession of the apartment where
the police found the drugs. PW1’s evidence indicated that the
tenant of this apartment was Yap Kian Hao and the rent was paid by
one Mr Yong.
[29] Thirdly, the investigation undertaken by the investigating officer to
determine whether the accused persons had exclusive possession of
the apartment was unsatisfactory and shoddy. The evidence of the
investigating officer showed that there were no serious efforts taken
by him to prove that it was only the accused persons who had
exclusive occupancy of the said apartment. No statements were
taken from Yap Kian Hao and Mr Yong and nor were they called as
witnesses though they could have shed light on who was occupying
the premises at the material time. There was a serious gap in the
narrative of the prosecution case without the testimony of these
witnesses. It is trite that witnesses essential to the unfolding of the
narratives on which the prosecution is based, must be called by the
prosecution, whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for
or against the case for the prosecution.
[30] This statement of the law is succinctly set out by the Federal Court
in Ti Chuee Hiang v. PP [1995] 2 MLJ 433:
On the other hand, it is clear law that the prosecution must
have in court all witnesses from whom statements have been
taken, but they have a discretion whether to call them or not.
(See Teh Lee Tong v. PP [1956] MLJ 194.) That discretion,
however, must be exercised having regard to the interests of
justice, which includes being fair to the accused (per Lord
Parker CJ in R v. Oliva [1965] 3 All ER 116 at p 122; [1965]
2 WLR 1028 at p 1035), and to call witnesses essential to the
unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution case is

13



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

based, whether the effect of their testimony is for or against
the prosecution (per Lord Roche in the Ceylon Privy Council
case of Seneviratne v. R [1936] 3 All ER 36 at p 49, applied
in R v. Nugent [1977] 3 All ER 662; [1977] 1 WLR 789).
In R v. Nugent, Park J sitting in the Central Criminal Court
introduced an exception to the rule in Oliva, which says that
if a potential witness concerned is capable of belief, then it is
the prosecutor’s duty to call the witness despite the fact that
the testimony he will be giving will be inconsistent with the
case the prosecution intends to prove (per Lord Parker CJ
[1965] 3 All ER 116 at p 122; [1965] 2 WLR 1028 at pp
1035-1036). The exception introduced by Park J being that if
in the circumstances the calling of the witness concerned by
the prosecution would confuse the jury as to what it is that
the prosecution are seeking to prove, then the prosecution
would be under no duty to call the witness...
Having said that, it is in our view clear law that while the
prosecution has a complete discretion as to the choice of
witnesses to be called at the trial (see, eg Adel Muhammed el
Dabbah v. A-G of Palestine [1944] AC 156 at pp 167-169;
[1944] 2 All ER 139 at pp 143-144), the most basic limitation
upon prosecutorial discretion in the presentation of a case is
that it also has a duty to call all of the necessary witnesses to
establish proof against the accused beyond all reasonable
doubt, and if, in the exercise of its discretion, it fails to fulfil
this obligation - which is nothing less than a statutory duty the accused must be acquitted.
[31] Fourthly, it will be recalled there was evidence that the police were
able to lift fingerprints from the containers in which the drugs were
found. It cannot be gainsaid that the fingerprints was crucial

14



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

evidence that would have shown if the accused persons had
custody, control and possession of the drugs. However, the
investigating officer failed to send the fingerprints to the Chemistry
Department for analysis. The failure to do so merited the drawing
an inference in favour of the accused persons that if sent, it would
have shown that the fingerprints did not belong to either of them.
Support for that approach is to be found in the judgment of the
Federal Court in Lee Kwan Who v. PP [2009] 5 MLJ 301.
[32] It would be useful to briefly narrate the facts in Lee Kwan Who v.
PP. There, it was the prosecution’s case that the accused had
emerged from a car carrying a white plastic bag containing drugs.
The accused had informed the investigating officer that he was not
apprehended the moment he emerged from the car but was arrested
in the compound of the house. The investigating officer however
failed to investigate this allegation at all. In setting aside the
conviction of the accused, the Federal Court held that this was a
serious omission and an inference in the accused’s favour ought to
have been drawn by the learned judge at the close of the
prosecution case. The Federal Court observed:
There are three important evidential points. We take the first.
The appellant’s case as put to the relevant prosecution
witnesses was that he was not apprehended the moment he
emerged from the car. He was arrested in the compound of
house No 52 PW3, the investigation officer confirmed under
cross examination that the appellant had, during
investigations, informed her of this fact. She however failed
to investigate this allegation at all. This is a serious omission.
In Public Prosecutor v. Lim Ah Bek [1989] 2 CLJ 1090 there
was a doubt whether the investigating officer in that case had
investigated the defence of alibi mentioned by the accused in
his cautioned statement. Based on this possible omission,
15



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

Gunn Chit Tuan J (as he then was) drew an inference in
favour of the accused in that case. The present case is much
stronger in that there was no investigation at all. An inference
in the appellant’s favour ought therefore to have been drawn
by the learned judge at the close of the prosecution case. Had
that been done, doubt would have been cast upon the
evidence of PW4 and PW8. Unfortunately this point was
missed by the learned trial judge, no doubt, because of his
ruling. If he had heard the submission of no case by the
appellant, he may perhaps have not acted upon the evidence
of these two witnesses.
[33] Fifthly, no evidence was led as to whether the accused hands or
fingernail clippings were examined for traces of methamphetamine
and ketamine. It cannot be gainsaid that if this had been done it
could have either implicated or exonerated them.
[34] Sixthly, it was true that the accused persons were arrested in the
living room where some of the drugs and drug paraphernalia were
found. Even if an inference can be drawn from this evidence that
the accused persons had knowledge of the existence of the drugs in
the living hall that was not sufficient to constitute custody or
control of the drugs.
[35] There is a long line of cases that have established that mere
knowledge of the presence of drugs is not sufficient to constitute
possession of the dangerous drugs. See PP v. Khoo Boo Hock &
Anor [1990] 2 CLJ 971, Public Prosecutor v. Lin Lian Chen [1992]
2 MLJ 561 and Choo Yoke Choy v. PP [1992] 2 MLJ 632. In the
third case, the Supreme Court held:
In order to found a conviction, the prosecution must establish
not only that the appellant had knowledge of the existence of

16



[2017] 1 LNS 1090

Legal Network Series

the drugs but that he also had exclusive custody or control of
them.
[36] The evidence against the accused persons amounted only to grave
suspicion and was insufficient to show they had custody or control
of the drugs. I therefore found that the prosecution had failed to
prove its case against the accused persons in respect of both
charges.
Conclusion
[37] In the upshot, I was satisfied that the prosecution had not made out

them to enter their defence.
