CRIMINAL LAW: Money laundering – Offences – Allegation of – Freezing of
property – Freezing and seizure order – Appellant’s bank account held/frozen and
seized by respondents – Whether monies in appellant’s account subject matter of
offence under s. 4(1) of Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and
Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (‘AMLATEPUA’) – Application for release
of all monies held/frozen and seized by respondents – Whether s. 52A

account although freezing and seizure orders had long ceased to have effect –
Whether appellant’s account should be released on expiration of freezing and seizure
orders – Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of
Unlawful Activities Act 2001, ss. 44(5), 50(1), 55(1) & 56
The appellant, by originating summons, prayed for, inter alia, the release of
all monies together with all accrued interest in his CIMB bank account
(‘the appellant’s account’) held/frozen and seized by the respondents.
Pursuant to a freezing order issued by the police under s. 44(1) of the
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001
(‘the AMLATFA’), the appellant’s account was frozen with effect from
24 June 2014. Paragraph 3 of the freezing order expressly states that the
order was valid for 90 days, which means it would cease to have effect on
21 September 2014 if the appellant was not charged with an offence under
the AMLATFA or a terrorism financing offence, as the case may be. The
90- day period is prescribed by s. 44(5) of the AMLATFA. The AMLATFA
is now known as the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and
Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (‘the AMLATEPUA’) vide s. 3 of
the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing (Amendment)
Act 2014 with effect from 1 September 2014. On 11 September 2014, ten
days before the freezing order issued under s. 44(1) of the AMLATFA
expired on 21 September 2014, a seizure order was issued by the Public
Prosecutor on the appellant’s account pursuant to s. 50(1) of the
AMLATEPUA on the basis that the monies in the appellant’s account was
the subject matter of an offence under s. 4(1) of the AMLATEPUA allegedly
committed by his mother. Thus, by virtue of s. 52A of the AMLATEPUA,
the seizure order issued on the appellant’s account on 11 September 2014
expired on the following dates: on 23 June 2015 ie, 12 months after the

issuance of the freezing order on 24 June 2014 and on 10 September 2015
ie, 12 months after the issuance of the seizure order on 11 September 2014.
When the present originating summons was filed on 5 May 2016, the
respondents continued to freeze the appellant’s account although the freezing
and seizure orders had long ceased to have effect by reason of the fact that
the appellant had not been charged with an offence under the AMLATEPUA
on expiration of these two orders. The respondents contended that s. 52A of
the AMLATEPUA does not apply retrospectively, and that therefore the
seizure order, which was issued pursuant to the freezing order dated 24 June
2014 (issued under s. 44(1) of the AMLATFA) was not subject to the 12
month limitation period prescribed by s. 52A.

Held (allowing appeal with costs)
Per Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) The seizure order was effected on the appellant’s account on
11 September 2014, well after the coming into force of s. 52A of the
AMLATEPUA on 1 September 2014. The limitation period therefore
expired on 23 June 2015 ie, 12 months after the issuance of the freezing
order on 24 June 2014, or latest by 10 September 2015 ie, 12 months
after the issuance of the seizure order on 11 September 2014. Whichever
date was to be taken into consideration, the seizure order had ceased to
have effect by the time the present originating summons was filed by the
appellant. (para 15)
(2) Section 50(1) of the AMLATEPUA must not be read in isolation. It
must be read together with s. 52A. The Public Prosecutor’s power to
vary or revoke the seizure order could only be exercised before the
expiration of the order, and not after. Clearly, once the seizure order had
expired by effluxion of time, there is nothing for the Public Prosecutor
to revoke. To hold otherwise would be to violate art. 13(1) of the
Federal Constitution, which provides that no person shall be deprived
of property save in accordance with law. (paras 23 & 24)
(3) Section 56 of the AMLATEPUA speaks of forfeiture of ‘any property
seized under this Act’ where there is no prosecution or conviction for
an offence under s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence. The appellant’s
account fell under this class of properties. However, before the
provision is activated, there must first be an application by the Public
Prosecutor for forfeiture of the seized property and the application must
be made within 12 months from the date of seizure, failing which
sub-s. (3) mandates that the property must be returned to the person
from whom it was seized. There was no such application by the Public
Prosecutor in the present case. (para 33)
(4) In a situation where the seized property is required to be released to the
person from whom it was seized after the expiration of the freezing or
seizure order as envisaged by s. 52A and upon expiration of the period

prescribed by s. 56(3), it stands to reason that the property could not be
forfeited by way of a proceeding under s. 55(1), that is, by way of
criminal prosecution against some other person for an offence under
s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence. To allow the Public Prosecutor
to do so would be to allow him to ignore and circumvent the limitation
period prescribed by both ss. 52A and 56(3) of the AMLATEPUA. That
would defeat the object behind the two provisions rather than to put
their object into effect, which is for the release or return of the property
to the person from whom the property is seized if there is no prosecution
against that person for an offence under the AMLATEPUA after the
expiration of the seizure order. (paras 37 & 38)
(5) The appellant was not charged with an offence under s. 4(1) or a
terrorism financing offence after the expiration of the freezing and
seizure orders. It was his mother who was charged with that offence.
Nor did the Public Prosecutor apply for forfeiture of the monies in the
appellant’s account under s. 56(1). Thus, by virtue of s. 52A of the
AMLATEPUA, the freezing and seizure orders ceased to have effect.
The fact that the appellant’s account was the subject matter of a criminal
proceeding against the appellant’s mother under s. 4(1)(a) of the
AMLATEPUA was of no consequence as the freezing and seizure orders
relate to the appellant’s account and not his mother’s account, and both
orders had ceased to have effect. (paras 40 & 41)
(6) Since there was no dispute that the freezing and seizure orders had
ceased to have effect, the only issue before the court was whether the
appellant’s account should be released on expiration of the freezing and
seizure orders. Having regards to the provisions of ss. 44(5) and 52A of
the AMLATEPUA, the answer to the question had to be in the
affirmative. (para 42)

Perayu, melalui saman pemula, menuntut untuk, antara lain, pelepasan
segala wang bersama dengan semua faedah terakru dalam akaun bank CIMB
(‘akaun perayu’) yang dipegang/dibeku dan dirampas responden-responden.
Menurut perintah pembekuan yang dikeluarkan oleh pihak polis bawah
s. 44(1) Akta Pencegahan Pengubahan Wang Haram dan Pencegahan
Pembiayaan Keganasan 2001 (‘AMLATFA’), akaun perayu dibeku berkuat
kuasa 24 Jun 2014. Perenggan 3 perintah pembekuan dengan jelas
menyatakan perintah sah untuk 90 hari, bermakna ia akan menjadi tidak
berkesan pada 21 September 2014 jika perayu tidak dituduh dengan
kesalahan bawah AMLATFA atau kesalahan pembiayaan keganasan,
mengikut keadaan. Tempoh 90 hari ditetapkan oleh s. 44(5) AMLATFA.

berkuat kuasa 1 September 2014. Pada 11 September 2014, sepuluh hari
sebelum perintah pembekuan dikeluarkan bawah s. 44(1) AMLATFA tamat
tempoh pada 21 September 2014, satu perintah rampasan dikeluarkan oleh
Pendakwa Raya terhadap akaun perayu menurut s. 50(1) AMLATEPUA atas
dasar bahawa wang dalam akaun perayu adalah hal perkara satu kesalahan
bawah s. 4(1) AMLATEPUA yang didakwa dilakukan oleh ibunya. Maka,
menurut kuasa s. 52A AMLATEPUA, perintah rampasan yang dikeluarkan
ke atas akaun perayu pada 11 September 2014 tamat tempohnya pada tarikhtarikh berikut: pada 23 Jun 2015 iaitu 12 bulan selepas pengeluaran perintah
pembekuan pada 24 Jun 2014 dan pada 10 September 2015 iaitu 12 bulan
selepas pengeluaran perintah rampasan pada 11 September 2014. Bila saman
pemula difailkan pada 5 Mei 2016, responden masih membeku akaun perayu
walaupun perintah pembekuan dan rampasan telah lama tidak mempunyai
kesan kerana perayu tidak dikenakan tuduhan dengan kesalahan bawah
AMLATEPUA pada tarikh penamatan kedua-dua perintah tersebut.
Responden-responden menghujahkan bahawa s. 52A AMLATEPUA tidak
diguna pakai secara retrospektif dan dengan itu perintah rampasan, yang
dikeluarkan menurut perintah pembekuan bertarikh 24 Jun 2014
(yang dikeluarkan bawah s. 44(1) AMLATFA) tidak tertakluk kepada
tempoh had masa 12 bulan yang ditetapkan oleh s. 52A.
Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan dengan kos)
Oleh Abdul Rahman Sebli HMR menyampaikan penghakiman
mahkamah:
(1) Perintah rampasan berkuat kuasa ke atas akaun perayu pada
11 September 2014, selepas penguatkuasaan s. 52A AMLATEPUA
pada 1 September 2014. Tempoh had masa dengan itu tamat tempohnya
pada 23 Jun 2015, iaitu 12 bulan selepas pengeluaran perintah
pembekuan pada 24 Jun 2014, atau paling lewat 10 September 2015
iaitu 12 bulan selepas pengeluaran perintah rampasan pada
11 September 2014. Mana-mana tarikh yang diambil kira, perintah
rampasan tidak berkuat kuasa lagi apabila saman pemula ini difailkan
oleh perayu.
(2) Seksyen 50(1) AMLATEPUA tidak patut dibaca secara berasingan. Ia
harus dibaca bersama-sama dengan s. 52A. Kuasa Pendakwa Raya untuk
mengubahkan atau membatalkan perintah rampasan hanya boleh
dilaksanakan sebelum tamat tempoh perintah, dan bukan selepas.
Dengan jelasnya, sebaik sahaja perintah rampasan tamat tempoh melalui
peluputan masa, tiada apa-apa untuk Pendakwa Raya membatalkan.
Untuk memutuskan sebaliknya akan melanggar per. 13(1) Perlembagaan
Persekutuan yang memperuntukkan bahawa tiada orang akan dilucutkan
harta kecuali mengikut undang-undang.

(3) Seksyen 56 AMLATEPUA menyatakan berkenaan pelucuthakan ‘any
property seized under this Act’ di mana tiada pendakwaan atau sabitan
untuk kesalahan bawah s. 4(1) atau kesalahan pembiayaan keganasan.
Akaun perayu terangkum dalam golongan hartanah ini. Walau
bagaimanapun, sebelum peruntukan diaktifkan, harus terdapat
permohonan oleh Pendakwa Raya terlebih dahulu untuk pelucuthakan
hartanah yang dirampas dan permohonan harus dibuat dalam tempoh 12
bulan daripada tarikh rampasan, dan jika gagal berbuat demikian,
sub-s. (3) memberi mandat hartanah harus dikembalikan kepada pihak
dari mana ia dirampas. Tiada permohonan sebegitu oleh Pendakwa Raya
dalam kes ini.
(4) Dalam situasi di mana hartanah yang dirampas harus dilepaskan kepada
pihak dari mana ia dirampas selepas tamat tempoh perintah pembekuan
atau rampasan seperti yang dijangkakan oleh s. 52A dan apabila tamat
tempoh had yang ditentukan s. 56(3), adalah jelas hartanah tidak boleh
dilucuthakkan melalui prosiding bawah s. 55(1), iaitu, melalui
pendakwaan jenayah terhadap pihak yang lain untuk kesalahan bawah
s. 4(1) atau kesalahan pembiayaan keganasan. Untuk membenarkan
Pendakwa Raya berbuat demikian adalah untuk membenarkannya
mengabaikan dan memintas tempoh pengehadan yang ditentukan oleh
kedua-dua ss. 52A dan 56(3) AMLATEPUA. Ini akan mematahkan
objek kedua-dua peruntukan dan bukan menguatkuasakan objek, iaitu
untuk pelepasan atau pengembalian hartanah kepada pihak dari mana ia
dirampas jika tiada pendakwaan terhadap pihak itu untuk kesalahan
bawah AMLATEPUA selepas tamat tempoh perintah rampasan.
(5) Perayu tidak dituduh dengan kesalahan bawah s. 4(1) atau kesalahan
pembiayaan keganasan selepas tamat tempoh perintah pembekuan dan
rampasan. Yang dituduh dengan kesalahan itu adalah ibu perayu.
Pendakwa Raya juga tidak memohon untuk pelucuthakan wang dalam
akaun perayu bawah s. 56(1). Oleh itu, menurut kuasa s. 52A
AMLATEPUA, perintah pembekuan dan rampasan tidak lagi berkuat
kuasa. Fakta bahawa akaun perayu adalah hal perkara prosiding jenayah
terhadap ibu perayu bawah s. 4(1)(a) AMLATEPUA tidak mempunyai
apa-apa kesan kerana perintah pembekuan dan rampasan adalah
berhubungan akaun perayu dan bukan akaun ibu perayu dan kedua-dua
perintah tidak lagi berkuat kuasa.
(6) Oleh kerana tiada pertikaian perintah pembekuan dan rampasan tidak
lagi berkuat kuasa, hanya satu isu sahaja yang berbangkit di hadapan
mahkamah iaitu sama ada akaun perayu harus dilepaskan apabila
perintah pembekuan dan rampasan tamat tempoh. Dengan mengambil
kira peruntukan ss. 44(5) dan 52A AMLATEPUA, jawapan kepada
soalan itu adalah dijawab secara afirmatif.

JUDGMENT
Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:
[1]
In the court below, the appellant by originating summons prayed for
the following orders against the respondents:
(a) the release of all monies together with all accrued interest in his CIMB
Bank Account No. 25164 (“the appellant’s account”) held/frozen and
seized by the respondents;

F

G

(b) costs and other reliefs.
[2]
At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned High Court Judge
dismissed the appellant’s application on the ground that he failed to prove
his case on the balance of probabilities, hence the present appeal before us.
Having heard arguments by both sides, we reserved judgment to a date to be
fixed. We have now reached a unanimous decision and this is our judgment.
[3]
First, the salient facts. Pursuant to a freezing order issued by the police
under s. 44(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing
Act 2001 (“the AMLATFA”), the appellant’s account was frozen with effect
from 24 June 2014. Paragraph 3 of the freezing order expressly states that

the order was valid for 90 days, which means it would cease to have effect
on 21 September 2014 if the appellant was not charged with an offence under
the AMLATFA or a terrorism financing offence, as the case may be. The
90-day period is prescribed by s. 44(5) of the AMLATFA.
[4]
The AMLATFA is now known as the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001
(“the AMLATEPUA”) vide s. 3 of the Anti-Money Laundering and
Anti-Terrorism Financing (Amendment) Act 2014 (Act A1467) with effect
from 1 September 2014 (see P.U.(B)400/2014). Section 52A of the
AMLATEPUA reads as follows:
Expiry of seizure order
52A. A seizure order made under this Act shall cease to have effect after
the expiration of twelve months from the date of the seizure order, or
where there is a prior freezing order, twelve months from the date of the
freezing order, if the person against whom the order was made has not
been charged with an offence under this Act.

[5]
This new provision is not found in the AMLATFA. On 11 September
2014, that is ten days after the coming into force of the AMLATEPUA, and
before the freezing order issued under s. 44(1) of the AMLATFA expired on
21 September 2014, a seizure order was issued by the Public Prosecutor on
the appellant’s account pursuant to s. 50(1) of the AMLATEPUA.
[6]
The basis for the seizure order was that the monies in the appellant’s
account are the subject matter of an offence under s. 4(1) of the
AMLATEPUA allegedly committed by his mother, one Tan Hoo Eng,
following Sg Bernam Police Report No. 2950/14.
[7]
Tan Hoo Eng has since been charged with 21 counts of money
laundering under s. 4(1)(a) of the AMLATEPUA. We were told that the
criminal proceeding against Tan Hoo Eng is pending before the Sessions
Court at Ipoh, Perak.

G

H

I

[8]
There is no ambiguity in s. 52A of the AMLATEPUA. What it means
is that a seizure order issued under s. 50(1) ceases to have effect in the
following two situations:
(a) if the person from whom the property was seized has not been charged
with an offence under the AMLATEPUA on expiration of the seizure
order, which is 12 months from the date of the seizure order; or
(b) if the person from whom the property was seized has not been charged
with an offence under the AMLATEPUA after the expiration of a prior
freezing order, if any, which is 12 months after the issuance of the
freezing order.

[2018] 8 CLJ

[9]
In the present case, there was a prior freezing order issued on the
appellant’s account before it was seized on 11 September 2014. Therefore,
the seizure order ceased to have effect on 23 June 2015. The legislative intent
behind s. 52A is clear, and that is for the release of the property to the person
from whom it was seized if the person has not been charged with an offence
under the AMLATEPUA on expiration of the freezing or seizure order,
whichever is earlier.

A

B

[10] Thus, by virtue of s. 52A of the AMLATEPUA, the seizure order
issued on the appellant’s account on 11 September 2014 expired on the
following dates:
(i) on 23 June 2015, ie, 12 months after the issuance of the freezing order
on 24 June 2014.

C

(ii) on 10 September 2015, ie, 12 months after the issuance of the seizure
order on 11 September 2014.
[11] When the present originating summons was filed on 5 May 2016, the
respondents continued to freeze the appellant’s account although the freezing
and seizure orders had long ceased to have effect by reason of the fact that
the appellant had not been charged with an offence under the AMLATEPUA
on expiration of these two orders.
[12] We note that both s. 44(5) of the AMLATFA and s. 44(5) of the
AMLATEPUA limit the lifespan of a freezing order issued under s. 44(1) to
90 days only, unless the person against whom the freezing order was made
has been charged with an offence under the AMLATFA or the
AMLATEPUA or a terrorism financing offence before the order ceases to
have effect. We reproduce below s. 44(5) for ease of reference:

D

E

F

(5) An order made under subsection (1) shall cease to have effect after
ninety days from the date of the order, if the person against whom the
order was made has not been charged with an offence under this Act or
a terrorism financing offence, as the case may be.

[13] On the face of it, there is a contradiction in terms between s. 44(5) and
s. 52A of the AMLATEPUA. Whilst the former prescribes a lifespan of only
90 days for a freezing order, the latter prescribes a longer lifespan of 12
months from the date of a “prior freezing order” for the purposes of
computing the lifespan of a seizure order.

G

H

[14] Learned counsel for the respondents contended that s. 52A of the
AMLATEPUA does not apply retrospectively and that therefore the seizure
order, which was issued pursuant to the freezing order dated 24 June 2014
(issued under s. 44(1) of the AMLATFA) is not subject to the 12-month
limitation period prescribed by s. 52A.
[15] With due respect, we find no substance to the argument. The seizure
order was effected on the appellant’s account on 11 September 2014, well
after the coming into force of s. 52A on 1 September 2014. The limitation

I

B

period therefore expired on 23 June 2015, ie, 12 months after the issuance
of the freezing order on 24 June 2014, or latest by 10 September 2015, ie,
12 months after the issuance of the seizure order on 11 September 2014.
Whichever date is to be taken into consideration, the seizure order had
ceased to have effect by the time the present originating summons was filed
by the appellant.
[16] Since the seizure order had expired by operation of s. 52A of the
AMLATEPUA and the appellant has not been charged with an offence under
the Act or a terrorism financing offence, the appellant’s account should have
been released on expiration of the seizure order.

C

D

[17] In fact, going by s. 44(5) of both the AMLATEPUA and the
AMLATFA, the appellant’s account should have been released earlier, ie,
on 21 September 2014 (90 days after the issuance of the freezing order on
24 June 2014) and not on 10 September 2015 (12 months after the issuance
of the seizure order on 11 September 2014 as prescribed by s. 52A).
[18] The second, third and fourth respondents do not in fact dispute that
the freezing and seizure orders had expired, but argued that the orders should
remain in force, for the following reasons:

E

(a) the seizure order is valid until otherwise revoked or varied under
s. 50(1) of the AMLATEPUA;
(b) the appellant’s account is the subject matter of an offence committed by
the appellant’s mother Tan Hoo Eng under s. 4(1)(a) of the
AMLATEPUA;

F

G

H

(c) the freezing and seizure orders relate to a criminal investigation and as
such could not be reviewed by the court in a civil proceeding:
City Growth Sdn Bhd & Anor v. The Government of Malaysia [2005] 7 CLJ
422; Simplex Sdn Bhd lwn. Mohd Samsol Md Muzer & Satu Lagi [2014]
1 LNS 1278; [2015] 9 MLJ 78; R v. Sloan [1990] 1 NZLR 47.
[19] As for the first respondent (CIMB Bank), its answer to the appellant’s
claim was that it had been advised by the second and third respondents to
hold on to the freezing and seizure orders as there is a criminal proceeding
pending against the appellant’s mother under the AMLATEPUA and as such
the two orders should continue to operate against the appellant’s account
until after the disposal of the criminal proceeding.
[20] Section 50(1) of the AMLATEPUA, which all four respondents relied
on to justify the continued freezing of the appellant’s account, reads:
50. Seizure of moveable property in financial institution

I

(1) Where the Public Prosecutor is satisfied on information given to him
by an investigating officer that any movable property or any accretion to
it which is:
(a) the subject-matter or evidence relating to the commission of an
offence under subsection 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence;

(b) terrorist property;

A

(c) the proceeds of an unlawful activity; or
(d) the instrumentalities of an offence,
is in the possession, custody or control of a financial institution, he may,
notwithstanding any other written law, by order direct that such moveable
property or any accretion to it in the financial institution be seized by the
investigating officer or by order direct the financial institution not to part
with, deal in or otherwise dispose of such movable property or any
accretion to it, in whole or in part, until the order is varied or revoked.

[21] CIMB Bank’s argument was that unless and until the seizure order is
varied or revoked by the Public Prosecutor, it is in no position to release the
appellant’s account or to allow him to operate it until further notice by the
second and third respondents. The bank’s predicament is understandable
given the threat of severe penal sanction by s. 50(3), which reads:
(3) Any person who fails to comply with an order of the Public Prosecutor
under subsection (1) commits an offence and shall on conviction, be liable
to a fine not exceeding five times the amount which was parted with,
dealt in or otherwise disposed of in contravention of the Public
Prosecutor’s order or five million ringgit, whichever is the higher or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or to both, and in the
case of a continuing offence, shall in addition be liable to a fine not
exceeding five thousand ringgit for each day or part thereof during which
the offence continues to be committed.

[22] In acceding to the respondents’ argument that it is lawful for the
respondents to continue freezing the appellant’s account despite the
expiration of the freezing and seizure orders, the learned judge reasoned as
follows:
[21] I hold further that although the period of twelve (12) months has
lapsed and there is no prosecution preferred as yet against the plaintiff,
his right to access the funds in the said frozen and seized account
immediate and/or absolute, it is subject always to the order being varied
and/or revoked as the case may be (see Section 50(1) of the AMLATFA,
supra). However, such is not the case here. The court must be slow to
interfere with the enforcement matter so as not to interfere in the relevant
authorities’ investigation and subsequent prosecution of the wrongdoer.
The power of investigation is the responsibility of the enforcement agency
while the Attorney General, has the power to prosecute. The court must
not be used as an instrument to derail and/or hamper these two
institutions from carrying out their responsibilities in rooting out criminal
wrongdoings.

[23] With due respect to the learned judge, the reasoning is seriously
flawed. Section 50(1) of the AMLATEPUA must not be read in isolation.
It must be read together with s. 52A. Had the learned judge done so, she
would have realised that the Public Prosecutor’s power to vary or revoke the
seizure order could only be exercised before the expiration of the order, and
not after.

[24] Clearly, once the seizure order had expired by effluxion of time, there
is nothing for the Public Prosecutor to vary or revoke. To hold otherwise
would be to violate art. 13(1) of the Federal Constitution, which provides
that no person shall be deprived of property save in accordance with law.
[25] Courts are not allowed to usurp the function of the Legislature by
reading words into the statute. This is familiar law. Suffice it if we cite the
case of Government of Malaysia v. Mohamed Amin Hassan [1985] 1 LNS 79;
[1986] 1 MLJ 224 where the Supreme Court made the following
observations:
In the matter of construction it is well to remember that in Magor & St
Mellons Rural District Council v. Newport Corporation [1952] AC 189 191 the
House of Lords has laid down clearly that in construing a statute the duty
of the court is limited to interpreting the words used by the legislature and
it has no power to fill in any gaps disclosed. To do so would be to usurp
the function of the legislature. In that case Lord Simonds made this
important observation:
‘The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature
has used; those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are,
the power and duty of the court to travel outside them on a
voyage of discovery are strictly limited.’

[26] We were referred to s. 54(3) of the AMLATEPUA by the respondents
for the proposition that since the freezing and seizure orders relate to a
criminal investigation, they cannot be reviewed by the court in a civil
proceeding. Section 54(3) provides as follows:
(3) For so long as a seizure of any property under this Act remains in
force, no action, suit or other proceedings of a civil nature shall be
instituted, or if it is pending immediately before such seizure, be
maintained or continued in any court or before any other authority in
respect of the property which has been so seized, and no attachment,
execution or other similar process shall be commenced, or if any such
process is pending immediately before such seizure, be maintained or
continued, in respect of such property on account of any claim, judgment
or decree, regardless whether such claim was made, or such judgment or
decree was given, before or after such seizure was effected, except at the
instance of the Federal Government or the Government of a State, or at
the instance of the local authority or other statutory authority, or except
with the prior consent in writing of the Public Prosecutor.

[27] The provision clearly does not apply. The operative words are “for so
long as a seizure of any property under this Act remains in force”. In the
present case, the seizure order on the appellant’s account is no longer in force
as it had expired, the first time on 23 June 2015 (12 months after the issuance
of the freezing order on 24 June 2014) and the second time on 10 September
2015 (12 months after the issuance of the seizure order itself on 11 September
2014).

[2018] 8 CLJ

[28] As we indicated earlier, by virtue of s. 44(5) of both the AMLATFA
and the AMLATEPUA, the freezing order (pursuant to which the seizure
order was made on 11 September 2014) had in fact ceased to have effect on
21 September 2014 (90 days after it was issued on 24 June 2014).
[29] It is important to bear in mind that the proceeding in the High Court
was not a proceeding to forfeit the monies in the appellant’s account. The
sole purpose of the proceeding was to determine whether the appellant’s
account should be released, given the fact that he has not been charged with
an offence under the AMLATEPUA after the expiration of the freezing and
seizure orders.
[30] Under the AMLATEPUA, there are two situations where seized
property ‘shall’ be forfeited. The first situation is where there is a prosecution
for an offence under s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence. The second
situation is where there is no such prosecution. The first situation is regulated
by s. 55, which reads:

A

B

C

D

55. Forfeiture of property upon prosecution for an offence
(1) Subject to section 61, in any prosecution for an offence under
subsection 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence, the court shall make an
order for the forfeiture of any property which is proved to be –
(a) the subject-matter or evidence relating to the commission of such
offence;

E

(b) terrorist property;
(c) the proceeds of an unlawful activity; or
(d) the instrumentalities of an offence,

F

where –
(aa) the offence is proved against the accused; or
(bb) the offence is not proved against the accused but the court is
satisfied that:

G

(i) the accused is not the true and lawful owner of such property;
and
(ii) no other person is entitled to the property as a purchaser in
good faith for valuable consideration.
(2) Where the offence is proved against the accused but the property
referred to in subsection (1) has been disposed of, diminished in value or
cannot be traced, the court shall order the accused to pay as a penalty a
sum which is equivalent to, in the opinion of the court, the value of the
property, and any such penalty shall be recoverable as a civil debt due to
the Government of Malaysia and shall not be subject to any period of
limitation prescribed by any written law.

(d) the instrumentalities of an offence,

D

[31] There is no mention of seized or frozen property in this section but
it provides for mandatory forfeiture of ‘any property’ if it is proved to be
property falling under paras. (a) to (d) of sub-s. (1). The prerequisite is that
there must be a prosecution under s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence
before the court could make a forfeiture order. Section 55(1) expressly
provides that a forfeiture order can only be made if the court is satisfied that
the requirements of paras. (aa) or (bb) are fulfilled.
[32]

The second situation is regulated by s. 56, which provides as follows:

56. Forfeiture of property where there is no prosecution.

E

F

(1) Subject to section 61, where in respect of any property seized under
this Act there is no prosecution or conviction for an offence under
subsection 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence, the Public Prosecutor
may, before the expiration of twelve months from the date of the seizure,
or where there is a freezing order, twelve months from the date of the
freezing, apply to a judge of the High Court for an order of forfeiture of
that property if he is satisfied that such property is:
(a) the subject-matter or evidence relating to the commission of such
offence;
(b) terrorist property;
(c) the proceeds of an unlawful activity; or

G

(d) the instrumentalities of an offence.
(2) The judge to whom an application is made under subsection (1) shall
make an order for the forfeiture of the property if he is satisfied –
(a) that the property is:

H

(i) the subject-matter or evidence relating to the commission of an
offence under subsection 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence;
(ii) terrorist property;
(iii) the proceeds of an unlawful activity; or

(iv) the instrumentalities of an offence; and
(b) that there is no purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration
in respect of the property.

(emphasis added)

[33] Section 56 speaks of forfeiture of “any property seized under this Act”
where there is no prosecution or conviction for an offence under s. 4(1) or
a terrorism financing offence. The appellant’s account falls under this class
of properties. However, before the provision is activated, there must first be
an application by the Public Prosecutor for forfeiture of the seized property
and the application must be made within 12 months from the date of seizure
order, failing which sub-s. (3) mandates that the property must be returned
to the person from whom it was seized. There was no such application by
the Public Prosecutor in the present case.
[34] At first blush, there appears to be a conflict between s. 55(1) and
ss. 52A and 56(3) of the AMLATEPUA. Whilst both s. 52A and s. 56(3)
envisage the release of the seized property if no criminal prosecution is
instituted within 12 months from the date of the freezing or seizure order,
s. 55(1) on the other hand stipulates that where there is a prosecution for an
offence under s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence, the seized property
must be forfeited if the requirements are met, that is, if the property is proved
to be:

D

E

F

G

(a) the subject-matter or evidence relating to the commission of such
offence;
(b) terrorist property;
(c) the proceeds of an unlawful activity;

H

(d) the instrumentalities of an offence,
where:
(aa) the offence is proved against the accused; or
(bb) the offence is not proved against the accused but the court is
satisfied that:
(i) the accused is not the true and lawful owner of such property;

(ii) no other person is entitled to the property as a purchaser in
good faith for valuable consideration.

[35] Having given the matter careful consideration, we do not think that the
effect of s. 55(1) is to override ss. 52A and 56(3) of the AMLATEPUA. The
three provisions cater to two different situations. Section 52A and s. 56(3)
provide for the release or return of the seized property where there is no
prosecution against the person from whom the property was seized, whereas
s. 55(1) provides for forfeiture where there is a prosecution under s. 4(1) or
a terrorism financing offence.
[36] The prosecuted person under s. 55(1) must necessarily refer to the
person from whom the property was seized pursuant to s. 50(1) of the
AMLATEPUA, who in the present case is the appellant. But the fact is, the
appellant has not been prosecuted for an offence under s. 4(1) or a terrorism
financing offence.
[37] In a situation where the seized property is required to be released to
the person from whom it was seized after the expiration of the freezing or
seizure order as envisaged by s. 52A and upon expiration of the period
prescribed by s. 56(3), it stands to reason that the property cannot be forfeited
by way of a proceeding under s. 55(1), that is, by way of a criminal
prosecution against some other person for an offence under s. 4(1) or a
terrorism financing offence.
[38] To allow the Public Prosecutor to do so will be to allow him to ignore
and circumvent the limitation period prescribed by both s. 52A and s. 56(3)
of the AMLATEPUA. That will defeat the object behind the two provisions
rather than to put their object into effect, which is for the release or return
of the property to the person from whom the property is seized if there is
no prosecution against that person for an offence under the AMLATEPUA
after the expiration of the seizure order.
[39] Such construction will also render s. 52A and s. 56(3) otiose, which
could not have been the intention of the Legislature when enacting the two
provisions. It is axiomatic that Parliament does not legislate in vain. In any
event, it is trite principle that where there is a conflict between two or more
provisions in a statute of this nature, the court must give a construction that
is most favourable to the subject.
[40] It bears repeating that in the present case, the appellant was not
charged with an offence under s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence after
the expiration of the freezing and seizure orders. It was his mother who was
charged with that offence. Nor did the Public Prosecutor apply for forfeiture
of the monies in the appellant’s account under s. 56(1). Thus, by virtue of
s. 52A of the AMLATEPUA, the freezing and seizure orders have ceased to
have effect. It must follow that the appellant’s account must be released on
expiration of the orders.

[2018] 8 CLJ

[41] The fact that the appellant’s account is the subject matter of a criminal
proceeding against the appellant’s mother under s. 4(1)(a) of the
AMLATEPUA is of no consequence as the freezing and seizure orders relate
to the appellant’s account and not his mother’s account, and both orders have
ceased to have effect.

A

[42] Since there is no dispute that the freezing and seizure orders have
ceased to have effect, the only issue before the court was whether the
appellant’s account should be released on expiration of the freezing and
seizure orders. Having regard to the provisions of s. 44(5) and s. 52A of the
AMLATEPUA, the answer to the question has to be in the affirmative.

B

[43] For all the reasons aforesaid, we allow the appellant’s appeal with
costs, to be borne by the second, third and fourth respondents and payable
to the appellant. We set aside the order of the High Court dated 23 May 2017
and we allow prayer (1) of the appellant’s originating summons. The deposit
is to be refunded to the appellant.
