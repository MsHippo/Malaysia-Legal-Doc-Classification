pemilikpenghuni tanahtanah ‘ tanah tersebut ’ di kawasan perkampungan baru yang dipanggil kampung sungai terentang rawang selangor ‘ new village ’ pada tahun 1974 lln ‘ perayu pendulu ’ telah memasang tiang keluli di atas tanah tersebut untuk mengangkat tali penyiaran 33kv 4 current law journal 2010 2 clj yang melalui new village pada tahun 1986 kerajaan negeri selangor telah berimilik tanah tersebut kepada respondenresponden pada sekitar tahun 2005 perayu telah menjalankan projek yang memerlukan grid voltan tinggi dengan kebolehan 270kv untuk dipasang melalui new village mengikut laluan yang sama dengan tali penyiaran 33kv yang sudah wujud pemilik dan penduduk new village itu telah membuat bantahan terhadap cadangan ini pada bulan jun 2007 perayu telah mengeluarkan notis di bawah 13 akta kepada respondenresponden responden telah memfailkan permohonan di dalam mahkamah tinggi untuk kajian semula kehakiman untuk membatalkan keputusan perayu dalam mengeluarkan notis untuk membuat deklarasi notis adalah tidak sah dan terbatal dan untuk satu injunksi menahan perayu dari menjalankan kerjakerja yang telah dicadangkan di bawah 13 akta respondenresponden menghujah bahawa perayu telah berlindung di sebalik ‘ upgrading ’ penyiaran tali yang sudah wujud dan telah mencuba memasuki tanah tersebut dengan motif tidak baik untuk memperolehinya dan tiada pampasan untuk pemerolehan adalah memadai mahkamah tinggi telah menolak permohonan responden mahkamah rayuan telah menterbalikkan keputusan mahkamah tinggi oleh itu rayuan ini soalan undangundang yang utama yang berbangkit adalah mengenai interpretasi perkataan ‘ upgrading ’ dalam 13 akta diputuskan membenarkan rayuan dengan kos oleh augustine paul hmp menyampaikan penghakiman majoriti mahkamah 1 seksyen 13 akta mesti dibaca dan difahami dalam konteks tujuan ia diperbuat iaitu untuk memenuhi kepentingan orang ramai di dalam membekalkan kuasa elektrik pada harga yang munasabah keperluan pembekalan kuasa elektrik akan meningkat dari masa ke masa dengan penduduk semakin bertambah dan pembangunan perusahaan keperluankeperluan tersebut hanya boleh dipenuhi dengan perubahanperubahan yang perlu dilakukan di dalam pemasangan kuasa elektrik yang kemungkinan perubahan yang amat ketara kegunaan perkataan “ upgrading ” dalam 13 akta menyokong pendapat bahawa latihan peningkatan boleh pergi ke manamana tahap 2 ketigatiga perkataan di dalam 13 akta “ maintain ” “ repair ” dan “ upgrade ” membawa makna yang berlainan dan berbeza setiap satu adalah lain dari yang lain oleh itu ia tidak boleh diperkatakan bahawa makna ketigatiga perkataan adalah b c e f g h 2010 2 clj b tenaga nasional bhd v ong see teong anor 5 analogus atau sama seterusnya prinsip noscitur sociis tiada kegunaannya di dalam penentuan makna perkataan ‘ ’ upgrading ” dalam 13 akta 3 kerjakerja yang telah dicadang oleh perayu dengan jelasnya adalah untuk mempertingkatkan dengan penggantian komponen dan untuk membangkitkan mutu kabel elektrik oleh itu ia jatuh di bawah definisi “ upgrading ” di dalam 13 akta oleh james foong hmp menentang c e f g h 1 perkataan “ upgrading ” dalam 13 akta mesti dibaca dalam konteks dua tujuan yang lain yang disebut di dalam seksyen yang sama “ maintaining ” dan “ repairing ” perkataan sebelumnya “ purpose ” di dalam 13 tidak menandakan bahawa tiga tujuan “ maintaining ” ‘ ’ repairing ” dan “ upgrading ” boleh berdiri sendiri 2 dalam membuat interpretasi perkataan tertentu di dalam seksyen perundangan tertentu ia adalah penting untuk melihat tujuan peruntukan secara keseluruhannya dan bukan dengan cara berasingan tujuan 13 akta adalah untuk membenarkan perayu memasuki tanah tersebut untuk penyenggaraan memperbetulkan dan mempertingkatkan pemasangan berlesen ia bukanlah untuk membuat perubahan penuh pemasangan berlesen 3 struktur yang telah dicadang dan penentuan kepanjangan penyiaran tali dipasang melalui tanah tersebut adalah terlalu luas jika dibandingkan dengan yang sedia wujud ia memerlukan pemindahan struktur yang sedia ada dan digantikan dengan konfigurasi yang amat ketara untuk menanggung kabel penyiaran yang lebih berat dari yang tersedia sekarang ini bukan merupakan peningkatan upgrading kerja yang dicadang adalah pemasangan sesuatu yang baru ia melampaui tahap yang boleh dipertimbangkan sebagai peningkatan dari rumusan perkataan tersebut dalam konteks
