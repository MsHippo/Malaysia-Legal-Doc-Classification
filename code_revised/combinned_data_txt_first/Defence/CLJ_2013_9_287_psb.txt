establish defence right private defence exception 2 300 penal code paras 209 232 bahasa malaysia translation headnotes perayuperayu telah disabitkan dan dijatuhkan hukuman mati kerana membunuh seorang lelaki berumur 27 tahun ‘ si mati ’ yang merupakan rakan sejenayah dalam urusan harta yang dicuri saksi utama pendakwaan adalah pemilik gerai ‘ pw9 ’ yang memaklumkan kepada mahkamah bahawa perayuperayu yang dikenalinya telah ke gerainya pada awal pagi meminta pertolongan daripadanya untuk mendapatkan semula daripada si mati bahagian hasil jualan barangan yang mereka curi pw9 bersetuju untuk menolong dengan meminta upah sebagai pulangan salah seorang perayu menelefon si mati agar bertemu dengan mereka di gerai tersebut dan kemudian pergi mengambil barangan yang dicuri apabila si mati tiba dengan kereta perayuperayu dan pw9 masuk ke dalam kereta dan mereka kemudiannya ke suatu tempat terpencil kononnya untuk mengambil barangan yang dicuri tersebut realitinya tiada barangan yang dicuri dan ia hanyalah helah untuk membawa si mati ke tempat tersebut pw9 menyatakan bahawa selepas mereka keluar daripada kereta dan dia menanyakan si mati mengenai wang yang dihutanginya daripada perayuperayu perayu kedua tibatiba memukul si mati pada kepalanya dengan kayu pemukul besbol yang mana pw9 telah lihat dikeluarkan oleh perayu kedua dari bawah tempat duduk pemandu kereta pw9 menyatakan bahawa perayu pertama bersenjatakan parang turut serta dalam serangan ke atas si mati yang rebah ke tanah tidak bergerak selepas dipukul beberapa kali oleh perayuperayu pw9 menyatakan lagi bahawa dia dan perayuperayu kemudiannya meninggalkan tempat kejadian dengan kereta dan kembali ke gerai selepas mengambil telefon bimbit yang telah diberikan oleh perayuperayu kepadanya pw9 menyatakan bahawa perayuperayu kembali ke gerainya sejurus kemudian untuk memberitahu bahawa si mati telah meninggal dunia tiga hari selepas kejadian tersebut pw9 menyatakan bahawa perayuperayu datang lagi ke gerainya dan memerlukan bantuannya untuk menjual komputer yang telah dicuri mereka menaiki kereta si mati ke rengit di batu pahat untuk tujuan ini tetapi mendapati bahawa kedai yang mana mereka boleh menjual barangan tersebut ditutup sementara menunggu di dalam kereta dua orang pegawai polis yang sedang bertugas telah mendekati mereka pegawaipegawai tersebut curiga apabila melihat komputer tersebut dan mempercayai bahawa ia telah dicuri menangkap perayuperayu dan pw9 dan membawa mereka ke balai polis rengit di mana mereka telah ditahan dan dimasukkan dalam lokap mereka seterusnya diserahkan kepada pegawai penyiasat bagi kes pembunuhan si mati laporan bedah b c e f g h 2013 9 clj b c e f mahadzir yusof anor v pp 291 siasat menunjukkan bahawa terdapat 23 kecederaan luaran pada badan si mati dan keretakan tengkorak walaupun kayu pemukul besbol tidak ditemui sebilah parang dikemukakan di mahkamah dengan kesan darah yang sama dengan jenis darah si mati dalam pembelaan mereka perayuperayu menghujahkan bahawa mereka sekadar mencederakan si mati sebagai pertahanan diri kerana pada asalnya si matilah yang cuba menyerang mereka dengan kayu pemukul besbol apabila dia menjadi marah akibat ditanya mengenai wang yang dihutanginya daripada mereka perayuperayu menghujahkan bahawa apabila perayu kedua merampas kayu pemukul tersebut daripada si mati si mati cuba menyerang mereka dengan parang tetapi dalam pergelutan tersebut perayu kedua memukul si mati pada kepalanya sebanyak dua kali dengan kayu pemukul besbol dihujahkan bahawa perayu pertama tidak pernah menyerang si mati dan cuma seorang pemerhati sepanjang kejadian mahkamah tinggi menolak kes pembelaan dan memutuskan antara lain bahawa tiada sebab untuk si mati bersenjata apabila dia keluar dari kereta kerana tujuan kesemua mereka pergi ke tempat kejadian tersebut adalah untuk mengambil barangan yang dicuri mahkamah tinggi memutuskan bahawa pw9 bukanlah rakan sejenayah oleh itu rayuan ini isuisu yang timbul untuk diputuskan oleh mahkamah adalah sama ada pw9 adalah rakan sejenayah sama ada selamat untuk bersandarkan pada keterangan pw9 yang tidak disokong sama ada perayuperayu mempunyai niat bersama untuk membunuh akibat tidak menjumpai kayu pemukul besbol dan sama ada perayuperayu berjaya membuktikan pembelaan pertahanan diri diputuskan menolak rayuan dan mengesahkan sabitan dan hukuman oleh zainun ali hmr 1 pw9 adalah rakan sejenayah walau bagaimanapun di bawah 133 akta keterangan 1950 keterangannya boleh diterima walaupun tidak disokong g h 2 jelas terdapat niat bersama antara perayuperayu untuk melakukan kesalahan tersebut mereka berniat untuk menyebabkan kecederaan badan pada si mati yang mencukupi dalam keadaan biasa untuk menyebabkan kematian 3 mahkamah tinggi betul dalam memutuskan bahawa perayuperayu telah gagal membuktikan pembelaan pertahanan diri terhadap bangkitan marah besar dan mengejut melihat pada kecederaankecederaan yang dialami oleh si mati yang telah dikenakan bukan sekali tetapi berkalikali menggunakan kekerasan penuh tidak boleh dikatakan bahawa perayuperayu bertindak mempertahankan diri mereka jelas bertindak melampaui apa yang dibenarkan jika pun dilakukan demi mempertahankan diri 292 current law journal 2013 9 clj 4 keterangan adalah teramat banyak bahawa kayu pemukul besbol yang mana tidak ditemui telah digunakan untuk menyebabkan kematian si mati keterangan menunjukkan bahawa punca kematian adalah akibat objek tumpul berkemungkinan kayu pemukul tersebut penggunaan kayu pemukul tidak pernah disangkal oleh perayuperayu b oleh hishamudin mohd yunus hmr menyetujui 1 pw9 adalah rakan sejenayah perayuperayu adalah adil untuk membuat kesimpulan bahawa terdapat rancangan yang telah diatur oleh perayuperayu untuk menyebabkan kecederaan kepada si mati di tempat di mana mereka membawanya dan berkemungkinan besar pw9 tahu mengenai perancangan ini kerana itulah tidak kelihatan pelik padanya apabila dia melihat perayu kedua mengeluarkan kayu pemukul besbol daripada kereta dan mengapa dia tidak marah dengan perayuperayu atas apa yang telah mereka lakukan dan mengapa dia menerima telefon bimbit daripada mereka tanpa teragakagak 2 keterangan pw9 disokong dalam aspekaspek material oleh keterangan bebas seperti oleh pw4 yang telah menjumpai mayat si mati dan melaporkannya kepada polis pw5 isteri si mati dan pemilik kereta pw8 pegawai polis yang telah menangkap mereka bertiga di rengit pw13 pegawai penyiasat kes tersebut pw14 doktor yang menjalankan bedah siasat dan ekshibitekshibit parang laporan kimia tiga alas kaki kereta yang dibuang dan gambargambar kereta tersebut 3 hakim bicara adalah betul dalam dapatan bahawa terdapat niat bersama antara perayuperayu untuk melakukan pembunuhan dan bahawa mereka gagal membuktikan pembelaan hak

melindungi dirinya sifat dan taburan kecederaan simati menunjukkan kejadian tidak berlaku seperti naratif okt1 dan okt2 sekiranya benar apa yang dikatakan oleh okt2 bahawa beliau cuma memukul simati 2
