dijatuhkan hukuman mati di bawah 302 kanun keseksaan atas pembunuhan seorang jully martin ‘ si mati ’ di peringkat perbicaraan bedah siasat yang telah dijalankan ke atas si mati menunjukkan bahawa punca kematian adalah luka tikaman pada bahagian dada daripada sejumlah 54 kecederaan pada badan si mati manakala perayu pula telah dirawat untuk luka serenjang berukuran 1sm di tengahtengah bahagian lehernya dna perayu telah dijumpai pada seluar pendek yang dipakai si mati dan juga pada keratan kuku si mati perayu telah mengemukakan pembelaan bahawa walaupun dia terlibat dalam pergaduhan dengan si mati si mati yang telah menikamnya dahulu dan lukaluka yang telah dikenakan pada si mati hanyalah akibat daripada perbuatan perayu mempertahankan dirinya dalam pergaduhan tersebut hakim mahkamah tinggi telah menolak pembelaan tersebut dan membuat pemerhatian bahawa faktafakta kes lebih konsisten dengan si mati yang bertindak mempertahankan dirinya dengan mengalami sebegitu banyak kesan luka dan perayu merupakan si penyerang yang hanya mengalami luka pada bahagian leher dan tapak tangan dalam pergaduhan tersebut perayu merayu terhadap sabitan dan hukuman tersebut dengan menimbulkan isu sama ada dia mempunyai niat untuk menyebabkan kecederaan tubuh yang memadai dalam perjalanan biasa untuk menyebabkan kematian si mati keterangan utama berkaitan niat adalah jumlah luka dan ii keterangan pw14 yang menjalinkan hubungan dengan perayu setelah memutuskan hubungannya dengan si mati keputusan membenarkan rayuan mengenepikan sabitan dan hukuman oleh abdul wahab patail hmr menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah h 1 mahkamah tinggi gagal mempertimbangkan bahawa terdapat perbezaan antara mempertahankan diri yang membatalkan niat dan mempertahankan diri di bawah kanun keseksaan dan telah menggunakan keduadua istilah secara bertukar ganti pembelaan mempertahankan diri perlu dibuktikan atas imbangan kebarangkalian sedangkan perayu hanya perlu menimbulkan keraguan munasabah sama ada dia mempunyai niat untuk menyebabkan kematian atau kecederaan tubuh yang dimaksudkan untuk mematahkan syarat keempat pertuduhan iaitu niat dalam kes ini 892 current law journal 2015 2 clj pendakwaan tidak menunjukkan sebarang usaha untuk memperincikan pada titik manakah keduadua kecederaan parah yang telah menembusi paruparu si mati konsisten dengan niat untuk membunuh atau menyebabkan kecederaan tubuh yang memadai dalam perjalanan biasa untuk menyebabkan kematian tanpa mengesahkan perkara yang sama ia sekurangkurangnya boleh dianggap bahawa kecederaan tersebut telah dikenakan dalam perbuatan mempertahankan diri dan tanpa niat untuk menyebabkan kematian kesimpulan yang lebih liberal sepatutnya dibuat bagi pihak perayu bahawa pendakwaan telah gagal untuk membuktikan kes seperti yang dikehendaki di bawah 180 kanun keseksaan perayu tidak sepatutnya dipanggil untuk memasukkan pembelaan 2 terdapat 54 kecederaan yang telah dikenakan terhadap si mati dua daripadanya berupaya untuk menyebabkan kematian di mana ia boleh menerangkan perbuatan mempertahankan diri mahupun satu serangan oleh perayu memandangkan terdapat dua atau lebih kesimpulan yang boleh dibuat berdasarkan keterangan tersebut mahkamah tinggi sepatutnya memberikan kesimpulan yang lebih menyokong bahawa perayu tiada niat untuk menyebabkan kematian atau kecederaan tubuh yang memadai dalam perjalanan biasa untuk menyebabkan kematian 3 alasan untuk menolak jawapan sp14 pada peringkat pemeriksaan balas yang bersetuju bahawa sms yang telah dihantar kepada perayu oleh si mati mengandungi ugutan bunuh adalah cacat ia bergantung pada pendakwaan untuk bertanyakan apakah yang sebenarnya telah dikatakan dalam sms tersebut ketiadaan sebarang keterangan yang mencadangkan bahawa si mati telah melakukan sebarang tindakan antara januari hingga mei 2007 untuk menjalankan ugutannya seperti yang didakwa juga tidak boleh dijadikan sebab untuk menolak dakwaan bahawa satu pergaduhan telah berlaku kerana bahagian pertimbangan tersebut adalah pada peringkat pendakwaan dan sebelum perayu mendapat peluang untuk mengemukakan keterangannya sendiri hal ini bukan sahaja meletakkan beban ke atas perayu tetapi mengharapkan keterangannya sebelum dia dipanggil untuk memasukkan pembelaan 4 fakta bahawa si mati masih memegang kunci bilik sp14 membawa kepada inferens bahawa hubungan antara mereka belum tamat dan masih berterusan dan dengan mendapati perayu juga masih pergi ke bilik sp14 merupakan sebab untuk pergaduhan oleh sebab itu testimoni sp14 sepatutnya diperiksa dengan teliti terutamanya sama ada ia selamat untuk dipercayai tetapi hal ini telah dilepas pandang oleh mahkamah tinggi dan diterima bulatbulat b c e f g h 2015 2 clj b c e f g h ommar yacob v pp 5 pembelaan mempertahankan diri memerlukan pembuktian pada imbangan kebarangkalian kekhilafan berlaku apabila beban tersebut dianggap bukan satu beban yang berat sememangnya beban pembuktian pada imbangan kebarangkalian tidaklah seberat pembuktian melebihi keraguan munasabah namun begitu apa yang seakanakan terlepas dari pandangan mahkamah tinggi adalah bahawa apa yang sedang dipertimbangkan adalah pembelaan dan bukannya pendakwaan kes pembelaan adalah bahawa perayu bertindak hanyalah dalam mempertahankan dirinya yang mana menidakkan pembentukan sebarang niat untuk menyebabkan kematian atau kecederaan yang memadai dalam perjalanan biasa untuk menyebabkan kematian yang memerlukan perayu menimbulkan keraguan munasabah mahkamah tinggi telah mengguna pakai standard yang lebih tinggi daripada yang dikehendaki oleh undangundang dan telah gagal untuk mengikuti kes undangundang yang mantap bahawa apa yang patut dipertimbangkan adalah sama ada pembelaan telah menimbulkan keraguan munasabah dan bukanlah sama ada ia boleh dipercayai atau tidak pertimbangannya di sini sepatutnya adalah sama ada pembelaan perayu bukan sahaja berkemungkinan tetapi mempunyai kebarangkalian yang tinggi cases referred ali tan abdullah
