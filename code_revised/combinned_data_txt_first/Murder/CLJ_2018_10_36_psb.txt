dipertuduh bawah 302 kanun keseksaan kerana membunuh kekasihnya di akhir perbicaraan mahkamah tinggi mensabitkan perayu dan menjatuhkan hukuman mati terkilan perayu merayu rayuan perayu adalah bahawa dia tidak siuman dan dua pakar psikiatri dw1 dan dw2 dipanggil memberi keterangan dalam keterangannya dw1 menyatakan bahawa semasa insiden tersebut perayu tidak waras dan tidak berupaya mengetahui tindakannya salah atau melanggar undangundang disebabkan oleh kecelaruan episod kemurungan major yang dialaminya pada ketika itu yang mengganggu fungsi kognitifnya menjejaskan pertimbangan dan mengurangkan kapasiti mentalnya dw2 menyatakan bahawa perayu mengalami gangguan tekanan pasca trauma sebaliknya pihak pendakwaan memanggil pw26 untuk mematahkan keterangan dw1 dan dw2 pw26 memberi keterangan walaupun perayu mengalami kecelaruan episod kemurungan proses pemikirannya koheren dan dia masih berfikiran lojik dan rasional pw26 juga menyatakan bahawa perayu separa waras dan tidak waras pada ketika itu dan mungkin telah mengalami keadaan ketidakwarasan sementara yang menjejaskan pertimbangannya dengan teruk dan mungkin menganggap bahawa dia benar apabila membunuh mangsa dalam rayuannya dihujahkan bahawa pesuruhjaya kehakiman ‘ pk ’ terkhilaf dalam dapatan beliau dan khususnya merujuk pada keterangan dw1 yang menunjukkan ketakupayaan mental perayu untuk mengetahui bahawa apa yang dilakukannya salah atau melanggar undangundang seperti yang diperlukan bawah 84 kanun keseksaan isu yang diketengahkan di mahkamah adalah sama ada perayu tidak siuman dari segi undangundang atau secara perubatan 38 current law journal 2018 10 clj diputuskan menolak rayuan mengesahkan sabitan dan hukuman mati perayu oleh rhodzariah bujang hmr menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah 1 sebelum perbicaraan bermula perayu dihantar ke hospital bahagia oleh mahkamah atas permohonan pendakwaan untuk menentukan keadaan fikiran perayu sama ada dia layak dibicarakan laporan dw1 jelas menyatakan bahawa perayu layak dibicarakan selanjutnya dw1 yang disenaraikan sebagai saksi pihak pendakwaan ditawarkan oleh pihak pendakwaan kepada pembelaan di akhir kes pendakwaan oleh itu tiada cubaan untuk menyekat keterangan oleh pihak pendakwaan seperti yang didakwa oleh pembelaan selanjutnya inferens bertentangan bawah 114g akta keterangan 1950 tidak boleh dibangkitkan terhadap pihak pendakwaan kerana tiada sekatan keterangan penting 2 pesuruhjaya kehakiman memutuskan berdasarkan emel yang ditulis oleh perayu hanya beberapa jam sebelum pembunuhan bahawa perayu mempunyai motif untuk membunuh mangsa kerana tanggapan bahawa mangsa mahu bersama lelaki lain motif dan kewarasan fikiran yang ditunjukkan hanya beberapa jam sebelum melakukan kesalahan menyangkal rayuan ketakwarasan pesuruhjaya kehakiman juga mempertimbangkan keterangan senjata pembunuhan pisau bukan dari rumah di mana kejadian tersebut berlaku oleh itu inferens yang dibuat adalah bahawa perayu membawa pisau tersebut bersamasamanya dan ini menunjukkan rancangan terlebih dahulu untuk melakukan kesalahan selanjutnya terdapat perbezaan pendapat antara pakarpakar tentang ketakupayaan mental perayu dan berikutan pemeriksaan semasa pw26 berbanding dw1 dan dw2 tidak boleh dinafikan bahawa pendapat pakar beliau mengenai perayu sememangnya keterangan yang nilainya lebih berat untuk dipertimbangkan mahkamah cases
