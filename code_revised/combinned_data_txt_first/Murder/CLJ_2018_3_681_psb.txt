keseksaan ‘ kanun ’ seorang bernama teh wai toong ‘ si mati ’ kes pendakwaan adalah bahawa kakak si mati ‘ pw26 ’ menerima mesej dari telefon bimbit si mati pada 21 april 2007 sehari selepas dia keluar dari rumahnya menyatakan bahawa dia ke pulau pinang dengan kawankawannya dan akan pulang pada 23 april 2007 panggilan pw26 ke telefon bimbit si mati tidak berjawab pada 23 april 2007 pw26 menerima mesej dari telefon bimbit si mati bahawa dia telah pergi menemui seorang bernama dolphine dan akan pulang ke rumah kirakira 930 malam kemudian pw26 menerima panggilan dari telefon bimbit si mati dan pemanggil yang berbahasa kantonis memberitahu kepadanya bahawa si mati berada dalam tangannya dan memberi amaran supaya tidak melaporkan kepada pihak polis walau bagaimanapun pada hari yang sama pw26 membuat laporan polis pada 24 april 2006 pw26 menerima mesej meminta dia menyediakan wang tunai sejumlah rm200000 pw26 terus menerima beberapa lagi mesej pada keesokan harinya dan kemudian pada 26 april 2007 pw26 menerima mesej menuntut rm200000 sebagai ganti pengembalian si mati pemanggil itu juga memberikan arahan bagaimana dan bila wang tersebut perlu f g h 2018 3 clj b c e f g h chew wai keong anor v pp another appeal 687 diserahkan pada malam 29 april 2007 pw26 mengikuti arahanarahan yang diberi melalui telefon bimbit si mati mengenai lokasi di mana wang tebusan perlu diserahkan walau bagaimanapun pemanggil yang kerap menukar lokasi penghantaran wang itu menghentikan panggilan dan penghantaran wang tidak dilakukan selepas itu penculik tidak lagi menghubungi jasad si mati ditemui dibuang di kawasan buangan sampah pada 29 april 2007 pakar patologi ‘ pw18 ’ yang melakukan bedah siasat mengesahkan bahawa sebab kematian adalah kesukaran bernafas akibat pengumpulan darah di paruparu kerana pendarahan akibat kecederaan tulang muka pihak pendakwaan mengemukakan keterangan pengecaman melalui pw11 dan pw12 masingmasing jurujual dan juruwang di jaya jusco ipoh yang mengecam perayu kedua sebagai orang yang datang membeli kamera mudah guna sony dan pencetak canon pada 21 april 2007 dan membayar belian tersebut dengan kad kredit atas nama si mati hari berikutnya perayu kedua datang lagi dan membeli beberapa barang termasuk anak patung beruang pw12 memberikan keterangan bahawa dia boleh mengecam perayu kedua kerana dia memakai topi hitam dan jaket biru yang luntur pada keduadua hari tersebut dalam pembelaan mereka pada asasnya perayuperayu menafikan penglibatan dalam pelakuan kesalahankesalahan tersebut mereka mengakui bahawa mereka menyewa sebuah rumah di bercham ‘ rumah bercham ’ untuk tujuan perniagaan membaiki dan servis komputer walau bagaimanapun keduadua mereka menafikan pergi ke rumah itu pada 20 april 2007 hingga 29 april 2007 kerana menurut perayu pertama tiada pesanan daripada pelanggan mereka untuk membaiki komputer keduadua mereka membangkitkan pembelaan alibi dan menghujahkan bahawa pelaku jenayahjenayah tersebut besar kemungkinannya adalah dolphine kerana pada masa material dolphine mempunyai akses ke rumah bercham hakim mahkamah tinggi mendapati perayuperayu bersalah dan mereka disabitkan dan dijatuhkan hukuman mati bagi setiap pertuduhan rayuanrayuan mereka ke mahkamah rayuan ditolak oleh itu rayuanrayuan ini rayuan terhadap perayu pertama dibatalkan kerana perayu pertama meninggal dunia sebelum rayuan bermula berkaitan dengan pertuduhan membunuh dihujahkan bagi perayu kedua bahawa hakim bicara gagal mempertimbangkan apakah tindakan yang dikatakan telah mengakibatkan kecederaan yang mencukupi dalam penjalanan biasa untuk menyebabkan kematian ii ketiadaan keterangan dna atau keterangan lain yang menunjukkan terdapat kaitan penyebaban antara perayu kedua dan kecederaan yang mengakibatkan kematian si mati dan iii kewujudan dna perayu kedua pada rambut yang ditemui di rumah bercham tidak cukup untuk membuktikan dia membunuh si mati selanjutnya dihujahkan bahawa pendakwaan gagal membuktikan bahawa perayu kedua ada di tempat kejadian pada masa jenayahjenayah tersebut dilakukan dan bahawa terdapat pelan aturan terdahulu bersama yang melibatkan perayu kedua 688 current law journal 2018 3 clj diputuskan menolak rayuan terhadap sabitan dan hukuman atas keduadua pertuduhan mengesahkan sabitan dan hukuman mati yang dijatuhkan oleh mahkamah tinggi dan disahkan mahkamah rayuan oleh aziah ali hmp menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah 1 2 3 inti pati penghujahan pembelaan di hadapan hakim bicara adalah bahawa keterangan pw18 menjadikan sebab kematian terbuka pada beberapa anggapan kerana pw18 telah mengakui dalam pemeriksaan balas bahawa terdapat kecederaankecederaan lain tidak semestinya kecederaan pada muka yang menyumbang pada kematian si mati walaupun hakim bicara tidak menyatakan tindakan yang mengakibatkan kecederaankecederaan muka secara spesifik dengan menerima keterangan pw18 tentang sebab kematian melalui implikasi yang perlu hakim bicara juga menerima pendapat pw18 tentang apa yang mengakibatkan kecederaankecederaan muka oleh itu tidak benar untuk mengatakan bahawa hakim bicara gagal mempertimbangkan isu actus reus pada penutup keterangannya dapatan pw18 bahawa kecederaankecederaan muka diakibatkan oleh daya kekuatan menggunakan objek tumpul kekal tidak berubah kepatahan tulang dan pendarahan dalaman mengakibatkan darah mengalir ke saluran pernafasan si mati tidak boleh bernafas membawa pada kematiannya atas keterangan kecederaankecederaan tulang muka diakibatkan oleh daya yang kuat pada muka si mati dalam keadaan tersebut tindakan yang mengakibatkan kecederaan muka terangkum dalam peruntukan bahagian c 300 kanun selanjutnya keterangan pw18 menunjukkan bahawa dia tidak menemui apaapa indikasi bahawa si mati mengalami apaapa kesakitan atau kecacatan fizikal yang mencadangkan kematiannya mungkin diakibatkan oleh sebabsebab lain sebaliknya laporannya menunjukkan bahawa si mati adalah orang muda yang sihat pw26 dan pw32 bapa si mati yang merupakan ahli keluarga terdekat si mati juga tidak disoal balas mengenai keadaan kesihatan si mati pihak pendakwaan melalui keterangan saksisaksi telah membuktikan bahawa si mati diculik untuk wang tebusan terdapat keterangan yang cukup banyak bahawa si mati ditahan secara paksa dan secara salah kewujudan dna pada beberapa ekshibit yang diambil dari rumah bercham khususnya seluar pendeknya dan resit dari tejani medical services sdn bhd atas namanya menguatkan kes pendakwaan bahawa rumah bercham adalah tempat kesalahankesalahan tersebut dilakukan b c e f g h 2018 3 clj 689 4 dalam kes di mana pendakwaan bergantung secara penuh atau secara substansial atas keterangan pengecaman tertuduh mahkamah perlu mempertimbangkan panduan yang dinyatakan dalam kes r v turnbull others apabila menilai kualiti keterangan pengecaman ‘ panduan turnbull ’ pendapat hakim bicara mengenai kebolehpercayaan saksi mesti diberi beban dan pertimbangan sewajarnya mahkamah di peringkat rayuan tidak boleh mengganggu dapatan sedemikian yang dicapai hakim bicara yang mempunyai kelebihan pandang dengar saksi kecuali terdapat sebab yang sebenar dan meyakinkan untuk tidak menyetujui walaupun hakim bicara tidak menyatakan panduan turnbull dalam alasan penghakimannya beliau telah mempertimbangkan keterangan dan hal keadaan sedia ada apabila menilai keterangan pengecaman perayu kedua pw11 dan pw12 adalah saksisaksi yang boleh dipercayai dan keterangan pengecaman perayu kedua oleh mereka sebagai orang yang menggunakan kad kredit si mati di jaya jusco ipoh boleh diterima dengan selamat 5 pihak pendakwaan telah membuktikan bahawa perayu kedua yang menggunakan kad kredit si mati pada 21 dan 22 april 2007 di jaya jusco ipoh untuk membeli kamera mudah guna dan anak patung beruang yang didapati daripada perayu kedua dapatan ini mematahkan hujahan perayu kedua bahawa dolphine yang menggunakan kad kredit si mati untuk membeli kamera mudah guna di jaya jusco ipoh keterangan bahawa perayu kedua mempunyai kad kredit dalam milikannya membuktikan kaitan antara perayu kedua dan si mati ini menunjukkan bahawa dari 21 april 2007 dia mempunyai akses dan kawalan atas si mati keterangan bahawa dia menggunakan kad kredit si mati bagi tujuannya sendiri menunjukkan bahawa perayu kedua boleh menggunakan kuasa terhadap si mati anggapan tak boleh sangkal yang timbul daripada keterangan ini adalah dia mengetahui bahawa si mati telah diculik dan dikurung di rumah bercham keterangan ini menunjukkan kebersalahannya dalam penculikan si mati 6 keterangan perayu kedua menunjukkan bahawa dari masa mereka mula menyewa rumah tersebut pada 9 april 2007 sehingga 16 april 2007 tarikh yang dinyatakannya sebagai hari akhir komputer terakhir dibaiki dia telah membaiki dan servis kirakira 23 komputer oleh itu keputusan hakim bicara untuk tidak menerima penjelasan perayu pertama bahawa tiada komputer untuk dibaiki atau servis antara 18 dan 29 april 2007 bukan tidak munasabah aneh jika tibatiba dari 18 april 2007 tiada komputer untuk dibaiki atau servis 7 pw27 menyatakan bahawa dia tidak boleh melakukan profil dna daripada beberapa ekshibit ini bermaksud bahawa tiada profil dna yang didapati daripada sampelsampel tersebut untuk dianalisis oleh pw27 mentafsirkan kenyataan itu sebagai bermaksud bahawa b c e f g h chew wai keong anor v pp another appeal 690 current law journal 2018 3 clj terdapat kemungkinan dna orang yang tidak dikenali atau dolphine mungkin terdapat dalam sampel tersebut adalah salah representasi maksud kenyataan itu 8 9 10 11 hakim bicara mendapati keterangan kakak perayu kedua dw4 tidak menyokong pembelaan alibinya hakim bicara menerima keterangan dw4 dan bukan keterangan ibu perayu kedua dw5 hakim bicara yang mempunyai kelebihan mendengar dan melihat berhak berbuat demikian walaupun terdapat kesilapan pada rekod berkaitan rujukan terhadap saksi alibi tiada kemudaratan berlaku pada pembelaan perayu kedua pembelaan alibi gagal membangkitkan keraguan munasabah dalam kes pendakwaan kegagalan pihak polis menyiasat notis alibi tidak memprejudis pembelaan perayu kedua saksisaksi alibi adalah ahli keluarga terdekat perayu kedua jika penyiasatan dilakukan dan kenyataankenyataan yang direkodkan daripada saksisaksi ini dijalankan adalah munasabah untuk mengharapkan bahawa apaapa kenyataan yang mereka mungkin berikan tidak akan berbeza daripada keterangan mereka di mahkamah sebaliknya kegagalan pihak polis menyiasat notis alibi menafikan pihak pendakwaan peluang mematahkan keterangan alibi memberi kelebihan kepada perayu kedua untuk mengguna pakai 34 kanun kehadiran di tempat kejadian jenayah tidak diperlukan tetapi kehadiran di situ bagi tujuan memudahkan atau membantu kesalahan itu sendiri membentuk penyertaan sebenar dalam tindakan jenayah tersebut penting bahawa perlu ada keterangan niat bersama atau keterangan yang daripadanya anggapan niat bersama untuk melakukan kesalahan yang sebenarnya telah dilakukan boleh sewajarnya dibuat dalam kes ini hakim bicara mendapati bahawa keterangan ikut keadaan yang dikemukakan membuktikan tanpa keraguan munasabah bahawa keduadua perayu adalah orang yang melakukan keduadua kesalahan tersebut dalam lanjutan niat bersama keduadua mereka terdapat keterangan yang mencukupi untuk menunjukkan bahawa keduadua perayu bertindak bersama untuk menculik si mati dan kemudian membunuhnya perayu pertama dan kedua berkawan perayu pertama mengenali si mati perayu kedua memberikan keterangan bahawa dia tidak mengenali si mati oleh itu kemungkinan yang munasabah bagaimana perayu kedua memiliki kad kredit si mati adalah dia diberi kad itu oleh perayu pertama tindakan menyewa rumah bercham adalah pelan yang diatur terdahulu sewaan rumah itu bermula dari 9 april 2007 kirakira dua minggu kemudian si mati diculik penggunaan kad kredit si mati bersamasama dengan b c e f g h 2018 3 clj 12 c e f 691 penemuan kamera mudah guna dan anak patung beruang menunjukkan perayu kedua bersubahat dengan perayu pertama dalam melakukan jenayah itu oleh itu tiada merit dalam rayuan perayu kedua dan sabitannya selamat b chew wai keong anor v pp another appeal walaupun dolphine dikatakan adalah pelaku sebenar jenayah tersebut dalam pembelaan perayuperayu polis tidak dimaklumkan pada bilabila masa tentang dolphine juga tiada soalan dikemukakan kepada manamana saksi pendakwaan bahawa dolphine adalah orang yang telah melakukan jenayahjenayah itu selanjutnya cadangan bahawa dolphine adalah pelaku jenayah hanya timbul pada peringkat pembelaan perayu pertama menggambarkan dolphine tetapi butirbutir yang diberikan dalam keterangannya amat tidak lengkap untuk membawa apaapa makna dengan itu pembelaan tersebut adalah fikiran terkemudian pengemukaan versi yang lewat ini sememangnya melemahkan kredibiliti perayuperayu walaupun dolphine wujud tiada keterangan untuk mengaitkan dia dengan jenayahjenayah itu kecuali dakwaandakwaan yang dibuat perayuperayu cases referred amri ibrahim anor v pp 2017 1 clj
