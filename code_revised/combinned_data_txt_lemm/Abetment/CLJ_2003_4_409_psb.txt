dirasuah  untuk  membuat  tuduhan  tersebut  terhadap  perayu  pertama  tidak  terdapat  sebarang  asas  untuk  tidak  mempersetujui  keputusan  hakim  bicara  kerana  kebolehpercayaan  seseorang  saksi  adalah  perkara  yang  terletak  terutamanya  kepada  hakim  bicara  tambahan  pula  azizan  menafikan  membuat  pendedahan  sedemikian  16  tidak  terdapat  sebarang  konspirasi  politik  terhadap  perayu  pertama  tindakan  azizan  meminta  nasihat  peguam  pada  masa  matan  dan  ketidakwujudan  pematahan  dari  perayu  pertama  meruntuhkan  sebarang  teori  rekaan  pada  pihak  azizan  17  walaupun  hakim  bicara  tidak  secara  khusus  mempertimbangkan  mengapa  azizan  tidak  membuat  laporan  polis  terdahulunya  beliau  mendapati  azizan  seorang  saksi  yang  jujur  setelah  mendengar  dan  melihat  beliau  di  dalam  kandang  saksi  dan  juga  atas  alasanalasan  lain  oleh  yang  demikian  ianya  boleh  dianggap  bahawa  hakim  bicara  telah  mengambilkira  isu  ini  sebelum  mencapai  keputusan  beliau  walaupun  begitu  kegagalan  untuk  membuat  laporan  polis  tidak  memudaratkan  pendakwaan  dan  ianya  bukanlah  sesuatu  prasyarat  untuk  memulakan  penyiasatan  polis  18  oleh  kerana  penjelasan  azizan  balik  bekerja  semula  dengan  isteri  perayu  pertama  walaupun  telah  diliwat  tidak  dipatahkan  ianya  dapat  diterima  sebagai
