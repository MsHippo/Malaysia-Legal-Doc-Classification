The appellant was a licencee under s. 9 of the Electricity Supply
Act 1990 (‘the Act’). The respondents were proprietors and/or
occupiers of respective plots of land (“said land”) in a new village
known as Kampung Sungai Terentang, Rawang, Selangor (‘New
Village’). In 1974, LLN (appellant’s predecessor) installed steel
poles on the said land to carry a 33 kV transmission line which
ran across the New Village. In 1986, the State Government of
Selangor alienated the said land to respondents. Around 2005, the
appellant implemented a project which required a high voltage grid
with a capacity of 270 kV to be installed through the New Village
along the same path as the existing 33 kV transmission line. The
owners and residents of the New Village protested against this
proposal. In June 2007, the appellant issued a notice in pursuant
to s. 13 of the Act to the respondents. The respondents filed an
application in the High Court for a judicial review to quash the
appellant’s decision in issuing the said notice; to declare the notice
null and void; and for an injunction restraining the appellant from
carrying out the proposed works under s. 13 of the Act. The
respondents claimed that the appellant had under the guise of
“upgrading” the existing transmission line attempted to enter into
the said land with an ulterior motive to acquire it and no
compensation for such acquisition was ever adequate. The High
Court dismissed the respondent’s application. The Court of Appeal
reversed the decision of the High Court. Hence, this appeal. The
principal question raised was in relation to the interpretation the
word “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act.

Held (allowing the appeal with costs)
Per Augustine Paul FCJ delivering the majority judgment of
the court:
(1) Section 13 of the Act must be read and understood in the
context of the purpose for which it was enacted, that is to
say, to serve the interests of the public in the supply of
electricity at reasonable prices. The need for electricity supply
will increase from time to time with the rising population and
industrial development. Such needs can be met only with
changes in the electrical installations which can be even of a
very major nature. The unqualified use of the word
“upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act supports the view that an
upgrading exercise can go to any extent. (para 8)
(2) The three words in s. 13 of the Act (“maintain”, “repair” and
“upgrade”) carry separate and distinct meanings; each is
different from the other. It cannot therefore be said that the

meanings of the three words are analogous or similar.
Therefore, the principle of noscitur a sociis has no application
in the determination of the meaning of the word “upgrading”
in s. 13 of the Act. (para 10)
(3) The proposed works undertaken by the appellant were clearly
an improvement by the replacement of components and was a
raising in rank of the electricity cables and therefore fell within
the definition of “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act. (para 18)
Per James Foong FCJ (dissenting):
(1) The word “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act must be read in
the context of the two other purposes mentioned in the same
section: “maintaining” and “repairing”. The preceding words
“for the purpose” found in s. 13 do not imply that the three
purposes: maintaining, repairing and upgrading stand on their
own. (para 43)
(2) In interpreting a particular word in a certain section of a
legislation, it is imperative to look at the intention of the
provision as a whole rather than in isolation. The intention of
s. 13 of the Act is to allow the appellant to enter into the
said land for the purpose of maintaining, repairing or upgrading
the licenced installation; it is not for effecting an entire change
to the licenced installation. (para 45)
(3) The proposed structure and the extent of the transmission line
to be laid across the said land was exceedingly extensive as
compared to the existing. It involved the removal of the entire
existing structure and be replaced by an enormous
configuration to uphold weightier transmission cables than the
present. This did not constitute upgrading. The proposed
work was an installation of something totally new. It exceeded
the degree that can be considered as upgrading by the
common sense of the word read in the context of the other
two purposes: “maintaining” and “repairing”. (paras 47 & 48)

yang melalui New Village. Pada tahun 1986, kerajaan negeri
Selangor telah berimilik tanah tersebut kepada respondenresponden. Pada sekitar tahun 2005, perayu telah menjalankan
projek yang memerlukan grid voltan tinggi dengan kebolehan
270kV untuk dipasang melalui New Village mengikut laluan yang
sama dengan tali penyiaran 33kV yang sudah wujud. Pemilik dan
penduduk New Village itu telah membuat bantahan terhadap
cadangan ini. Pada bulan Jun 2007, perayu telah mengeluarkan
notis di bawah s. 13 Akta kepada responden-responden.
Responden telah memfailkan permohonan di dalam Mahkamah
Tinggi untuk kajian semula kehakiman untuk membatalkan
keputusan perayu dalam mengeluarkan notis; untuk membuat
deklarasi notis adalah tidak sah dan terbatal; dan untuk satu
injunksi menahan perayu dari menjalankan kerja-kerja yang telah
dicadangkan di bawah s. 13 Akta. Responden-responden
menghujah bahawa perayu telah berlindung di sebalik ‘upgrading’
penyiaran tali yang sudah wujud dan telah mencuba memasuki
tanah tersebut dengan motif tidak baik untuk memperolehinya dan
tiada pampasan untuk pemerolehan adalah memadai. Mahkamah
Tinggi telah menolak permohonan responden. Mahkamah Rayuan
telah menterbalikkan keputusan Mahkamah Tinggi. Oleh itu, rayuan
ini. Soalan undang-undang yang utama yang berbangkit adalah
mengenai interpretasi perkataan ‘upgrading’ dalam s. 13 Akta.
Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan dengan kos)
Oleh Augustine Paul HMP menyampaikan penghakiman
majoriti mahkamah:
(1) Seksyen 13 Akta mesti dibaca dan difahami dalam konteks
tujuan ia diperbuat, iaitu, untuk memenuhi kepentingan orang
ramai di dalam membekalkan kuasa elektrik pada harga yang
munasabah. Keperluan pembekalan kuasa elektrik akan
meningkat dari masa ke masa dengan penduduk semakin
bertambah dan pembangunan perusahaan. Keperluan-keperluan
tersebut hanya boleh dipenuhi dengan perubahan-perubahan
yang perlu dilakukan di dalam pemasangan kuasa elektrik yang
kemungkinan perubahan yang amat ketara. Kegunaan
perkataan “upgrading” dalam s. 13 Akta menyokong pendapat
bahawa latihan peningkatan boleh pergi ke mana-mana tahap.
(2) Ketiga-tiga perkataan di dalam s. 13 Akta (“maintain”, “repair”
dan “upgrade”) membawa makna yang berlainan dan berbeza;
setiap satu adalah lain dari yang lain. Oleh itu, ia tidak boleh
diperkatakan bahawa makna ketiga-tiga perkataan adalah

analogus atau sama. Seterusnya, prinsip noscitur a sociis tiada
kegunaannya di dalam penentuan makna perkataan
‘’upgrading” dalam s. 13 Akta.
(3) Kerja-kerja yang telah dicadang oleh perayu dengan jelasnya
adalah untuk mempertingkatkan dengan penggantian komponen
dan untuk membangkitkan mutu kabel elektrik, oleh itu ia jatuh
di bawah definisi “upgrading” di dalam s. 13 Akta.
Oleh James Foong HMP (menentang):

D

E

G

H

I

(1) Perkataan “upgrading” dalam s. 13 Akta mesti dibaca dalam
konteks dua tujuan yang lain yang disebut di dalam seksyen
yang sama : “maintaining” dan “repairing”. Perkataan
sebelumnya “for the purpose” di dalam s. 13 tidak
menandakan bahawa tiga tujuan: “maintaining”, ‘’repairing” dan
“upgrading” boleh berdiri sendiri.
(2) Dalam membuat interpretasi perkataan tertentu di dalam
seksyen perundangan tertentu, ia adalah penting untuk melihat
tujuan peruntukan secara keseluruhannya dan bukan dengan
cara berasingan. Tujuan s. 13 Akta adalah untuk membenarkan
perayu memasuki tanah tersebut untuk penyenggaraan,
memperbetulkan dan mempertingkatkan pemasangan berlesen;
ia bukanlah untuk membuat perubahan penuh pemasangan
berlesen.
(3) Struktur yang telah dicadang dan penentuan kepanjangan
penyiaran tali dipasang melalui tanah tersebut adalah terlalu
luas jika dibandingkan dengan yang sedia wujud. Ia
memerlukan pemindahan struktur yang sedia ada dan
digantikan dengan konfigurasi yang amat ketara untuk
menanggung kabel penyiaran yang lebih berat dari yang
tersedia sekarang. Ini bukan merupakan peningkatan
(upgrading). Kerja yang dicadang adalah pemasangan sesuatu
yang baru. Ia melampaui tahap yang boleh dipertimbangkan
sebagai peningkatan dari rumusan perkataan tersebut dalam
konteks dua tujuan yang lain: “maintaining” dan “repairing.”

JUDGMENT

A

Augustine Paul FCJ:

B

[1] The facts of the case have been sufficiently dealt with in the
judgment of my learned brother James Foong FCJ and it is
superfluous for me to repeat them.
[2] The appellants had been granted leave to appeal to the
Federal Court on eight questions of law. They are as follows:

C

D

E

(1) Whether s. 13 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 (“the Act”)
is subject to the implied limitation that not all manner of
upgrading works may be carried out by Tenaga Nasional Bhd.
on existing installations under that provision?
(2) Whether s. 13 of the Act is subject to a qualitative assessment
of the type of upgrading works intended to be carried out on
existing installations so that ‘major’ works are to be excluded?
(3) Whether the determination of whether the works are ‘major’
or not is suitable for decision by a court of law as opposed
to the public body in whose technical judgment Parliament has
reposed the carrying out of upgrading works?
(4) Whether s. 13 of the Act is limited in application to only
upgrading works in the nature of repairs and maintenance?

F

G

H

I

(5) Whether the public purpose factor necessitates that s. 13 of
the Act be read purposefully in order that the contemplated
works could be carried out expeditiously in the public interest?
(6) Whether the compensation payable to affected landowners
under s. 13 read with s. 16 of the Act on a ‘full
compensation’ basis is meant to be inferior to compensation
payable under the Land Acquisition Act 1960?
(7) Whether art. 13 of the Federal Constitution is breached
where the injury to property is caused by works authorized
under a written law providing for ‘full compensation’ to
affected landowners?
(8) Whether art. 13 of the Federal Constitution is breached
where the injury to land is an interference or “deprivation”
authorized by written law?



8

Current Law Journal

[2010] 2 CLJ

As submitted by the appellants the questions may be classified as
follows:

A

1. The proper construction of s. 13 of the Act. This is contained
in Question Nos 1-5.
2. The payment of compensation under s. 13 read with s. 16 of
the Act and art. 13 of the Federal Constitution. This is
contained in Question Nos 6-8.
[3]

B

I shall now consider the two classifications.
C

The First Classification
[4] This relates essentially to the meaning to be accorded to the
word “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act which reads as follows:
Whenever it is necessary so to do for the purpose of maintaining,
repairing or upgrading any licensed installation or any part thereof,
the licensee, or any person authorized by him in that behalf, may
at all reasonable times enter upon any land on, under or over
which supply lines have been laid, placed or carried, or upon
which posts or other equipment have been erected, and may carry
out all necessary repairs, and may, in the course thereof, fell or
lop trees, remove vegetation and do all other things necessary to
the said purpose, causing as little damage as possible and paying
full compensation in accordance with section 16 to all persons
interested for any damage that may be caused thereby for which
compensation has not already been assessed under section 11.

[5] In order to ascertain whether the works carried out by the
appellants amount to an ‘upgrading” within the scope of s. 13 of
the Act, it is first necessary to determine the meaning of the
word. It is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as follows:

D

E

F

G

1. Raise in rank etc. 2. Improve (equipment, machinery, etc.)
esp.by replacing components.

The word as defined refers to the raising in rank or improvement
of equipment, machinery etc especially by replacing components,
obviously for the purpose of better or increased performance.
However, the meaning does not appear to be subject to any
limitation or qualification. That may require a wide interpretation
to be given to the word which may, needless to say, cause
problems and hardship to some. The critical issue for
determination is whether the word “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act
must be accorded this meaning even though it may result in
individual hardship.

H

I



[2010] 2 CLJ

A

Tenaga Nasional Bhd v.
Ong See Teong & Anor

9

[6] This raises the question of whether the meaning of the word
“upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act is capable of being restricted in
order to avoid the hardship. That brings into focus s. 17A of the
Interpretation Acts 1948 of 1967 (“s. 17A”) which reads as
follows:

B

In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that
would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether
that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall
be preferred to a construction that would not promote that
purpose or object.
C

D

E

F

G

H

I

It is thus abundantly clear that what must prevail is a construction
that will promote the purpose of an Act. In this regard useful
reference may be made to Mills v. Meeking [1990] 91 ALR 16
where Dawson J in explaining s. 35(a) of the Interpretation of
Legislation Act of Victoria which is similar to s. 17A said at
pp. 30 - 31:
The literal rule of construction, whatever the qualifications with
which it is expressed, must give way to a statutory injunction to
prefer a construction which would promote the purpose of an Act
to one which would not, especially where that purpose is set out
in the Act. Section 35 of the Interpretation of Legislation Act
must, I think, mean that the purposes stated in Pt 5 of the Road
Safety Act are to be taken into account in construing the
provisions of that Part, not only where those provisions on
their face offer more than one construction, but also in
determining whether more than one construction is open.
The requirement that a court look to the purpose or object of the
Act is thus more than an instruction to adopt the traditional
mischief or purpose rule in preference to the literal rule of
construction. The mischief or purpose rule required an ambiguity
or inconsistency before a court could have regard to purpose:
Miller v. Commonwealth [1904] 1 CLR 668 at 674; Wacal
Developments Pty Ltd v. Realty Development Pty Ltd [1978] 20 ALR
621 at 630. The approach required by s. 35 needs no ambiguity
or inconsistency; it allows a court to consider the purposes of an
Act in determining whether there is more than one possible
construction. Reference to the purposes may reveal that the
draftsman has inadvertently overlooked something which he would
have dealt with had his attention been drawn to it and if it is
possible as a matter of construction to repair the defect, then this
must be done. However, if the literal meaning of a provision is



10

Current Law Journal

[2010] 2 CLJ

to be modified by reference to the purposes of the Act, the
modification must be precisely identifiable as that which is
necessary to effectuate those purposes and it must be consistent
with the wording otherwise adopted by the draftsman. Section 35
requires a court to construe an Act, not to rewrite it, in the light
of its purposes. (emphasis added.)

A

B

In commenting on provisions similar to s. 17A in the Australian
States Statutory Interpretation in Australia by Pearce and Geddes 4th
edn says at p. 27:
In the author’s opinion, however, s. 15 AA requires the purpose
or object to be taken into account if the meaning of the words,
interpreted in the context of the rest of the Act is clear. When
the purpose or object is brought into account, an alternative
interpretation of the words may become apparent. And if one
interpretation does not promote the purpose or object of an Act
and another interpretation does so, the latter interpretation must
be adopted.

[7] A matter of immediate concern is therefore the ascertainment
of the purpose of the Act. There can be no dispute that s. 13 of
the Act merely authorizes the doing of the acts specified therein
for the purpose of the Act. The purpose can be gathered from
the preamble to the Act which reads as follows:
An Act to provide for the appointment and functions of a Director
General of Electricity Supply, the supply of electricity at reasonable
prices, the licensing of electrical installation and the control of
electrical installation, plant and equipment with respect to matters
relating to safety of persons and for purposes connected
therewith.

Thus the purpose of the Act is, inter alia, to ensure the supply of
electricity at reasonable prices to the public at large. Where a
purpose serves the general interest of the community it is a public
purpose (see S Kulasingam & Anor v. Commissioner of Lands, Federal
Territory & Ors [1982] CLJ 65; [1982] CLJ (Rep) 314). As the
purpose of the Act is to serve the interests of the public in the
supply of electricity it is for a public purpose. Where the public
interest is involved the balance of convenience in favour of the
public in general must be looked at more widely (see Tenaga
Nasional Bhd v. Dolomite Industrial Park Sdn Bhd [2000] 1 CLJ
695). Thus individual hardship that may arise in giving the
necessary interpretation to a statutory provision cannot be a
relevant matter for consideration. As Principles of Statutory
Interpretation by GP Singh 10th Edn says at pp. 133 - 134:

It is often found that laws enacted for the general advantage do
result in individual hardship; for example laws of limitation,
Registration, Attestation although enacted for the public benefit,
may work injustice in particular cases but that is hardly any
reason to depart from the normal rule to relieve the supposed
hardship or injustice in such cases. ‘It is the duty of all courts of
justice’, said Lord Campbell, ‘to take care for the general good
of the community, that hard cases do not make bad law’.

It is perhaps necessary to bear in mind the observation made in
State of Punjab v. Okara Grain Buyers Syndicate Ltd AIR 1964 SC
669 that a bare mechanical interpretation of the words and
application of a legislative intent devoid of concept of purpose will
reduce most of the remedial and beneficent legislation to futility.
In R (on the application of Quintavalk) v. Secretary of State for Health
[2003] 2 All ER 113 Lord Bingham said at p. 113:

Every statute other than a pure consolidating statute is, after all,
enacted to make some change, or address some problem, or
remove some blemish or effect some improvement in the national
life. The court’s task, within the permissible bounds of
interpretation, is to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. So the
controversial provisions should be read in the context of the
statute as a whole and the statute as a whole should be read in
the historical context of the situation which led to its enactment.

[8] It follows that s. 13 of the Act must be read and
understood in the context of the purpose for which it was
enacted, that is to say, to serve the interests of the public in the
supply of electricity at reasonable prices. There can be no dispute
that the need for electricity supply will increase from time to time
with the rising population and industrial development. Advances in
science and technology may help to maintain prices at a
reasonable level in the supply of electricity. Such needs can be met
only with changes in the electrical installations which can be even
of a very major nature. The unqualified use of the word
“upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act supports the view that an
upgrading exercise can go to any extent. If it was the intention of
Parliament to limit the degree of “upgrading” that can be carried
out then words to achieve that object would have been used as
in the case of the New Zealand electrical laws. The Reserve
Management Act 1991 of New Zealand is subject to district plans
when electricity cables are sought to be laid for the conveying of
electricity. In Transpower New Zealand v. Taupo District Council
[2008] NZRMA 41 the district plan for Taupo which specifically
provided for only “minor upgrading of existing … support structure



12

for conveying electricity” was in issue. It was held that the
proposed tower extensions of up to 5.5 meters in height for the
scheduled upgrading of the existing electricity transmission line was
not a “ … minor upgrade … .” Thus as Baragwanath J said in
that case:

A

B

The decision whether an excess over these stipulated heights is
more than ‘minor’ is a matter of evaluation containing a
substantial element of factual judgment.

The approach adopted in the restrictive interpretation of the New
Zealand provision can be discerned with ease. While the New
Zealand provision is limited to only “minor upgrading” there is no
such limitation or qualification to “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act.
The meaning of “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act is therefore not a
matter of factual determination having considered the materials or
components to be added or changed. It is thus not subject to any
qualification and may go to any extent even though it may cause
individual hardship. The result is that any restriction imposed in
the meaning to be accorded to the word “upgrading” in s. 13 of
the Act will conflict with the purpose of the Act in the supply of
electricity to the public and thereby be in violation of s. 17A.
[9] Be that as it may, a matter that requires to be addressed is
whether it can be argued that the purpose of enacting section 13
of the Act is to give it a restricted meaning by the application of
the principle of noscitur a sociis as the word “upgrading” appears
with two other words, that is to say, “maintaining” and
“repairing”. The meanings of these two words in s. 13 of the Act
must be considered before resorting to the principle of noscitur a
sociis. This is a necessary pre-condition to be satisfied before the
principle of noscitur a sociis can be invoked. In this regard
reference may be made to Bindra’s Interpretation of Statutes 9th Ed
which says at p. 677:
The meaning of a word is to be judged by the company it keeps.
It is a legitimate rule of construction to construe words in an Act
of Parliament with reference to words found in immediate
connection with them. But before the principle of noscitur a sociis
can be pressed into service, it must be shown that the words are
employed in the same sense or that they are susceptible of
analogous meaning (Lokmat Newspapers Put Ltd v. Shankar Prasad
[1999] 6 SCC 275).

[10] I will now consider the meanings of the three words in
question in s. 13 of the Act in order to determine whether they
are analogous or similar in nature. The Concise Oxford Dictionary
defines the word “maintain” as:
4. Preserve or provide for the preservation of (a building,
machine, road, etc) in good repair.

And the word “repair” as:

C

1. Restore to good condition after damage or wear. 2. Renovate
or mend by replacing or fixing parts or by compensating for
loss or exhaustion. 3. set right or make amends for (loss,
wrong, error, etc.).

And the word “upgrade” as:
D

E

F

G

H

I

raise in rank etc. 2. Improve (equipment, machinery, etc.), esp.
by replacing components.

It must be observed that the meaning of the word “maintain”
carries with it the element of repair. This has been recognized in
cases such as Cross v. Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council [1998]
1 All ER 564 where it was held that “maintain” includes “repair”.
As “maintain” and “repair” have been enacted as separate items
in s. 13 of the Act the meaning of the word “maintain” must be
deemed to exclude the element of repair. It thus refers to only the
act of supervising to ensure that a thing is preserved for the
purpose for which it was designed. It therefore does not involve
the carrying out of any physical work. The word “repair” refers
to the restoration of something to a good condition after it has
been damaged. The amount of restoration work that is needed
may vary from case to case. The word “upgrade” is quite different
from “repair” as it refers to the raising in rank or improvement by
replacing components, obviously, for the purpose of better
performance. It will thus be observed that all the three words in
s. 13 of the Act carry separate and distinct meanings; each is
different from the other. It cannot therefore be said that the
meanings of the three words are analogous or similar. The result
is that the principle of noscitur a sociis has no application in the
determination of the meaning of the word “upgrading” in s. 13 of
the Act. It must be added that even if it is held that the principle
of noscitur a sociis is indeed applicable the resultant restricted
meaning to be given to the word “upgrading” will not have the
effect of promoting the purpose underlying the Act with the result
that the wider meaning to be accorded to the word must be
adopted.

[11] I am therefore of the view that the word “upgrading” in
s. 13 of the Act must be given its natural and ordinary meaning
as defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary to which reference has
been made in an earlier part of this judgment. This meaning
accords with the purpose of the Act.

B

[12] My response to the five questions under this classification
shall therefore be as follows:
(a) Question No. 1
Whether s. 13 of the Act is subject to the implied limitation
that not all manner of upgrading works may be carried out by
Tenaga Nasional Bhd on existing installations under that
provision?

C

[13] Section 13 of the Act is not subject to any implied limitation
in carrying out any upgrading works on existing installations by
Tenaga Nasional Bhd. It must, however, relate to the raising in
rank or improvement of equipment, machinery etc especially by
replacing components of electrical installations, obviously for the
purpose of better or increased performance.

D

E

(b) Question No. 2
Whether s. 13 of the Act is subject to a qualitative assessment
of the type of upgrading works intended to be carried out on
existing installations so that “major” works are to be excluded?

F

[14] Section 13 of the Act is not subject to any qualitative
assessment of the type of upgrading works intended to be carried
out on existing installations with the result that “major” works are
not excluded.

(c) Question No. 3
Whether the determination of whether the works are “major”
or not is suitable for decision by a court of law as opposed
to the public body in whose technical judgment Parliament has
reposed the carrying out of upgrading works?

Whether the public purpose factor necessitates that s. 13 of
the Act be read purposefully in order that the contemplated

[18] Having answered the questions it is appropriate to consider
whether the proposed works to be undertaken by the appellants
fall within the definition of “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act It is
the intention of the appellants to replace the 33 kV transmission
lines with more extensive 275 kV cables with different steel poles
for the purpose of increasing the supply of electricity. In cases
such as United States v. 3.6 Acres of Land, F Supp 2d 982 and
Edgcomb v. Lower Valley Power and Light Inc 922 Pacific Reporter
2d Series 850 it was held that increasing the capacity of
transmission lines is to be regarded as an upgrading exercise. In
Rolland v. International Transmission Co 2008 Mich App Lexis 996
it was held that upgrading may involve altering the pole structures
carrying the transmission lines for the purpose of upgrading. The
proposed works are therefore clearly an improvement by the
replacement of components and is a raising in rank of the
electricity cables and therefore fall within the definition of
“upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act. This conclusion accords with the
answers to Question Nos 1 and 5.

be entitled to full compensation for the loss of use of their lands
to the extent of the loss pursuant to art. 13 of the Federal

Introduction
[26] The appellant was granted leave by the Federal Court to
pose eight questions of law. During the hearing of this appeal, the
appellant’s counsel submitted that these questions can be
condensed to two. I agree with him. The first and the principal
question requires this Court to interpret the word “upgrading” in
s. 13 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 (the Act). The second

relates to the payment of compensation under s. 13 read with
s. 16 of the Act and art. 13 of the Federal Constitution. But
before I proceed with this, knowledge of the factual background
of this case is necessary.
[27] The appellant is a licencee under s. 9 of the Act and is the
successor of Lembaga Letrik Negara (LLN) by virtue of the
Electricity Supply (Successor Company) Act 1990. As this is the
case, there is no dispute that the appellant is to be treated as an
“administrative body” whose decision is subject to judicial review
under O. 53 r. 3 of the Rules of High Court 1980 (RHC).
[28] The respondents by themselves and by those they represent
are proprietors and/or occupiers of respective plots of land
(collectively referred to as the said land) in a new village known
as Kampung Sungei Terentang, Rawang, Selangor (New Village).
According to them, they and/or their predecessors had settled in
this New Village since 1940 under the British Colonial
administrative directive known as the Briggs Plan. Temporary
occupation licences were issued to them to occupy the said land.
Sometime in 1974, LLN installed steel poles on the said land to
carry a 33 kV transmission line which ran across the New Village.
No one in the village objected to this at the material time.
[29] In 1986, the State Government of Selangor alienated the
said land to respondents but in its document of title there is no
endorsement of any agreement (technically known as “wayleave
agreement”) between the respondents and LLN to allow the
electricity supply line to run across the said land.
[30] Around 2005, the appellant decided to implement a project
known as Central Area Reinforcement Project (CAR project) to
increase electricity supply to Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley.
This was undertaken as a result of a severe electricity disruption
on 13 January 2005 which affected the central region of
Peninsular Malaysia. To implement this project, a high voltage grid
with a capacity of 270 kV covering a distance of 60 kilometers
from a place called Bukit Tarek to another known as Cudadak
had to be installed. A section of the route for this grid runs
through the New Village along the same path as the existing
33 kV transmission line. Presently, the appellant has completed
this project at both ends except for a 1.5 kilometer stretch
through the New Village.

[2010] 2 CLJ

[31] The owners and residents of the New Villager protested
against this proposal and implementation. They attempted to
persuade the appellant to find an alternative route. Unfortunately,
after many meetings between the parties, political party
representatives and the State authority, this request was turned
down. Eventually, in June 2007, the appellant issued a notice in
pursuant to s. 13 of the Act to the respondents.

the licensee, or any person authorized by him in that behalf, may
at all reasonable times enter upon any land on, under or over
which supply lines have been laid, placed or carried, or upon
which posts or other equipment have been erected, and may carry
out all necessary repairs, and may, in the course thereof, fell or
lop trees, remove vegetation and do all other things necessary to
the said purpose, causing as little damage as possible and paying
full compensation in accordance with section 16 to all persons
interested for any damage that may be caused thereby for which
compensation has not already been assessed under section 11.

[34] Responding to this, the respondents filed an application in
the High Court at Kuala Lumpur for a judicial review under
O. 53 r. 3 RHC of the appellant’s decision to issue the said
notice under s. 13 of the Act. In this application they sought:

(i) an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the appellant in
issuing the notice under s. 13 of the Act;
I

(ii) a declaration that the notice issued under s. 13 of the Act is
null and void; and
(iii) an injunction restraining the appellant from carrying out the
works proposed in the notice issued under s. 13 of the Act.



20

Current Law Journal

[2010] 2 CLJ

[35] The pertinent ground raised by the respondents in support
of this application is that the appellant had intentionally under the
guise of “upgrading” the existing transmission line attempted to
enter into the said land with an ulterior motive to acquire it and
no compensation for such acquisition is ever adequate.

A

B

[36] The High Court, subsequent to granting leave to file this
application for judicial review, rejected it after an inter parte hearing.
The reason (relevant to the first question posed to this court) is
this:
The wording of s. 13 is clear, the exercise of the Respondent
(the appellant before this Court) is only conditioned for the
purpose of maintaining, repairing or upgrading any license
installation or any part thereof. In the absence of any conclusive
evidence tendered by the Applicants (the respondent before this
Court) showing otherwise, this Court (is) left with no room but
to accept that the current posts were installed validly. In this
premise, the natural conclusion would be that the issuance of
s. 13 Notice was perfectly within the procedure envisaged for its
current purpose of upgrading the transmission line from 33kV to
275 kV.

[37] Dissatisfied with this decision, the respondents lodged an
appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal reversed the
decision of the High Court and granted the respondents an order
for certiorari to quash the decision of the appellant in issuing the
notice under s. 13 of the Act. The ground proffered by the Court
of Appeal relevant to the first question posed to this court is this:
Let us analyse the neutral evidence adduced which comes in the
form of the tendered pictures (RR 550 to 554). These pictures
highlight the difference in sizes between an LLN 33kV post (an
original post) and the gigantic new TNB 275kV transmission
tower. It would be impossible to put on paper the indescribable
and perpetual fear the appellants would have to undergo, either
imagined or real, if they have to live under the giant pylons that
overhang their houses day in and day out after the construction
is completed. Needless to say prior to the completion of these
structures the appellants would already have a taste of the future
bitter sufferings when they have to put up with the huge
machineries and other infractions by the workers of the
respondent. From pages 555-562 are seen the effect of fallen
pylons and the hazard that go with it. Evidence adduced also
confirmed the negative medical effect on people, especially children
who are more susceptible to leukemia and like diseases, when
bombarded by the flow of electricity passing over their houses ...

With such a mega project in the offing, and the eventual
repercussion pervading the lives of the appellants being so major,
this panel was unable to agree with the stance of the respondent
or the finding of the learned judge. This was not just tightening
of the loose screws repainting the posts, replacing the aging posts
with new but similar types of structure, which could be accepted
as upgrading, but an exercise that would witness a major
emplacement of the transmission lines together with the structures
holding them, and affecting the area involved in no uncertain
terms. How could it be construed that the exercise of the
respondent was to repair and maintain the existing posts in the
ordinary sense, when the new superstructures, which would
radically and fundamentally alter the landscape are now the
permanent features (A.C.T Construction Ltd v. Customs and Excise
Commissioners [1981] 1 WLR 1542). The previous posts would see
no repairs being undertaken but totally dismantled and replaced,
and a large area of the appellants’ land by necessity, encroached
when the mega project has been completed. A major upheaval in
the health and lives of the appellants would undoubtedly be
witnessed thereafter.

Analysis
E

F

G

H

I

[38] To begin, I must be reminded that the respondents’
application before the High Court is for judicial review on a
decision made by an administrative body. It is common ground
between the parties that in such proceedings, the court will not
conduct an examination into the merit of the decision but rather
to the decision-making process unless the decision is illegal,
irrational, made with procedural impropriety and disproportionate
– R Rama Chandran v. The Industrial Court of Malaysia [1997]
1 CLJ 147. As both the High Court and the Court of Appeal had
adhered to this principle when considering this case there is no
issue of the courts below applying the wrong principle of law.
[39] To justify the appellant’s right to enter into the said land
under s. 13 of the Act, the appellant had to convince the court
that the proposed work to be undertaken on the said land was
for the purpose of “upgrading” the existing facility since it is
neither for “maintenance” or “repairs” (the other two purposes
provided by s. 13 of the Act). Towards this, the appellants’
counsel encouraged this court to adopt a purposive approach in
our interpretation by giving the word “upgrading” a broad and
wide meaning. In support of this contention he cited to us a
number of American cases where the courts have been liberal with
their interpretation of easement rights of utility companies to build

and enhance their electricity lines over individual property rights –
Detroit Edison Company v. John Zoner (163 North Western
Reporter, 2d Series 496), United States v. 3.6 Acres of Land
(F Supp 2d 982), Edgcomb v. Lower Valley Power and Light Inc (922
Pacific Reporter, 2d Series 850).

A

B

[40] Further, he also submitted that this word “upgrading” should
stand on its own and should not be associated with the other
two purposes: “maintaining” and “repair” found in s. 13 of the
Act. Though upgrading may involve elements of repair and
maintenance but because the preceding words of “for the
purpose” it should be read on its own.
[41] My approach to this question is to first examine the major
elements in s. 13 of the Act. This section firstly imposes preconditions on a licencee to enter into any land where there is a
licenced installation and this is: the necessity to do so. And this
necessity must be for the purpose of maintenance, repairs and
upgrading of the licenced installation. After that, upon entry, the
licencee may carry out necessary repairs on the said installation
and in the course of this fell or lop trees, remove vegetation and
do any other thing necessary for this purpose. And finally, the
licencee should cause as little damage as possible in the course of
their work and if there is any damage caused, to compensate the
persons affected.
[42] Since the meaning of the word “upgrading” in s. 13 of the
Act is now in contention, I must point out at the outset that for
the purpose of interpretation of however simple a word is, it is “a
matter of law” (Pearlman v. Keepers And Governors of Harrow School
[1979] 1 QB 56 @ 67). For this, I turn first to the commonly
used Concise Oxford Dictionary for the meaning of the word
“upgrade”. It reads: “1. raise in rank etc. 2. improve (equipment,
machinery, etc.) esp. by replacing components”. Though this is the
true meaning of the word can we accept that this applies without
limitation? Does it mean that as long as there is a rise in the rank
of a thing or an improvement thereto, no matter to what extent
or degree, it would be considered as an upgrade or upgrading?
More relevant to the facts of this case, are we prepared to accept
that a new transmission line with an increase capacity of seven
times that of the current line and requiring a gigantic steel
structure with a wide base to hold it up at regular intervals
upgrading? If we are to look for an answer to these questions, it
must, in my opinion, be narrowed down to a matter of degree.

[43] In some jurisdictions such as in New Zealand, there are
some district legislations which provide that upgrading of existing
electrical power lines be limited to only “minor upgrading” - see
Transpower New Zealand Limited v. Taupo District Council [2008]
NZRMA 41. But even over this, I observe, the requirement of
degree to be determined in order to justify “minor”. This can be
seen from the judgment of Baragwanath J in Transpower New
Zealand Limited v. Taupo District Council (supra) when he said:
The decision whether an excess over those stipulated heights is
more than “minor” is a matter of evaluation containing a
substantial element of factual judgment. The two bodies entrusted
by Parliament with authority to make factual judgments are, at
first instance, the Council and on appeal the Environment Court.
The High Court can interfere only if the decision of the
Environment Court misconstrues the law or reaches a factual
conclusion that is irrational.

[44] I find this approach appealing. The meaning of upgrading
must therefore be a matter of factual determination. In the event
of a dispute between the parties then it is for the court to make
a factual judgment having taken into account the materials or
things to be added or changed. But when considering this, one
must bear in mind that “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act must be
read in the context of the two other purposes mentioned in the
same section: “maintaining” and “repairing”. It is my considered
view that together these three words share a common
characteristic: to do something to an existing matter. They should
therefore not be read in isolation but in the context of each other
since they are shapes of the same colour. The link between these
three words in this section suggests that they should be treated
in the same sense - capulatio verborum indicat acceptationem in eodem
sensu. Consequently, the established principle in the rules of
construction noscitur a sociis applies ie, “the meaning of two or
more words which are receptive to similar meaning can be
considered by consideration of the company in which the words
appear and is associated with.” - see Sykt Perniagaan United Aces
Sdn. Bhd. & Ors v. Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya [1996] 4 CLJ
301. I disagree with the appellant’s counsel’s contention that the
preceding words “for the purpose” found in s. 13 of the Act imply
that the three purposes: maintaining, repairing and upgrading stand
on their own. My view is that since these preceding words are



24

[2010] 2 CLJ

general words which follow particular and specific words of one
genus then it is presumed to be restricted to the same genus as
the particular words. Meaning: the general expression is to be
read as comprehending things of the same kind as that designated
by the preceding particular expression unless there is something to
show that a wider sense was intended - see Public Prosecutor v.
Pengurus Hong Trading & Co [1984] 2 CLJ 67; [1984] 2 CLJ Rep
415 @ 417:
I am further of the view that the words ‘other matter’ found in
reg. 3(v)(ii) of the regulation should be read ejusdem generis with
“Prussian blue, lead or compounds of lead” which according to
the Deputy Public Prosecutor are poisonous or deleterious to the
human body. According to a well established rule of construction
of statutes, general terms following particular ones apply only to
such persons or things as are ejusdem generis with those
comprehended in the language of the legislature. In other words
the general expression is to be read as comprehending things of
the same kind as that designated by the preceding particular
expressions, unless there is something to show that a wider sense
was intended.

[45] Further, when one interprets a particular word in a certain
section of a legislation, it is imperative to look at the intention of
the provision as a whole rather than in isolation - see Tan Sung
Mooi (f) v. Too Miew Kim [1994] 3 CLJ 708. In this instance, the
intention of s. 13 of the Act is to allow the appellant, as licencee,
to enter into the said land by necessity for the purpose of
maintaining, repairing or upgrading the licenced installation; it is
not for effecting an entire change to the licenced installation.
[46] The High Court did not fully consider the facts of this case
from this angle. It accepted a face value the appellant’s proposal
for the CAR Project on the said land as falling within the meaning
of the word “upgrading” found in s. 13 of the Act. The Court of
Appeal however discussed this in depth and came to a conclusion
that the degree of upgrading of the existing line should only be
limited to “just tightening of loose screws, repainting the posts,
replacing the aging posts with new but similar type of structure”.
[47] Judging from the photographs tendered as evidence, the
proposed structure and the extent of the transmission line to be
laid across the said land is exceedingly extensive as compared to
the existing. The current two simple H steel poles holding the 33

kV transmission line have be removed and replaced by a gigantic
steel structure with a broad base reverted to the ground at
demarcated intervals across the New Village to support an even
wider and more extensive 275 kV cables. Judging from the size of
this steel structure, no wonder certain houses on the said land
along the route of the transmission line would have to be
completely demolished to make way. The reason is simple: The
average area for each plot of the said land is only approximately
3000 square feet. So in certain areas the entire plot would be
used to accommodate this colossal structure not forgetting the
provision of a five foot wide pathway beneath the line for ready
access for repairs and maintenance of the new line. So obviously
this is not something to be done to an existing structure. This
involves the removal of the entire existing structure and be
replaced by an enormous configuration to uphold weightier
transmission cables than the present.
[48] Factually, I agree with the Court of Appeal that this does
not constitute upgrading. The proposed work is an installation of
something totally new. It exceeds the degree that can be
considered as upgrading by the common sense of the word read
in the context of the other two purposes: maintaining and
repairing. Though in upgrading one may add something new to it
but here the extent is far too substantial to qualify falling within
this category. I do not agree to the Court of Appeal’s observation
that upgrading in s. 13 of the Act is only limited to tightening
loose screws, repainting or replacing of existing electrical posts.
Each case has to be considered on its own facts and it is
impossible to lay down any universal standard to gauge degree.
But in the circumstances of this case, the so called upgrading far
exceeds the degree that I am prepared to accept as upgrading
within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act.
Competing Interest

H

I

[49] Both parties had attempted to argue on the issue of
competing interest: that of the individual rights of the respondents
against the wider interest of the community for the demand of
electrical power to propel development and which one is
paramount over the other. But in my opinion this is not the forum
to debate and decide on this. The appellant is adequately armed
with relevant provisions in the Act to carry out their proposed

task if they elect to do so such as s. 14(3) of the Act which says
that the appellant can acquire such land as required for the
purpose intended and pay compensation accordingly. It is not for
this court to question such power bestowed on them by the
legislature. I am here only to determine the meaning and extent
of the word “upgrading” in s. 13 of the Act according to the
facts of this case and for this, I have expressed my view.

Payment Of Compensation
[50] The second question posed to this court relates to
payment of compensation under s. 13 read with s. 16 of the
and art. 13 of the Federal Constitution. According to
appellant’s counsel this question arose from a passage in
judgment of the Court of Appeal where it says:

the
Act
the
the

C

This subtle and unconscionable way of driving and depriving the
appellants of their property, hence (sic) in effect an acquisition of
their land by the respondent (a power exercisable only by the
State authority), surely would contravene their constitutional rights
(Article 13 of the Federal Constitution).

D

[51] The appellant took issue that by this statement the Court
of Appeal has failed to consider art. 13 of the Federal
Constitution and the adequate compensation provided to the
affected party under s. 13 read with s. 16 of the Act.

E

[52] Article 13 of the Federal Constitution provides:

F

(1) No person shall be deprived of property save in accordance
with law.
(2) No law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition or use
of property without adequate compensation”.

G

[53] And the compensation provision in s. 13 of the Act reads;
... may at all reasonable times enter upon any land on, under or
over which supply lines have been laid, placed or carried, or upon
which posts or other equipment have been erected, and may carry
out all necessary repairs, and may, in the course thereof, fell or
lop trees, remove vegetation and do all other things necessary to
the said purpose, causing as little damage as possible and paying
full compensation in accordance with section 16 to all persons
interested for any damage that may be caused thereby for which
compensation has not already been assessed under section 11.

[54] As I have effectively ruled against the appellant in their
decision to issue the notice to the respondents under s. 13 of the
Act, this second question on compensation becomes irrelevant and
academic. Thus, there is no necessity for me to dwell into it.
Conclusion
[55] For reasons aforesaid, I would dismiss this appeal with costs
to the respondents. Deposit for this appeal to the respondents
towards account of taxed costs.
