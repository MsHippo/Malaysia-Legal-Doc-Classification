[2]

The two charges read as follows:
“Bahawa kamu pada 23hb Oktober 2013 jam lebih kurang

appellants and the other accused to 10 years of imprisonment from
the date of arrest. Only both the appellants were sentenced to 10
strokes of whipping each in addition to imprisonment. As regards

Dissatisfied with the decision of the learned Sessions Court judge,
the first and second appellant proceeded to file this appeal against
their conviction and sentence. The other accused did not file any
appeal.

THE PROSECUTION’S CASE
[5]

The evidence adduced by the prosecution throughout the trial can
be summarised as follows.

[6]

On 23 October 2013 at about 6.00 p.m, Sub Inspector Muslim bin
Elias (“PW1”) with his team of police officers went to Hotel Samila,
Alor Setar, Kedah. An observation was made for approximately 20
minutes outside Room 312 (“the said room”). The said room was
locked from the inside.

[7]

At around 6.20 p.m., PW1 noticed that somebody was opening the
door and was coming out from the said room. PW1 and his team
immediately proceeded with the raid. PW1 found that the first
appellant was the one coming out from that room and the second
appellant was inside the said room with the other accused.

5



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

[8]

Legal Network Series

PW1 introduced himself as a police officer. PW1 himself
conducted a body search on both the appellants but found nothing
incriminating on them. A further search was conducted in the said
room. PW1 found a plastic bag with the word “Terima Kasih”
written on it (“P7”) on the dressing table in the said room. Upon
examining P7, PW1 found two transparent plastic bags (“P8”) with
contents suspected to be drugs and 20 aluminium foils (“P9A-P”)
containing a total of 200 pills, also suspected to be drugs.
Consequently, all the exhibits were seized. Both the appellants
and the other accused were arrested.

[9]

Both the appellants and the other accused together with all the
seized exhibits were handed over to the investigating officer,
Inspector Ab Halim bin Mohd Sajudi (“PW4”).

[10] The exhibits were sent to the chemist for analysis. It was
confirmed

that

the

exhibits

contained

36.16

Methamphetamine and 40.36 grams of Phenazepam.

THE APPELLANTS’ DEFENCE
[11] Basically the first appellant's defence was that he only booked the
said room on behalf of the second appellant and the other
accused. Therefore, the first appellant claimed that he had neither
knowledge nor custody to the seized drugs and poison.
[12] The second appellant’s defence,on the other hand, was that he
never knew there were drugs and poison in the said room and it
was possible that somebody had planted the drugs and poison in
the said room.
[13] Both the appellants’ versions were consistent. One day before the
raid, the room was booked by the first appellant on his name upon
the request by the second appellant. On the day in question, the
second appellant contacted the first appellant to go out and eat
together with him and the other accused. The first appellant came
to the hotel room around 2.00 p.m. and they all went out around
5.00 p.m. to eat. They came back to the said room at around 6.00
p.m.
[14] Two to three minutes later, the first appellant told the second
appellant that he wanted to go out. Immediately after the first

7



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

appellant opened the door, the police, led by PW1, rushed in. The
second appellant was shown P7 and all the contents. He claimed
that he did not see where the things were recovered by the police.
He also claimed that he never saw the drugs and poison prior to
the raid. The first appellant on the other hand claimed that the
police never showed him anything.
THE APPEAL
[15] Several issues were raised during the appeal. However, upon
careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in the present
case, I am of the view that the main issue is whether the
prosecution had proven the charge against the appellants, in
particular, the element of common intention under section 34 of the
Penal Code as stated in both the charges.
SECTION 34 OF THE PENAL CODE
[16] Section 34 of the Penal Code provides that:

8



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

“When a criminal act is done by several persons, in
furtherance of the common intention of all, each of
such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as
if the act were done by him alone”.
(own emphasis added)
[17] The law on section 34 of the Penal Code in Malaysia is very much
settled. The Federal Court in the case of Low Kian Boon & Anor
v. Public Prosecutor [2010] 4 MLJ 425 dealt with this issue in
great details.
[18] As regards to the elements that must be proven by the prosecution
in invoking this provision, the Federal Court in Low Kian Boon
(supra) made reference to and agreed with the lengthy decision of
the Singapore’s Court of Appeal in Shaiful Edham Bin Adam &
Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1999] 2 SLR 57 where in the exact
words of Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) at p. 59 of the
report, it was held that:“On this view, all that it is necessary for the prosecution to
prove is that there was in existence a common
intention between all the persons involved to commit

9



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

a criminal act and that the act which constituted the
offence charged (the ‘criminal act’ referred to in s. 34
of the Penal Code) was committed in furtherance of
that criminal act. The rider to this is that the
participants must have some knowledge that an act
may be committed which is consistent with or would
be in furtherance of, the common intention”.
(own emphasis added)
[19] See also Mimi Wong & Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1972] 2 MLJ
75, SCCA and Public Prosecutor v. Neoh Bean Chye & Anor
[1975] 1 MLJ 3, SCCA.
[20] What is regarded in law as common intention can be seen
succinctly explained in the Supreme Court case of Namasiyiam
Doraisamy v. Public Prosecutor & Other Cases [1987] CLJ
(Rep) 241 whereby Syed Agil Barakbah SCJ (as he then was) held
at pp. 251of the report that:-

10



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

“In law, common intention requires a prior meeting of
the minds and presupposes some prior concert.
Proof of holding the same intention or of sharing
some other intention, is not enough”.
(own emphasis added)
[21] On the same point, it was noted by Yong Pung How CJ (as he
then was) in Shaiful Edham(supra) that:“The second anal more important point is that the
common intention must precede the criminal act: see,
eg Asogan Ramesh s/o Ramachandren & Ors v. PP
[1998] 1 SLR 286. In this connection, the question is
whether or not there must be found a pre-arranged plan in
determining whether the ‘criminal act’ was done ‘in
furtherance of the common intention’. In Mahbub Shah,
the Privy Council held that common intention implies
the existence of a pre-arranged plan. Sir Madhavan
Nair said at:
… it is clear to their Lordships that common
intention within the meaning of the section

11



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the
accused of an offence applying the section it
should be proved that the criminal act was done
in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As
has been often observed, it is difficult if not
impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the
intention of an individual; in most cases it has to be
inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant
circumstances of the case”.
(own emphasis added)
[22] The prosecution may adduce such evidence of common intention
either by direct or by circumstantial evidence. When circumstantial
evidence is adduced, the evidence proved must lead only to the
inference that there is common intention amongst all the accused.
[23] Again in Namasiyiam Doraisamy (supra), it was further held that:
“There

must

be

proved

either

by

direct

or

by

circumstantial evidence that there was (a) a common
intention to commit the very offence of which the accused

12



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

persons are sought to be convicted and (b) participation
in the commission of the intended offence in furtherance
of that common intention. Where the prosecution case
rest on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances
which are proved must be such as necessarily lead
only to that inference”.
Direct evidence of a prior plan to commit an offence is
not necessary in every case because common intention
may develop on the spot and without any long
interval of time between it and the doing of the act
commonly

intended.

intention may be

In

such

inferred

a

case,

from the

common
facts and

circumstances of the case and the conduct of the
accused. (The Supreme Court (of India) on Criminal Law
(1950-1960) by J.K. Soonavala p. 188 to 193)”.
(own emphasis added)
[24] Another important point to note is that common intention may
develop on the spot and it can be inferred from the facts and
circumstances of the case.

13



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

[25] In Wan Yurillhami Bin Wan Yaacob & Anor v. Public
Prosecutor [2010] 1 MLJ 749, Zulkefli FCJ in delivering the
judgment of the Federal Court had this to say at p. 764 of the
report:
“It is a well established principle of law in dealing with the
criminal liability under s. 34 of the Penal Code that a preconcert or pre-planning may develop on the spot or
during the course of the commission of the offence,
but the crucial test is that such plan must precede the
act

constituting

the

offence.

The

existence

of

common intention is a question of fact and in each
case it may be proved as a matter of inference from
the circumstances of the case (see the cases of
Mahbub Sha v. Emperor AIR 1945 PC 118 and Suresh
v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 2001 SC 1344)”.
(own emphasis added)

14

FINDINGS
[26] Therefore,

based

on

the

abovementioned

principles,

the

prosecution in the present case were required to prove that there
was common intention between both the appellants involved to
commit a criminal act, ie, possession of drugs and poison, and
that the possession of drugs and poison was committed in
furtherance of that common intention. There must also be proof of
pre-concert or pre-planning to establish common intention.
[27] Now that the relevant principles have been laid out, I turn to
consider the submissions by all parties.
[28] The learned counsels for the appellants submitted that the
prosecution had failed to prove the element of common intention
as preferred against the appellants in both charges. There was no
evidence to prove common intention against both the appellants.
[29] The learned DPP then contended that these proven facts ought to
be taken into account by the Court in inferring that there was
common intention amongst the appellants, namely:-

15



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

a.

Legal Network Series

the evidence of PW1 that before the raid he enquired at the front
desk who occupied the said room and he was told that the said
room was occupied by one Malay male, one Chinese male and
another Chinese female;

b.

PW1 was further told that the room was registered under the
name of the first appellant;

c.

the drugs and poison were found on the dressing table inside the
said room while both the appellants and the other accused were
still in the room; and

d.

an observation was made for the whole 20 minutes before the
raid.

[30] The same factors were also taken into consideration by the
learned Sessions Court Judge in finding that there was, in fact,
common intention amongst both the appellants and the other
accused as can be seen at pp. 37-40 of the appeal record.

16



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

[31] In support of her contention, the learned DPP in the present case
then quoted the Federal Court case of Ghazalee Kassim & Ors v.
PP [2009] 4 CLJ 737 and in particular at p. 746 of the report, the
wordings of Zaki Tun Azmi CJ (as he then was) as follows:
“Section 34 of the Penal Code is invoked by the
prosecution in order to prove that although an accused
did not directly commit the criminal act, he was involved
in a series of other acts with the others to show that
he had the common intention of committing that
criminal act with the others. The accused need not be
present together with the others who had committed the
actual criminal act [6]. It is sufficient that he participated
jointly with the others. It must however be shown that
there was a prior arranged plan with the others. In other
words, all those who are charged pursuant to s. 34 of the
Penal Code, must have the common intention to commit
the offence charged”.
[32] However, I am unable to agree with this contention by the learned
DPP. I have gone through at great length the appeal record and
perused all evidence adduced in the present case. I find that there

17



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

is no evidence to show the existence of any common intention
between the appellants to be in possession of the drugs and
poison by reasons stated below.
[33] Firstly, based on the evidence, the prosecution was only able to
prove that the room was registered under the first appellant’s
name. The first appellant explain that the room was booked upon
request by the second appellant for him to stay that night. No other
evidence was adduced for this Court to infer that the room was
booked in furtherance of the appellants’ common intention to be in
possession of the drugs and poison.
[34] Secondly, though it was not denied that when the police raided the
room, both the appellants were inside the room, there was also no
evidence from PW1 of the conduct of the appellants when the
drugs and poison were found by the police to support the learned
DPP’s contention that common intention had developed on the
spot especially at the time when the drugs and poison were found.
[35] As such, I am of the view that the prosecution had failed to prove
common intention as between the appellants in the present case.
There was no evidence in the present case from which common

18



[2015] 1 LNS 1208

Legal Network Series

intention could be inferred. Common intention was an essential
element in the charges preferred against the appellants. Failure to
prove this element is fatal to the prosecution’s case.
CONCLUSION
[36] Based on all of the above, the first and the second appellant
appeal is hereby allowed. The conviction and sentence against
both the appellants are therefore set aside. The appellants are
hereby acquitted and discharged.
