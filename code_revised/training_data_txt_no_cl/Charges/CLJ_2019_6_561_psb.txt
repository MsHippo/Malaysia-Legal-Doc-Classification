10 APRIL 2019
CRIMINAL LAW: Charges – Criminal charges – Proceedings – Applicant, former
Prime Minister of Malaysia, charged with seven criminal charges relating to offences
under Penal Code, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 and
Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful
Activities Act 2001 – Court of Appeal granted order of stay of criminal proceedings

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE: Stay of execution pending appeals – Appeal against
decision of Court of Appeal – Applicant, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, charged
with seven criminal charges – Court of Appeal granted order of stay of criminal
proceedings – Commencement of trial against applicant at High Court stopped
pending disposal of appeals to Federal Court – Whether there were ‘proceeding
pending’ before Federal Court – Whether stay of criminal proceedings same as stay
of civil proceedings – Whether there were exceptional circumstances justifying stay
of proceedings – Whether Court of Appeal correct in allowing applicant’s application
for stay of criminal proceedings – Courts of Judicature Act 1964, ss. 44, 79 & 80
The respondent, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences committed under the Penal Code, the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 and the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.
The present appeals emanated from the decision of the Court of Appeal
granting an order of stay of proceedings, pursuant to ss. 44, 79 and 80 of the
Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (‘CJA’), and consequently, stopping the
commencement of a trial against the respondent at the High Court pending
the disposal of his appeals to the Federal Court. The three appeals pending
before the Federal Court, filed by the respondent, were his failure to
(i) secure a ‘gag order’ restraining publication by members of the public on
matters pertaining to his prosecution and trial; (ii) secure documents other
than those provided under s. 51A of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘CPC’);
and (iii) challenge the withdrawal by the Public Prosecutor (‘the appellant’)
of transfer certificate to transfer the case against the respondent to the
High Court. In essence, the appellant relied on the following grounds of
appeal: (i) staying a criminal trial should be differently treated from staying



562

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

a civil trial; (ii) precedents in civil cases relied by the respondent before the
Court of Appeal, in particular Kosma Palm Oil Mill Sdn Bhd & Ors v. Koperasi
Serbausaha Makmur Bhd (‘the Kosma case’), must be treated with caution in
criminal proceedings; (iii) if trials are statutorily required to commence
within three months, granting a stay would defeat this objective. Stay of a
criminal trial should only be granted on exceptional grounds; that is
sparingly so as not to defeat the purposive object of s. 172B(4) of the CPC
for trials to start in three months; and (iv) if this court is of the view that
special circumstances are the principal consideration in determining an
application for stay of proceedings for criminal trials, the facts in this case
militated against the granting of a stay because no special circumstances
favoured the respondent. On the contrary, these factors indicated that a stay
should be refused: (a) the offences for which the respondent was charged with
were serious in nature; (b) this case was one of public and national
importance as it generated much public interest, locally and internationally;
(c) trial dates were fixed eight months ago, as opposed to the three months
specified under s. 172B(4) of the CPC; and (d) no prejudice would be caused
to the respondent because he would have an early opportunity to vindicate
himself. The respondent argued that the appeal by the appellant was
incompetent since there was no appeal record and no petition filed, as
required by the CJA. The primary issue that arose for adjudication was
whether the Court of Appeal was correct in allowing the respondent’s
application for a stay of the criminal proceedings.
Held (allowing appeal; setting aside stay order by Court of Appeal; and
remitting matter to High Court to proceed with criminal trial)
Per Richard Malanjum CJ delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) Sections 44(1) and 80(1) of the CJA speak of ‘pending proceedings’ as
a pre-requisite before an interim order could be made by the relevant
court. When the stay application was made by the respondent, the Court
of Appeal had already dismissed the three appeals by the respondent. In
the circumstances, there was no longer any ‘pending proceeding’ before
the Court of Appeal enabling it to exercise its jurisdiction to grant a stay
of proceedings under s. 44(1) of the CJA. Similarly, for the respondent
to avail himself of s. 80(1) of the CJA, there must also be a ‘proceeding
pending’ before the Federal Court. When the respondent’s appeals were
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, there was no pending proceeding
before the Federal Court at that stage. There was only an undertaking
by the respondent that he would be filing an appeal. As such, s. 79 of
the CJA was not relevant. (paras 16 & 17)
(2) Sections 44(1) and 80(1) of the CJA did not empower the Court of
Appeal to grant a stay of proceedings. Since the respondent’s reliance on
ss. 44(1) and 80(1) of the CJA failed, it followed that s. 79 of the CJA
was similarly of no assistance to him. The Court of Appeal had no

jurisdiction to entertain the respondent’s application for a stay of
proceedings upon the dismissal of the three appeals. The grant of the stay
was therefore made without jurisdiction and was thus a nullity. (para 17)
(3) The Kosma case represented the legal position governing stays of
execution for civil appeals. In the Kosma case, it was held that the test
applicable to the grant of a ‘stay of execution’ was whether there were
special circumstances, the most common of which is whether the appeal
would be rendered nugatory if a stay of execution is not granted. The
relevant question was whether it applied with equal force to a stay of
criminal proceedings at the trial court when there were pending appeals
in respect of interlocutory applications before the court. (paras 18 & 19)
(4) In considering an application for stay of criminal proceedings, when
commencement of the trial is imminent or continuing in the court of first
instance, the determinative principles are (i) there is a strong public
interest in the prosecution of crime and in ensuring that those charged
with serious criminal offences are tried; (ii) it is undesirable that the
criminal process be interrupted or fragmented by interlocutory
proceedings. The considerations of public interest are of great weight
leaning in favour of expeditious resolution of accusations of crime;
(iii) the undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process is not
confined to any particular part of the criminal process, but rather to the
process as a whole; (iv) a stay of proceedings application would require,
especially, compelling justification in a case qualifying for urgent
judicial decision. For instance, it is important that anyone charged with
serious criminal offences be brought to trial expeditiously. Public
interest would not be served by allowing the defence to request for a
delay. An accused of serious criminal offences, who is not guilty, should
have the opportunity of clearing his name without excessive delay;
(v) a stay of proceedings would not normally be granted pending an
interlocutory appeal in a criminal trial. It is only in very exceptional or
unusual circumstances that a stay order is granted. This is so even if the
issuing of the interlocutory appeal is not opposed by the prosecution or
in fact supported by both the prosecution and the defence; (vi) the
accused’s rights over preliminary or interlocutory rulings made by the
trial judge are best vindicated by appeal after conviction, if any. It is
generally more desirable to consider preliminary or interlocutory
rulings made by the trial judge in appeal after conviction upon full trial
with the benefit of a concrete factual setting than considering them in the
abstract during interlocutory appeal; (vii) the fact that an accused will
be put to the expense of a trial is irrelevant and would not qualify as
‘exceptional circumstances’ to justify a stay of a criminal trial pending
resolution of an appeal; and (viii) the courts should exercise great
caution in allowing other forms of collateral challenge, in parallel
proceedings such as an application for a declaration or other forms of
judicial review with similar relief in the nature of certiorari, be it

commenced in the same court or another civil or criminal court, which
have the net effect of staying the criminal proceedings or would interfere
with or impinge directly upon the normal course of proceedings in a
criminal trial. (para 32)
(5) The respondent was a public figure who stood charged with offences,
which could not be described as trivial, allegedly committed while he
was holding office as the Prime Minister. Public interest, and indeed his
personal interest, dictated that the trials against him should be
commenced expeditiously without any unreasonable delay as it is at the
denouncement of the trial that the court is best-equipped to determine
his guilt or otherwise based on factual evidence instead of speculative
arguments. Furthermore, the respondent had not satisfactorily
established that his application was so unusual or exceptional that it fell
within that class of cases which would justify the grant of a stay. A stay
of criminal proceedings would only be granted in the rarest of cases and,
the fact that the proceedings may be rendered a nullity, is not a special
circumstance. In the context of an application for a stay of proceedings,
it is also immaterial that the respondent is put to the expense of a trial
even if he is subsequently vindicated on appeal. (para 33)
(6) The respondent’s assertion that the appeal by the appellant was
incompetent, since there was no appeal record and no petition filed, as
required by the CJA, was a non-issue because, for criminal proceedings,
the record of appeal, including the grounds of judgment of the lower
court is prepared by the court below, as provided under r. 91 of the
Rules of the Federal Court 1995 (‘ROFC’). Without the grounds of
judgment, the appellant could not proceed to file the petition of appeal,
by virtue of r. 95 of the ROFC. The appellant was not at fault and, in
any case, the incomplete appeal papers were no impediment to this court
hearing the appeal proper as this court was exercising its revisionary
powers. (para 34)

Responden, bekas Perdana Menteri Malaysia, dituduh dengan tujuh
pertuduhan berkaitan pelakuan kesalahan-kesalahan bawah Kanun
Keseksaan, Akta Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia 2009 dan Akta
Pengubahan Wang Haram, Pencegahan Pembiayaan Keganasan dan Hasil
Daripada Aktiviti Haram 2001. Rayuan-rayuan ini timbul susulan keputusan
Mahkamah Rayuan membenarkan perintah penggantungan prosiding, bawah
ss. 44, 79 dan 80 Akta Mahkamah Kehakiman 1964 (‘AMK’) dan
bersangkutan itu, menghentikan pemulaan perbicaraan terhadap responden
di Mahkamah Tinggi sementara menanti pelupusan rayuan-rayuan beliau di
Mahkamah Persekutuan. Ketiga-tiga rayuan yang masih belum selesai di
Mahkamah Persekutuan, difailkan oleh responden, berkaitan kegagalan
beliau (i) memperoleh perintah larangan bersuara menghalang orang awam
menerbitkan hal-hal perkara berkaitan pendakwaan dan perbicaraan beliau;

(ii) memperoleh dokumen selain yang diperuntukkan bawah s. 51A Kanun
Tatacara Jenayah (‘KTJ’); dan (iii) mencabar penarikan balik akuan
pindahan oleh Pendakwa Raya (‘perayu’) untuk memindah kes terhadap
responden di Mahkamah Tinggi. Asasnya, perayu bergantung pada alasanalasan rayuan berikut: (i) penggantungan perbicaraan jenayah mesti
dikendalikan secara berbeza berbanding perbicaraan sivil; (ii) duluan-duluan
dalam kes-kes sivil yang menjadi sandaran responden di Mahkamah Rayuan,
khususnya Kosma Palm Oil Mill Sdn Bhd & Ors v. Koperasi Serbausaha Makmur
Bhd (‘kes Kosma’), mesti dikendalikan dengan berhati-hati dalam prosiding
jenayah; (iii) jika perbicaraan perlu, secara statutori, bermula dalam tiga
bulan, membenarkan penggantungan melumpuhkan objektif ini.
Penggantungan perbicaraan jenayah mesti diberi atas alasan-alasan luar biasa
sahaja; itu pun secara berkira-kira agar tidak melumpuhkan objektif
s. 172B(4) KTJ agar perbicaraan bermula dalam masa tiga bulan; dan (iv) jika
mahkamah ini berpendapat hal-hal keadaan istimewa adalah pertimbangan
utama dalam memutuskan permohonan penggantungan prosiding perbicaraan
jenayah, fakta kes ini menghalang kebenaran penggantungan kerana tiada halhal keadaan istimewa yang memihak pada responden. Sebaliknya faktorfaktor berikut menunjukkan penggantungan harus ditolak: (a) kesalahankesalahan yang didakwa terhadap responden bersifat serius; (b) kes ini
mempunyai kepentingan awam dan antarabangsa kerana menarik minat
awam dan antarabangsa; (c) tarikh perbicaraan ditetapkan lapan bulan lalu,
berbanding tiga bulan yang diperuntukkan bawah s. 172B(4) KTJ; dan
(iv) responden tidak akan terprejudis kerana beliau akan mempunyai peluang
awal menyangkal pertuduhan. Responden menghujahkan rayuan perayu tidak
kompeten kerana rekod rayuan dan petisyen tidak difailkan, seperti yang
dikehendaki bawah AMK. Isu utama yang berbangkit untuk diputuskan
adalah sama ada Mahkamah Rayuan bertindak betul dalam membenarkan
permohonan responden untuk penggantungan prosiding jenayah.
Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan; mengetepikan perintah
penggantungan oleh Mahkamah Rayuan; dan mengembalikan hal perkara
pada Mahkamah Tinggi untuk meneruskan dengan perbicaraan jenayah)
Oleh Richard Malanjum KHN menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah:
(1) Seksyen 44(1) dan 80(1) AMK menyebut tentang ‘prosiding yang belum
selesai’ sebagai pra-syarat sebelum perintah interim boleh dibuat oleh
mahkamah yang relevan. Semasa permohonan penggantungan dibuat
oleh responden, Mahkamah Rayuan telah menolak ketiga-tiga rayuan
oleh responden. Oleh itu, tiada lagi apa-apa ‘prosiding yang belum
selesai’ di Mahkamah Rayuan yang membolehkannya menjalankan budi
bicaranya membenarkan penggantungan prosiding bawah s. 44(1) AMK.
Begitu juga, agar responden boleh memanfaatkan s. 80(1) AMK, mesti
juga terdapat ‘prosiding yang belum selesai’ di Mahkamah Persekutuan.
Semasa rayuan-rayuan responden ditolak oleh Mahkamah Rayuan, tiada
prosiding yang belum selesai di Mahkamah Persekutuan pada peringkat
itu. Hanya terdapat janji oleh responden bahawa beliau akan memfailkan
rayuan. Oleh itu, s. 79 AMK tidak relevan.



566

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

(2) Seksyen 44(1) dan 80(1) AMK tidak memberi kuasa kepada Mahkamah
Rayuan untuk membenarkan penggantungan prosiding. Oleh kerana
sandaran responden pada ss. 44(1) dan 80(1) AMK gagal, diikuti bahawa
s. 79 AMK juga tidak membantu beliau. Mahkamah Rayuan tiada
bidang kuasa mendengar permohonan responden untuk penggantungan
prosiding selepas penolakan ketiga-tiga rayuan. Oleh itu, kebenaran
penggantungan dibuat tanpa bidang kuasa dan terbatal.
(3) Kes Kosma mewakili kedudukan undang-undang yang menyelia
penggantungan pelaksanaan rayuan-rayuan sivil. Dalam kes Kosma,
diputuskan bahawa ujian yang terpakai dalam kebenaran penggantungan
pelaksanaan ialah sama ada terdapat hal-hal keadaan istimewa dan yang
paling lazim ialah sama ada rayuan menjadi tidak berguna jika
penggantungan pelaksanaan tidak dibenarkan. Soalan yang relevan ialah
sama ada keterpakaian ini mempunyai kuasa yang sama dalam
penggantungan prosiding jenayah di mahkamah perbicaraan apabila
terdapat rayuan-rayuan yang belum selesai berkaitan permohonan
interlokutori di mahkamah.
(4) Dalam mempertimbangkan permohonan penggantungan prosiding
jenayah, apabila pemulaan perbicaraan belum selesai dan berterusan di
mahkamah pertama, prinsip-prinsip penentu adalah: (i) terdapat
kepentingan awam yang kuat dalam pendakwaan jenayah dan dalam
memastikan mereka yang didakwa dengan kesalahan-kesalahan jenayah
serius dibicarakan; (ii) proses jenayah yang diganggu atau diceraiceraikan oleh prosiding interlokutori tidak diingini. Pertimbangan
kepentingan awam berat memihak pada penyelesaian segera pertuduhanpertuduhan jenayah; (iii) ketidakinginan mencerai-ceraikan proses
jenayah tidak terbatas pada mana-mana bahagian proses jenayah tetapi
keseluruhan prosesnya; (iv) permohonan penggantungan prosiding
mengkehendaki, khususnya, alasan memaksa dalam kes yang
melayakkan keputusan segera kehakiman. Contohnya, penting agar
siapa-siapa yang dituduh dengan kesalahan jenayah serius dibicarakan
dengan segera. Kepentingan awam tidak tercapai dengan membenarkan
pihak pembelaan memohon penangguhan. Seorang tertuduh yang
melakukan kesalahan jenayah serius, yang tidak bersalah, mesti
berpeluang membersihkan namanya tanpa apa-apa penangguhan
terlampau; (v) lazimnya, penggantungan prosiding tidak akan
dibenarkan sementara menanti rayuan interlokutori dalam perbicaraan
jenayah. Hanya dalam hal-hal keadaan luar biasa atau berkelainan
barulah perintah penggantungan dibenarkan. Ini keadaannya jika pun
kebenaran rayuan interlokutori tidak dibantah oleh pihak pendakwaan
atau disokong oleh kedua-dua pihak pendakwaan dan pembelaan;
(vi) hak-hak tertuduh atas keputusan awalan atau interlokutori yang
dibuat oleh hakim bicara sebaiknya diselesaikan melalui rayuan

selepas sabitan, jika ada. Amnya, adalah lebih diingini untuk
mempertimbangkan keputusan awalan atau interlokutori yang
dibuat oleh hakim bicara dalam rayuan selepas sabitan selepas
perbicaraan penuh dengan manfaat ketetapan fakta berbanding
mempertimbangkannya secara abstrak dalam rayuan interlokutori;
(vii) fakta bahawa perbicaraan tertuduh memakan kos tinggi tidak
relevan dan tidak akan melayakkan ‘hal-hal keadaan luar biasa’ untuk
mewajarkan penggantungan perbicaraan jenayah sementara menanti
penyelesaian rayuan; dan (viii) mahkamah harus amat berhati-hati dalam
membenarkan lain-lain bentuk cabaran kolateral, dalam prosiding selari
seperti permohonan pengisytiharan atau lain-lain bentuk semakan
kehakiman dengan relief serupa bersifat certiorari, sama ada dimulakan
di mahkamah sama atau mahkamah sivil atau jenayah lain, yang
mempunyai kesan menggantung prosiding jenayah atau mengganggu atau
memberi kesan langsung dalam perjalanan biasa prosiding dalam
perbicaraan jenayah.
(5) Responden adalah tokoh terkenal yang dituduh dengan kesalahankesalahan yang tidak boleh dianggap kecil, yang didakwa dilakukan
semasa beliau menyandang jawatan Perdana Menteri. Kepentingan
awam, malah kepentingan peribadi beliau sendiri, menetapkan bahawa
perbicaraan-perbicaraan terhadap beliau harus bermula segera tanpa
apa-apa kelengahan tidak munasabah kerana semasa perbicaraan
pertuduhan mahkamah mempunyai material yang cukup untuk
menentukan kebersalahan beliau, atau sebaliknya, berdasarkan
keterangan fakta berbanding hujahan-hujahan secara spekulasi.
Tambahan lagi, responden tidak membuktikan, dengan memuaskan,
permohonan beliau begitu luar biasa atau lain daripada yang lain
hinggakan permohonan tersebut terangkum dalam kelas kes-kes yang
mewajarkan kebenaran penggantungan. Penggantungan prosiding
jenayah hanya akan diberi dalam kes-kes yang sangat luar biasa dan,
fakta prosiding boleh menjadi terbatal, bukan hal keadaan istimewa.
Dalam konteks permohonan penggantungan prosiding, tidak material
bahawa responden terpaksa menanggung kos tinggi jika pun dia
seterusnya bebas selepas rayuan.
(6) Hujahan responden bahawa rayuan perayu tidak kompeten, kerana
rekod rayuan dan petisyen tidak difailkan, seperti yang dikehendaki
bawah AMK, bukan satu isu kerana, dalam prosiding jenayah, rekod
rayuan, termasuk alasan penghakiman mahkamah bawahan disediakan
oleh mahkamah bawahan, seperti yang diperuntukkan oleh k. 91
Kaedah-kaedah Mahkamah Persekutuan (‘KKMP’). Tanpa alasan
penghakiman, perayu tidak boleh meneruskan untuk memfailkan
petisyen rayuan, seperti yang diperuntukkan oleh k. 95 KKMP. Perayu
tidak boleh disalahkan dan, dalam apa-apa jua keadaan, kertas rayuan
yang tidak lengkap bukan halangan buat mahkamah ini mendengar
rayuan kerana mahkamah ini menjalankan kuasa semakannya.

Richard Malanjum CJ:
Introduction
H

I

[1]
The respondent is the immediate former Prime Minister of Malaysia
who is currently facing seven charges before the High Court, ie, (i) one
charge under s. 23 of the MACC Act; (ii) three charges under s. 409 of the
Penal Code and (iii) three charges for offences under s. 4 of the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities
Act 2001 (“the AMLATFA proceedings”).

[2]
The present appeals emanate from the decision of the Court of Appeal
granting an order of stay of proceedings and consequently stopping the
commencement of a trial against the respondent at the High Court pending
the disposal of his appeals to this court. Dissatisfied with the decision of the
Court of Appeal granting stay, the appellant filed the present appeals.

A

[3]
The three appeals pending before this court filed by the respondent
relate to:

B

(i) his failure to secure a “gag order” restraining publication by members
of the public on matters pertaining to his prosecution and trial;
(ii) his failure to secure documents other than those provided under s. 51A
of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) prior to the commencement
of trial although 32 bundles (7,000 pages) of documents had already
been served to him by the prosecution in compliance with its statutory
duty under s. 51A of the CPC; and

C

(iii) his failure to challenge the withdrawal by the Public Prosecutor of a
transfer certificate to transfer the case against the respondent to the High
Court, which is the agreed forum of both parties for this trial.

D

[4]

In essence, the appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal:

(i) the test for granting a stay should be different for civil and criminal
trials. Staying a criminal trial should in law be differently treated from
staying a civil trial. The omission of power of the appellate courts in
their criminal jurisdiction to grant stay of proceedings was deliberate
and the parliamentary draftsperson had good reason to treat the power
in civil and criminal stays separately and distinctly.
(ii) precedents in civil cases relied by the respondent before the Court of
Appeal like Kosma Palm Oil Mill Sdn Bhd & Ors v. Koperasi Serbausaha
Makmur Bhd [2003] 4 CLJ 1; [2004] 1 MLJ 257 and Rowstead Systems
Sdn Bhd v. Bumicrystal Technology (M) Sdn Bhd [2005] 2 CLJ 465; [2005]
3 MLJ 132 must be treated with caution in criminal proceedings.
(iii) with the coming into force of s. 172B(4) to the CPC in 2012, the
previous practice of delaying criminal trials for many years is a thing of
the past. If trials are statutorily required to commence within three
months, granting a stay will defeat this objective. Stay of a criminal trial
should only be granted on exceptional grounds: that is sparingly so as
not to defeat the purposive object of s. 172B(4) of the CPC for trials to
start in three months.
(iv) if this court is of the view that special circumstances are the principal
consideration in determining an application for stay of proceedings for
criminal trials, the facts in this case militate against the granting of a stay
because no special circumstances favoring the respondent exist. On the
contrary, these factors indicate that a stay should be refused:

(a) the offences for which the respondent have been charged are serious
in nature;
(b) this case is one of public and national importance; it has generated
much public interest locally as well as internationally;
(c) trial dates were fixed eight months ago as opposed to the three
months specified under s. 172B(4);

B

(d) that no prejudice would be caused to the respondent because he will
have an early opportunity to vindicate himself.

Before The High Court
[5]

Three matters were brought before the High Court for determination:

(Case No: WA-44-115-07-2018)

D

E

F

G

H

I

(i) The respondent had filed a notice of motion to prevent the media and
the public from discussing the merits of the criminal charges against
the respondent until the conclusion of proceedings.
(ii) An interim gag order had been put into effect at the conclusion of an
oral application after the initial four charges were read on 4 July 2018.
A subsequent formal application was filed and fixed for hearing on
19 April 2018.
(iii) While the respondent had no issue with accurate reporting and articles
that were fair, factually accurate, and published contemporaneously in
good faith, the motion is for an order to prevent the publication of
opinions on guilt or innocence and character of the respondent, as well
as those of the witnesses, and to prevent discussion of the merits
predicting or even influencing the outcome of the trial.
(iv) The respondent sought the order to ensure that he would receive a fair
trial, and the order would be proportionate and would not unfairly
impinge upon the interest of free speech.
(v) The appellant took the position that the court did not have jurisdiction
to grant such an order and that this was not a proper case for the court
to invoke its inherent powers. There was no substantial risk of
prejudice to the administration of justice, and that there were many
remedies available to the respondent to protect his interests.
(vi) The appellant contended that a gag order would infringe art. 10 of the
Federal Constitution, and that the order would be in vain as it would
potentially not bind the international media. The appellant argued that
sub judice would be inapplicable due to the absence of jury trials in this
country.

(vii) The learned trial judge found that the scope of the application was
plainly wide, and the respondent’s intention was to stop future
discussion or publication that would prejudice his right to a fair trial,
the ramifications of which would result in a contempt of court. The
learned trial judge found that according to art. 126 of the Federal
Constitution the courts did have the power to make orders in the
nature of prior restraint against prejudicial discussions or publications
affecting a fair trial. But the test to be applied before such orders are
made is to consider whether the risk of prejudice to a fair trial is
serious or real or substantial. The learned trial judge referred to
Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd v. Fadha Nur Ahmad Kamar &
Anor [2012] 6 CLJ 93; [2012] 7 MLJ 657.
(viii) The learned trial judge found that the immediacy of the risk or threat
of the prejudice is especially pertinent when one seeks a prohibition
which involves a pre-emptive and prior restraint order, as those who
are in breach would immediately be in contempt as opposed to
situations where in the absence of a gag order an action for contempt
is only taken after the actual commissions of the contemptuous act.
There is a heavier burden of showing the immediacy of the threat. The
gag order must be shown to be necessary to prevent an immediate
threat of a real and substantial risk of serious prejudice to the
administration of justice in the relevant proceedings, in the absence of
alternative measures, and is proportionate in reference to the
competing interests of free speech and risk of prejudice to a fair trial.
(ix) The learned trial judge found that since there are no jury trials in
Malaysia and that cases are tried before a single judge who is
constitutionally duty-bound to consider only the evidence in court and
disregard all extraneous matters, the possibility of prejudice from
unwarranted publications is unmistakably remote. This is not to say
judges are infallible, but it bears emphasis that judges in discharging
their judicial responsibilities must only consider the facts and the law
applicable to the particular case and cannot succumb to public
opinion.
(x) The learned trial judge found that the absence of jury trials meant that
the scope for the application of the sub judice rule is decidedly more
circumscribed in the Malaysian justice system. As for the unwarranted
publicity influencing witnesses, they would be subject to examination
in chief, cross-examination, and re-examination to determine their
reliability, credibility or lack thereof. The decisions of the judges
would also be subject to appeals.
(xi) Some accusatory articles cited by the respondent had been in the
public sphere since 2014, negating the element of immediacy. The
respondent had also given interviews attempting to answer the

allegations, and probably attracted far greater public and media
interest than the less-than-current allegations that have surfaced for a
number of years. This also suggests a balanced reporting of the rival
views.
(xii) Legal remedies are available to the respondent, making the gag order
unnecessary as contempt laws and defamation laws can be resorted to.
The gag order is also difficult to sustain as it is targeted to the world
at large, and the application proposes a scope significantly wider than
what has been affirmed in the accompanying affidavit in support.
Thus, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the application.

(i) The appellant filed a notice of motion for pre-trial production of
statements and documents given by potential witnesses to the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in the course of
investigations.
(ii) The appellant had delivered all documents under s. 51A of the CPC,
mostly covering the documents sought by the respondent in this notice
of motion, save for paras. 1(g), (h), (i), (j), and 2(b)(i). These mainly
pertain to names, statements, information and documents obtained
under s. 30(1)(a), (b), (c) and 30(8) of the MACC Act and s. 32(2)(a),
(b) and (c) of AMLATFA. The respondent also sought for a list of
witnesses the appellant intends to call and their proposed order.
(iii) The thrust of the application is on the non-obstante clauses (Latin:
notwithstanding) whereby, these statements, documents etc, such as
those obtained under s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and s. 40 of
AMLATFA, are automatically admissible at the behest of either
party. It is the respondent’s contention that due to this very nature,
they ought to be supplied to the respondent before commencement of
trial, and that this is also supported by s. 62 of the MACC Act, as well
as the role of the court.
(iv) The appellant’s position is that the application ought to be dismissed
as the respondent has misconstrued s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and
s. 40 of AMLATFA to exclude all other legislation/provisions,
particularly the Evidence Act 1950. The non-obstante clauses must be
read subject to the rules of privilege and prohibition on the grounds
of public policy.
(v) The learned trial judge made reference to Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk
Ishak Ismail [2016] 3 CLJ 19; [2016] 1 MLJ 733 that held that where
statements taken in the course of investigations are to be automatically
admissible, they must be subject to provisions of the Evidence Act,
which were made to codify rules pertaining to law of privilege and



574

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

public policy against disclosure of investigation statements. While the
respondent argued that the provisions of Datuk Ishak’s case did not
involve a non-obstante clause, the learned trial judge further referred
to Ho Tack Sien & Ors v. Rotta Research Laboratorium S.p.A & Anor;
Registrar Of Trade Marks (Intervener) & Another Appeal [2015] 4 CLJ 20;
[2015] 4 MLJ 166 and held that the respondent had not clearly made
out a case as to the extent to which the Legislature had intended to give
the relevant non-obstante clauses overriding effect over all other rules
and legal provisions.
(vi) The learned trial judge held that the admissibility of these documents
did not equate to the right to inspect. The respondent cited various
authorities from Commonwealth jurisdictions, and even beyond, and
propagated the equality of arms principle by claiming the respondent
was being put at a disadvantage if not afforded the opportunity to view
the documents etc. However, the learned trial judge was of the view
that the respondent did not demonstrate how he was being
discriminated against, as compared to the other persons who are
similarly under investigation by the MACC. While other countries
have had advancements in adhering to the equal arms principle,
Malaysia too has seen fundamental progress with the introduction of
s. 51A of the CPC. Any further development must await legislative
intervention, and cannot be achieved by mere and purported prismatic
construction of constitutional prescriptions.
(vii) The learned trial judge found that other than s. 51A of CPC and s. 62
of the MACC Act, no other law or clear legislative prescriptions exist
demanding disclosure, and no automatic disclosure can be founded on
non-obstante clauses. There has been no compelling legal analysis that
could support the quantum leap from automatic admissibility to right
to inspection. The learned trial judge made reference to PP v. Dato’ Seri
Anwar Ibrahim & Another Appeal [2010] 4 CLJ 331.
Hence the respondent’s application was dismissed as he had failed to
establish a case for delivery of the information and documents applied for.

(i) The High Court had fixed the trial of the seven charges on 12 February
2019 and to continue on 29 March 2019.

H

(ii) On both dates of 4 July 2018 and 8 August 2018, the charges were
initially filed at the Sessions Court but they were immediately
transferred on the same dates to High Court pursuant to the certificate
issued by Public Prosecutor under s. 418A of CPC and s. 60 of the
MACC Act.

(iii) On 28 January 2019, another three additional charges under
AMLATFA were read out to the accused. The prosecution asked for
these three new charges to be jointly tried with existing seven charges.
Counsel for the respondent asked the High Court to allow the defence
a few days to consider. The court allowed the request and fixed
hearing for submission of the parties on the proposed joint trial on
7 February 2019.

C

(iv) On 7 February 2019, the appellant informed the court that a ruling on
the issue of joinder would not be necessary as he was proposing not
to proceed on the three new charges and asked for the respondent be
granted a DNAA (discharge not amounting to acquittal), since the
prosecution would file these charges before the Sessions Court instead.
The High Court then ordered the DNAA of the respondent on the
three new charges.

D

(v) The appellant also wished to withdraw the transfer certificates that had
been previously issued under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the
MACC Act to transfer the seven charges to the High Court.

E

(vi) The withdrawal was stated by the appellant to be done out of
abundance of caution in order to avoid any possible constitutional
argument that the transfer effected by the appellant under s. 418A of
the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC was a nullity in view of the decisions
of this court in Semenyih Jaya Sdn Bhd v. Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Hulu
Langat & Another Case [2017] 5 CLJ 526; [2017] 3 MLJ 561 and Indira
Gandhi Mutho v. Pengarah Jabatan Agama Islam Perak & Ors And Other
Appeals [2018] 3 CLJ 145; [2018] 1 MLJ 545.

F

(vii) The appellant informed the High Court that upon withdrawal, the
cases on the seven charges would be reverted to the Sessions Court
where they originated. The prosecution then immediately applied
under s. 417 to have the cases transferred back to the High Court.
G

(viii) Alternatively, the appellant suggested the High Court to act suo moto
(on its own motion) under s. 417(2) of the CPC to order the transfer
of the cases from the Sessions Court back to High Court. The appellant
highlighted that these procedural steps would be necessary to prevent
any unwarranted postponement of the trial.

H

(ix) The learned trial judge then ordered the transfer of the seven charges
from the Sessions Court back to the High Court in accordance with
s. 417(1)(cc) of the CPC.

I

[6]
It is to be noted that following the dismissal of these three criminal
applications, the respondent made an oral application for a stay of
proceedings that were to commence on 12 February 2019 to 29 March 2019,
pending the appeals against the dismissal of the same. The learned High



576

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

Court Judge dismissed the application for a stay of proceedings on the ground
that the mere prospect of the trial being a nullity could not be construed as
special circumstances to warrant a stay of proceedings.

A

Before The Court Of Appeal
[7]
Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the respondent appealed
to the Court of Appeal where all the appeals were heard together. Prior to
the hearing to the appeals, the respondent applied for a stay of proceedings
under s. 44 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (“CJA”). A stay of
proceedings was duly allowed by the Court of Appeal pending the disposal
of the appeals proper. On 21 March 2019, the Court of Appeal dismissed the
respondent’s appeals and on oral application by the respondent granted an
order to stay the proceedings pending the disposal of the respondent’s appeals
to this court.
[8]
The Court of Appeal opined that there is no distinction between civil
and criminal proceedings and that what is relevant is whether there are
special circumstances. From the facts, the Court of Appeal held that the
prospect of the charges being declared a nullity was there. Moreover the
present appeals involved novel issues namely the withdrawal of the s. 418A
certificate, the pre-emptive gag order and discovery of documents based on
non-obstante clauses. The Court of Appeal also found that there were no
delaying tactics by the respondent.

Issues Before This Court
[9]
The question before us is whether the Court of Appeal was correct in
allowing the respondent’s application for a stay of the criminal proceedings.
The Appellant’s Submission

F

[10] It is the appellant’s position that in respect of the present appeals,
which are all of an interlocutory nature:
(i) concurrent findings by both the courts below have been made against the
accused and that the appeals are frivolous and doomed to fail;
(ii) a distinction should be made between a stay of execution that is
governed by s. 311 of the CPC and a stay of proceedings, on which the
CPC is silent. This difference must be taken to have been a deliberate
act by the parliamentary draftsperson to highlight the distinction
between the both particularly when read together with s. 172B(4) of the
CPC which provides that criminal trials should start no later than three
months after an accused has been charged. If trials are statutorily
required to commence within three months after an accused has been
charged, then granting a stay would defeat this objective.

A

B

PP v. Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abd Razak

577

(iii) Furthermore, under the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (Act 91), both
appellate courts have jurisdiction to grant stay of proceedings and stay
of execution in civil matters but in criminal matters the appellate courts
only have power to grant a stay post-conviction, that is, at the
conclusion of trial. Again this omission by the parliamentary
draftsperson must be taken to have been intentional.
(iv) Notwithstanding an absence of statutory power to order the stay of a
criminal trial, the court may still exercise power to order a stay of
criminal proceedings by way of its inherent jurisdiction. However, this
absence of statutory power to stay criminal trials must mean that:

C

(a) the test for granting a stay should be different for civil and criminal
trials;
(b) precedents laid down in civil cases must be treated with caution in
criminal matters; and

D

E

F

(c) a stay of a criminal trial should only be granted in exceptional
circumstances (as per the Court of Appeal decision in Dato’ Seri
Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2011] 7 CLJ 253; [2011] 5 MLJ 535).
(v) If the civil law test of “special circumstances” is applicable in a criminal
law context, it is the possibility of the appeal being rendered nugatory
that needs protection, and not the proceedings in the court below. On
the facts, the appeals would not be rendered nugatory if a stay of the trial
is refused because the accused would still be able to proceed with the
hearing of the appeals currently pending before this court.
(vi) In Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim (supra) a stay was refused for a charge of
sodomy. For the present appeals, no “special circumstances” favouring
the accused exist as:
(a) the offences are serious in nature;
(b) the case is one of public and national importance;

G

(c) it has generated much public interest locally as well as
internationally;
(d) trial dates were fixed eight months ago (as opposed to the three
months specified under s. 172B(4); and
H

(e) no prejudice will be caused to the accused because he will have an
early opportunity to vindicate himself.
The Respondent’s Submissions
[11]

The respondent on the other hand contends that:

I

(i) The Court of Appeal in issuing the “interim order” was fully
empowered under ss. 44, 79 and 80 of the CJA to stay of proceedings;



578

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

(ii) Sections 44 and 80 of the CJA fall within the “general” provisions
applicable to both the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeal and Federal Court;
(iii) Cases such as Silver Concept Sdn Bhd v. Brisdale Rasa Development Sdn Bhd
[2002] 4 CLJ 27; [2002] 4 MLJ 113, Choong Wooi Leong & Ors v. Lebbey
Sdn Bhd (No 2) [1998] 2 CLJ 509; [1998] 2 MLJ 661, Takako Sakao v.
Ng Pek Yuen & Anor (No. 3) [2010] 1 CLJ 429; [2010] 2 MLJ 141, and
Rowstead Systems Sdn Bhd v. Bumicrystal Technology (M) Sdn Bhd [2005]
2 CLJ 465; [2005] 3 MLJ 132 affirm the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeal to make interim orders under ss. 44 or 80 of the CJA in the
nature of stay of proceedings in order to “prevent prejudice to the claims
of parties” pending the hearing of an appeal and to “preserve the
integrity of pending appeals”;
(iv) The court retains inherent jurisdiction to make any orders to prevent
prejudice to an accused person. The CPC is limited to the procedure to
try offences and is not an exhaustive directory of the court’s powers. As
part of the inherent powers of the court it may do all things reasonably
necessary to ensure fair administration of justice and to safeguard an
accused person from oppression or prejudice;
(v) The case of Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim (supra) adopted the special
circumstances approach and the nugatory approach;

A

B

C

D

E

(vi) The court should not consider the merits of the case in an application
for stay;
(vii) The prospect that the trial is rendered a nullity amounts to special
circumstances. For the present appeals, the potential nullity of
proceedings arises from the following:
(a) If the Federal Court agrees with the respondent on the issue
of natural justice, the entire proceedings would be nullified (see:
PP v. Ishak Hj Shaari & Other Appeals [2003] 3 CLJ 843). If the
proceedings are subsequently nullified, it would waste the time and
effort of all persons involved. Besides, a retrial in the event of
nullity would be prejudicial to the respondent as the witnesses who
are re-examined may change their evidence and the prosecution may
get a second bite of the cherry in the conduct of the trial;
(b) If the Public Prosecutor has no power to withdraw the s. 418A
certificate and had acted unconstitutionally when he did so, the
proceedings would be vitiated;
(c) If the matter was never “pending” before the Sessions Court as no
plea was taken therein, the High Court could not have exercised the
powers under s. 417(2) of the CPC (see: PP v. Dato’ Yap Peng [1987]
1 LNS 28; [1987] 2 MLJ 311 SC and s. 417(2) CPC);

(d) The High Court Judge had allegedly exercised his powers suo moto
to transfer the matter back to himself, thereby bypassing the registry
and the powers of the Chief Judge of Malaya under s. 20 of the CJA
to distribute business;
(e) The appellant’s reliance on R v. Christian [2007] 2 AC 400 PC is
distinguishable in fact and law because in that case, the application
for a stay was a final remedy sought by the accused in the substantive
appeal on the grounds of an alleged abuse of process while the
present appeals are in respect of an interlocutory application for a
stay of proceedings pending appeal;

B

C

(f) The Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim case (supra) which held that “delaying
tactics engineered by the appellant should be a factor in refusing to
grant the stay” is distinguishable in fact as the Court of Appeal had
on two occasions held that there was no evidence of any delay tactics
by the respondent; and

D

(g) The Court of Appeal’s ruling in granting stay of proceedings is
consistent with the decision of this court in Subashini Rajasingam
v. Saravanan Thangathotray [2008] 2 CLJ 1; [2008] 2 MLJ 147 as its
purpose is to maintain the status quo of an earlier interim order
pending an appeal on a matter that has been dismissed.

E

Decision Of This Court

F

[12] As alluded to above, the only issue in the present appeals is confined
to the decision of the Court of Appeal granting an order to stay the
commencement of a criminal trial pending disposal of three appeals brought
by the defence to this court.
[13] During the course of oral submissions before us, the respondent
confirmed that the Court of Appeal had allowed a stay of proceedings based
on ss. 44, 79 and 80 of the CJA alone.

G

H

Section 44(1) of the CJA reads:
In any proceeding pending before the Court of Appeal any direction

While s. 80(1) of the CJA provides that:

In any proceeding pending before the Federal Court any direction
incidental thereto not involving the decision of the proceeding, any
interim order to prevent prejudice to the claims of parties pending the
hearing of the proceeding, any order for security for costs, and for the
dismissal of a proceeding for default in furnishing security so ordered may
at any time be made by a Judge of the Federal Court.

[16] We have scrutinised ss. 44(1) and 80(1) of the CJA. It is noteworthy
that both speak of “pending proceedings” as a pre-requisite before an interim
order can be made by the relevant court. It is to be noted that when the stay
application was made by the respondent, the Court of Appeal had already
dismissed the three appeals filed by the respondent. In the circumstances,
there was no longer any “pending” proceeding before the Court of Appeal
enabling it to exercise its jurisdiction to grant a stay of proceedings under
s. 44(1) of the CJA.
[17] Similarly, for the respondent to avail himself of s. 80(1) of the CJA,
there must also be a “proceeding pending” before the Federal Court. When
the respondent’s appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal, there was
no pending proceeding before the Federal Court at that stage. There was only
an undertaking by the respondent that they would be filing an appeal. As such
s. 79 was not relevant. For those reasons ss. 44(1) and 80(1) of the CJA do
not empower the Court of Appeal to grant a stay of proceedings in light of
the factual matrix of the present appeals. Since the respondent’s reliance on
ss. 44(1) and 80(1) fails as alluded to above, it follows that s. 79 of the CJA
is similarly of no assistance to him. Going from the above, the Court of
Appeal had no jurisdiction to entertain the respondent’s application for a stay
of proceedings upon the dismissal of the three appeals. The grant of the stay
was therefore made without jurisdiction and thus a nullity. It is therefore
incumbent on this court to revise such order for being a nullity. The enabling
provisions are s. 86 of the CJA read together with s. 87 of the same which
confer upon this court a general supervisory and revisionary power identical
to the High Court’s to correct mistakes committed by courts subordinate to
it in respect of any criminal matter (see: PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim [2014]
5 CLJ 805 FC (at para. [17]). On this ground alone, this court is seised with
the necessary jurisdiction to exercise its revisionary power to rectify the
grave error committed by the Court of Appeal.
[18] More crucially and independently of the above, we shall now address
the applicable test in the grant of stay in criminal proceedings. In his
application before the Court of Appeal, the respondent relied on the decision
of this court in Kosma Palm Oil Mill Sdn Bhd & Ors v. Koperasi Serbaguna
Makmur Bhd [2003] 4 CLJ 1; [2004] 1 MLJ 257. In Kosma Palm Oil, this
court held that the test applicable to the grant of a “stay of execution” is

whether there are special circumstances, the most common of which is
whether the appeal would be rendered nugatory if a stay of execution is not
granted (see paras. [7] - [10]).
[19] Kosma Palm Oil represents the legal position governing stays of
execution for civil appeals (see: Tan, Kee Heng, Civil and Criminal Appeals in
Malaysia, 3rd edn, (Sweet & Maxwell, 2016) at Chapter 7.3). The relevant
question before us now is whether it applies with equal force to a stay of
criminal proceedings at the trial court when there are pending appeals in
respect of interlocutory applications before this court.
[20] On this point, we note that there is only one reported decision from
the Court of Appeal affirming the proposition that Kosma is applicable. In
Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2011] 7 CLJ 253; [2011] 5 MLJ 535, Abdul
Malik Ishak JCA expressly endorsed the dual tests of “special
circumstances” and “nugatoriness” propounded in Kosma (at para. [81]) as
being equally relevant in an application to stay a criminal proceeding. His
Lordship further held that the background scenario, seriousness of the
offence which the accused is currently facing, and the conduct of the defence
in the trial (ie, the delaying tactics employed by the defence) are all relevant
factors to be considered by the court in deciding whether a stay of
proceedings in a criminal trial should be granted (at paras. [88] - [90]).
[21] The position in Australia is that generally jurisdiction of the courts to
stay civil or criminal proceedings pending appeal is an exercise of the
inherent jurisdiction of the courts (Jennings Constructions Ltd v. Burgundy
Royale Investments Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 681 at 684; Fuller & Cummings
v. Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (1994) 68 ALJR 611). Being an
extraordinary jurisdiction, exceptional circumstances must be shown before
its exercise is warranted. Keeping matters in status quo until the litigation is
finally resolved is not the purpose for which the inherent jurisdiction is
invoked. Something quite exceptional must be shown before that jurisdiction
is exercised (Edelsten v. Ward (No. 2) (1988) 63 ALJR 346).
[22] The courts apply a more stringent test in considering stay of criminal
proceedings. It will not normally be granted pending an interlocutory appeal
in any criminal trial. It is only in very exceptional or unusual circumstances
that a stay order is granted (McNamara v. R (1978) 20 ALR 98; R v. Iorlano
(1983) 151 CLR 678 at 680; De Simone v. The Queen [2012] HCATrans 86).
In Beljajev v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) 65 ALJR 400, the accused
was committed to prison to await his trial on various counts involving
narcotic drugs. He applied for a stay of that order pending appeal. Brennan J held
at para. [10] that preservation of a status quo alone does not warrant the
exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction to grant a stay. The jurisdiction can
be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances, particularly in the case of
interlocutory applications in a criminal trial.

[23] The reluctance of the court granting a stay of criminal proceeding is
primarily based on policy consideration. It is undesirable that the criminal
process be interrupted or fragmented by interlocutory proceedings (Sankey
v. Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 25-26, 82-83; The Queen v. Iorlano (1993)
151 CLR 678 at 680; Clyne v. The Director of Public Prosecutions for the
Commonwealth of Australia (1984) 154 CLR 640 at 643; Re Rozenes; Ex parte
Burd (1994) 120 ALR 193 at 194; Joosse v. Australian Securities and Investment
Commission (1999) 73 ALJR 232 at 234; Gedeon v. Commissioner of New South
Wales Crime Commission (2008) 236 CLR 120 at [23]; R v. WR [2009] ACTSC
93 at [21]; The Queen v. AI, AD and JR [2013] ACTCA 16 at [19]).

A

[24] In Seymour v. AG (Cth) (1984) 4 FCR 498, Jenkinson J explained the
underlying policy consideration having regard to the prominence of public
interest in the expeditious resolution of accusations of crime. He said this:
‘the longer such an accusation remains unresolved the greater the risk of
serious harm to the community. Those risks are multifarious: the fading of
witness’s recollections, the diminution of public confidence in the
administration of the criminal law, the prolonging of fears and hatred which
the resolution of criminal charges tends to allay, and uncertainty as to the
course which the life of the accused is to take, and not infrequently
uncertainty as to the courses of other lives, are perhaps the more obvious and
the most common. Those considerations of public interest are of great weight
...’ ((1984) 4 FCR 498 at 501).

C

[25] It has also been reasoned that “Crown appeals could easily lead to
oppression and the defendant’s rights are best vindicated by appeal after
conviction”. (See: R v. Garrett (1988) 49 SASR 435 at 451; see further
Brennan J in Beljajev v. DPP (1991) 173 CLR 28 at 32). The caution about
the undesirability of fragmentation of criminal process would be more
pronounced where a hearing of proceedings has actually commenced
(Khalil v. His Honour, Magistrate Johnson and Anor [2008] NSWSC 1092 at
[117]). Nevertheless, the general position remains that the undesirability of
fragmenting the criminal process is not confined to any particular part of the
criminal process, but rather to the process as a whole: “it is not the point that
in this case the trial had not commenced or had only just commenced at the
time the application for an adjournment to pursue a remedy in this court was
made. The principle would make little sense if it applied only to the
particular phase of the criminal process which was immediately threatened
by being interrupted. Any interference with any part of the process for other
than reasons as grave as those acknowledged in the cases referred
to is antithetical to the proper and just disposition of criminal cases.”
(Atlas v. D.P.P. [2001] VSC 209 at para. [26]).
[26] Besides, the Australian courts have taken the view that even if the
matters being complained of in the interlocutory appeal do take place and the
accused is convicted, “should the accused reach the stage (after conviction
upon full trial) where he wishes to contest on appeal the matters which

he now raises, it would then be possible to consider them in a factual
setting - a more desirable course than considering them in the abstract”
(see: Re Rozenes; Ex parte Burd (1994) 120 ALR 193 at 195). This is so even
if the issuing of the interlocutory appeal is not opposed by the prosecution
or in fact supported by both the prosecution and the defence, for instance to
seek a definitive ruling of the appellate or superior court on certain novel
issues: “many questions arise before and in the course of a trial in respect
of which a trial judge would be much assisted by a definitive ruling of this
court or the Court of Appeal. However, the proper application of the
principles of criminal procedure means that trial judges are required to make
rulings on evidence or determine points of procedure as and when they arise
either prior to or in the course of criminal trials no matter how novel or
difficult the points raised might be. The appeal system exists to ensure that
an error made by a trial judge which leads to the possibility of a miscarriage
of justice in the result can be corrected in the Court of Appeal.” (Atlas v.
D.P.P. [2001] VSC 209 at [23]).
[27] Perhaps most importantly, the Australian courts have taken the stance
that the fact that an accused will be put to the expense of a trial is irrelevant
in considering whether proceedings should be stayed (Re Rozenes; Ex parte
Burd (1994) 120 ALR 193 at 195): “it is undeniable that, if the applicants
were ultimately to succeed upon appeal on the grounds which they now raise,
they would nevertheless have suffered the expense and strain of a criminal
trial. That, however, is a circumstance which is always present when it is
sought to contest the ruling of a trial judge and is not of itself, in my view,
an exceptional circumstance” (followed in R v. Chardon [2016] QCA 50 at
paras. [27]-[28]).
[28] Likewise, the courts in Australia generally show disinclination to
allow other forms of collateral challenge in parallel proceedings such as an
application for a declaration or other form of judicial review with similar
relief in the nature of certiorari, be it commenced in the same court or another
civil or criminal court, which has the net effect of staying the criminal
proceedings or would interfere with or impinge directly upon the normal
course of proceedings in a criminal trial (Sankey v. Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR
1 at [14]; R v. Iorlano (1983) 151 CLR 678 at 680; Yates v. Wilson (1989) 18
CLR 338 at 339; Attorney-General v. Smith (1985) 39 SASR 311 at 313; Jarrett
v. Seymour (1993) 119 ALR 46). In those cases, an important consideration
is the need to observe and not fragment the ordinary, and orderly, process
of a trial. That consideration would apply with particular force “where
proceedings are in charge of a judge who at this very moment is beginning
the trial”: Anderson v. Attorney-General of New South Wales (1987) 10 NSWLR
198 at p. 200 (followed in Hinch v. County Court of Victoria [2009] VSC 548
at para. [46]).

[2019] 6 CLJ

[29] In the UK, the power of the court to stay a criminal proceeding is
inherent in nature. (See: Re Wickham [1887] 35 Ch D 272 at p. 280).
Historically, a stay of proceedings “had the draconian effect of bringing
proceedings to a conclusion, unless it was of the conditional variety. This
has, however, been superseded by contemporary practice”. (See: R (on the
application of AO & AM) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (stay of
Proceedings - principles) [2017] UKUT 168 (IAC) at para. [20]). A stay of
proceedings is different from a stay of execution (AB (Sudan) v. Secretary of
State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 921 at para. [25]). In the
case of a stay of proceeding, the governing principles formulated by the Court
of Appeal in AB (Sudan) (at para. [26]), albeit discussed in the immigration
and asylum context, are that:
A stay on proceedings may be associated with the grant of interim relief,
but it is essentially different. In determining whether proceedings should
be stayed, the concerns of the court itself have to be taken into the
balance. Decisions as to listing, and decisions as to which cases are to be
heard at any particular time are matters for the court itself and no party
to a claim can demand that it be heard before or after any other claim.
The court will want to deal with claims before it as expeditiously as is
consistent with justice. But, on the other hand, it is unlikely to want to
waste time and other valuable resources on an exercise that may well be
pointless if conducted too soon. If, therefore, the court is shown that
there will be, or there is likely to be, some event in the foreseeable future
that may have an impact on the way a claim is decided, it may decide to
stay proceedings in the claim until after that event. It may be more
inclined to grant a stay if there is agreement between the parties. It may
not need to grant a stay if the pattern of work shows that the matter will
not come on for trial before the event in question. The starting point
must, however, be that a claimant seeks expeditious determination of his
claim and that delay will be ordered only if good reason is shown.
In cases where a request for a stay on proceedings is coupled, expressly
or by necessary implication, with a request for interim relief, the court will
need to take into account the factors relevant to both types of decision,
and may need to take into account a third: that by securing interim relief
and a stay, the applicant may be asking the court to use its powers to give
him, for as long as he can secure it, a benefit that he may not obtain at
the trial.

[30] In short, the principles distilled from the English Court of Appeal
decision in AB (Sudan) are these:

A

(i) every claimant is entitled to expect expeditious judicial adjudication.
The strength of this expectation will be calibrated according to the
individual litigation equation;
(ii) the judicially imposed delay flowing from a stay order requires good
reason;

(iii) judicial choreography whereby one case is frozen awaiting the outcome
of another is justified for example where the assessment is that the latter
will have a critical impact upon the former;
(iv) great caution is to be exercised where a stay application is founded on
the contention that the outcome of another case will significantly
influence the outcome of the instant case. (See: R (on the application of
AO & AM) at para. [23]); and
(v) a stay application will require especially compelling justification in a
case qualifying for urgent judicial decision. (See: R (on the application of
AO & AM) at para. [24]).
[31] While it is true that the above criteria were discussed in the context
of immigration and asylum cases, we do not find any reason to decline
adopting and applying the same to criminal proceedings.
Determinative Principles

D

[32] In summary, in considering an application for stay of criminal
proceedings when commencement of the trial is imminent or continuing in
the court of first instance, the determinative principles to be derived from the
above cases are as follows:
E

(i) There is a strong public interest in the prosecution of crime and in
ensuring that those charged with serious criminal offences are tried
(R v. Crawley and Others [2014] EWCA Crim 1028 at para. [18]).

F

(ii) It is undesirable that the criminal process be interrupted or fragmented
by interlocutory proceedings. The considerations of public interest are
of great weight leaning in favour of expeditious resolution of
accusations of crime.

G

(iii) The undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process is not confined
to any particular part of the criminal process, but rather to the process
as a whole. Any interference with any part of the process is antithetical
to the proper and just disposition of criminal cases. The caution about
the undesirability of fragmentation of criminal process would be more
pronounced where a hearing of proceedings has actually commenced.

H

I

(iv) A stay of proceedings application will require especially compelling
justification in a case qualifying for urgent judicial decision. For
instance, it is important that anyone charged with serious criminal
offences be brought to trial expeditiously. Public interest would not be
served by allowing the defence to request for a delay. An accused of
serious criminal offences who is not guilty should have the
opportunity of clearing his name without excessive delay (Attorney
General’s Reference No. 2 of 2001 [2003] UKHL 68 at [16]).



586

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

(v) A stay of proceedings will not normally be granted pending an
interlocutory appeal in a criminal trial. It is only in very exceptional
or unusual circumstances that a stay order is granted. This is so even
if the issuing of the interlocutory appeal is not opposed by the
prosecution or in fact supported by both the prosecution and the
defence.
(vi) The accused’s rights over preliminary or interlocutory rulings made
by the trial judge are best vindicated by appeal after conviction, if any.
It is generally more desirable to consider preliminary or interlocutory
rulings made by the trial judge in appeal after conviction upon full trial
with the benefit of a concrete factual setting than considering them in
the abstract during interlocutory appeal.

A

B

C

(vii) The fact that an accused will be put to the expense of a trial is
irrelevant and would not qualify as “exceptional circumstances” to
justify a stay of a criminal trial pending resolution of an appeal.
D

(viii) The courts should exercise great caution in allowing other forms of
collateral challenge, in parallel proceedings such as an application for
a declaration or other form of judicial review with similar relief in the
nature of certiorari, be it commenced in the same court or another civil
or criminal court, which have the net effect of staying the criminal
proceedings or would interfere with or impinge directly upon the
normal course of proceedings in a criminal trial.
[33] Now, the accused is a public figure who stands charged with offences
which cannot by any means be described as trivial, allegedly committed
while he was holding office as Prime Minister. Public interest, and indeed
his personal interest, dictate that the trials against him should be commenced
expeditiously without any unreasonable delay as it is at the denouement of
the trial that the court is best-equipped to determine his guilt or otherwise
based on factual evidence instead of speculative arguments. Furthermore, he
has not established to our satisfaction that his application is so unusual or
exceptional that it falls within that class of cases which would justify the grant
of a stay. As stated above, a stay of criminal proceedings will only be granted
in the rarest of cases and the fact that the proceedings may be rendered a
nullity is not a special circumstance. In the context of an application for a
stay of proceedings, it is also immaterial that the accused is put to the expense
of a trial even if he is subsequently vindicated on appeal.
[34] We have not overlooked the respondent’s assertion that the appeal by
the appellant was incompetent since there was no appeal record and no
petition filed as required by the CJA. This is a non-issue because for criminal
proceedings, the record of appeal including the grounds of judgment of the
lower court is prepared by the court below (see: r. 91 of the Rules of the

Federal Court 1995). And without the grounds of judgment, the appellant
cannot proceed to file the petition of appeal (see: r. 95 of the Rules of the
Federal Court 1995). Accordingly, we do not think that the appellant is at
fault and in any case the incomplete appeal papers are no impediment to us
hearing the appeal proper as we are exercising our revisionary powers. At
any rate, the stay order granted by the Court of Appeal cannot be sustained
in the face of our elucidation on the correct test to be applied for a stay of
criminal proceedings.
[35] For the foregoing reasons we set aside the stay order of the criminal
trial granted by the Court of Appeal. Similarly the respondent’s oral
application for a stay of proceedings before us is dismissed in the absence of
any “exceptional or unusual circumstances”. The matter was therefore
remitted forthwith to the High Court to proceed with the criminal trial.
