to assist in investigation of corruption offence – Lawyers accompanied client to
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (‘MACC’) office to give statement – Notice
issued ordering lawyers to give statements – Whether notice an act of intimidation
– Whether notice issued mala fide or in bad faith – Whether MACC abused powers
in issuing notice – Whether criminal investigative process amenable to judicial
review – Whether actions or decisions of public authority in exercise of its powers
open to judicial review
CRIMINAL LAW: Corruption – Investigation – Lawyers accompanied client to
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (‘MACC’) office to give statement – Client
a complainant against suspect in commission of corruption offence – Whether
arts. 5(2) or 5(3) of Federal Constitution confers constitutional right on complainant
to be represented by counsel – Notice under s. 30(1)(a) of Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 ordering lawyers to give statements –
Whether notice an act of intimidation – Whether MACC abused powers in issuing
notice – Whether notice was for lawyers to assist in investigation of corruption
offence – Whether notice issued mala fide or in bad faith
A police report was lodged against the suspect, the Chairman of the National
Feedlot Corporation (‘the company’) by the complainant, an advisor to the
company. The complainant alleged, among others, was that the suspect had
exerted undue pressure on him to bribe the police as an inducement to close
the investigation into allegations of improprieties in the company. Pursuant
to the report, the first appellant, an anti-corruption body, summoned the
complainant to its office to assist in the investigations and to have his
statement recorded. The complainant went to the first appellant’s office to
give his statement with his lawyers, namely the respondents. The
respondents insisted that they be allowed to be present during the recording
of their client’s statement contending that their client had a constitutional
right to be represented by counsel. After recording the complainant’s
statement, the respondents were informed orally that they were also required

[2017] 10 CLJ

to give their statements in order to assist in the investigation. The
respondents protested and refused to do so. Hence, on the same day, the third
appellant, an investigation officer of the first appellant, issued a notice under
s. 30(1)(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009
(‘the Act’) to each respondent ordering both of them to be present at the first
appellant’s office on 23 March 2012 to be examined orally for the purposes
of assisting the first appellant in the investigation of an offence of corruption
under s. 16(b) of the Act. The respondents informed the first appellant in
writing that they would not be present at the first appellant’s office, as
directed. The respondents filed an application for leave to apply for judicial
review under O. 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (‘RHC’) for,
inter alia, an order of certiorari to quash the notice issued under s. 30(1)(a) of
the Act. The High Court granted the application and quashed the said notice
on the ground that it was issued as an act of intimidation against the
respondents acting as counsel for their client and an abuse of the appellants’
powers under the Act and therefore void and unlawful. The Court of Appeal
agreed with the High Court and dismissed the appellants’ appeal. The
appellants were granted leave to appeal to this court on the following
question of law: whether a criminal investigative process such as a notice of
investigation under s. 30(1)(a) of the Act was amenable to judicial review.
Held (allowing appeal)
Per Abu Samah Nordin FCJ delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) The respondents’ client was the complainant against a suspect in the
commission of a corruption offence under s. 16(b) of the Act. He was
a witness and not a suspect or an arrested person or a person ‘unlawfully
detained’. Thus, arts. 5(2) or 5(3) of the Federal Constitution does not
confer any constitutional right on the complainant to be represented by
counsel during the recording of his statement as a witness. (para 27)
(2) An allegation that the notice was issued as an act of intimidation or was
issued mala fide based on the unmeritorious contention that the
complainant had a constitutional right to be represented by counsel
during the recording of his statement as a witness could not be the basis
for quashing the notice issued under s. 30(1)(a) of the Act. The allegation
of mala fide against the appellants in issuing the notice was purely
because of the respondents’ sheer insistence that they be allowed to be
present during the recording of their client’s statement. What actually
happened was the reverse. The respondents had in fact been allowed to
be present although the appellants held the view that the respondents’
client had no constitutional right to be represented at that stage. There
was also no provision in the Act giving the solicitors the right to be
present during the recording of their client’s statement in the course of
investigation. (paras 30 & 34)

(3) The fact that the respondents did not interfere throughout the recording
of their client’s statement was no justification to hold that the appellants
had abused their powers in issuing the notice. In the first place, it had
not been shown that the respondents had any legal or constitutional basis
to be present. Nor was it shown that their client had a constitutional
right to be represented by counsel during the recording of their client’s
statement in the course of an investigation. There was no element of
surprise or ambush. The respondents had been informed in advance that
their statements may be recorded if they insisted on being present. They
opted to be present, holding steadfastly to their contention that their
client had a constitutional right to be represented. (para 31)
(4) Actions or decisions of a public authority in the exercise of its powers
in the course of criminal investigation or enquiry is not open to judicial
review. Therefore, the answer to the question posed to this court was
that the exercise of legitimate power, namely, the issuance of the notice
pursuant to s. 30(1)(a) of the Act by the first appellant through the third
appellant was not amenable to judicial review. The notice was issued in
order to assist the appellants in the investigation of a corruption offence
under s. 16(b) of the Act. To hold otherwise, would expose the criminal
investigative processes of all law enforcement agencies to constant
judicial review. On the facts of this case, the respondents failed to
establish that the notice was issued mala fide or in bad faith. (para 42)

Satu laporan polis dibuat terhadap suspek, Pengerusi National Feedlot
Corporation (‘syarikat’) oleh pengadu, iaitu penasihat kepada syarikat itu.
Pengadu mendakwa, antara lain, bahawa suspek telah menggunakan tekanan
tidak wajar ke atasnya untuk memberi rasuah kepada pihak polis sebagai
dorongan menutup siasatan terhadap dakwaan salah laku dalam syarikat.
Berikutan laporan itu, perayu pertama, sebuah badan anti rasuah, memanggil
pengadu ke pejabatnya bagi membantu siasatan dan untuk merakamkan
kenyataannya. Pengadu pergi ke pejabat perayu pertama untuk memberikan
kenyataan bersama dengan peguam-peguamnya, iaitu responden-responden.
Responden-responden menegaskan bahawa mereka dibenarkan hadir semasa
kenyataan anak guam mereka direkodkan dan menghujahkan bahawa anak
guam mereka mempunyai hak perlembagaan untuk diwakili peguam. Selepas
merakamkan kenyataan pengadu, responden-responden dimaklumkan secara
lisan bahawa mereka perlu memberikan kenyataan untuk membantu
siasatan. Responden-responden membantah dan enggan berbuat demikian.
Oleh itu, pada hari yang sama, perayu ketiga, pegawai penyiasat untuk
perayu pertama, mengeluarkan notis bawah s. 30(1)(a) Akta Suruhanjaya
Pencegahan Rasuah 2009 (‘Akta’) kepada setiap responden memerintahkan
mereka berdua hadir di pejabat perayu pertama pada 23 Mac 2012 untuk

perayu pertama, seperti diarahkan. Responden-responden memfailkan
permohonan untuk kebenaran memohon semakan kehakiman bawah A. 53
Kaedah-Kaedah Mahkamah Tinggi 1980 (‘KMT’) untuk, antara lain, satu
perintah certiorari membatalkan notis yang dikeluarkan bawah
s. 30(1)(a) Akta. Mahkamah Tinggi membenarkan permohonan dan
membatalkan notis tersebut atas alasan bahawa ia dikeluarkan sebagai satu
tindakan ugutan terhadap responden-responden selaku peguam bagi anak
guamnya dan satu salah guna kuasa perayu-perayu bawah Akta dan dengan
itu adalah terbatal dan melanggar undang-undang. Mahkamah Rayuan
bersetuju dengan Mahkamah Tinggi dan menolak rayuan perayu-perayu.
Perayu-perayu diberikan kebenaran untuk merayu ke mahkamah ini atas
persoalan undang-undang berikut: sama ada proses penyiasatan jenayah

kehakiman.

Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan)
Oleh Abu Samah Nordin HMP menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah:
(1) Anak guam responden adalah pengadu terhadap suspek dalam perlakuan
kesalahan rasuah bawah s. 16(b) Akta. Dia adalah saksi dan bukan
suspek atau orang yang ditahan atau orang yang ‘ditahan secara tak sah’.
Oleh itu, per. 5(2) atau 5(3) Perlembagaan Persekutuan tidak memberi
apa-apa hak perlembagaan atas pengadu untuk diwakili peguam semasa
rakaman kenyataannya sebagai saksi.
(2) Dakwaan bahawa notis yang dikeluarkan adalah tindakan ugutan atau
dikeluarkan secara mala fide berdasarkan hujahan tidak bermerit bahawa
pengadu mempunyai hak perlembagaan untuk diwakili oleh peguam
semasa rakaman kenyataannya sebagai saksi tidak boleh menjadi dasar
membatalkan notis yang dikeluarkan bawah s. 30(1)(a) Akta. Dakwaan
mala fide terhadap perayu-perayu dalam mengeluarkan notis adalah
semata-mata kerana responden-responden begitu tegas agar mereka
dibenarkan hadir semasa merakamkan kenyataan anak guam mereka.
Apa yang sebenarnya berlaku adalah sebaliknya. Responden-responden
telah dibenarkan hadir walaupun perayu-perayu berpendapat bahawa
anak guam responden-responden tidak mempunyai hak perlembagaan
untuk diwakili peguam pada peringkat ini. Tiada juga peruntukan dalam
Akta yang memberikan hak kepada peguam-peguam untuk hadir semasa
rakaman kenyataan anak guam dalam siasatan.
(3) Fakta bahawa responden-responden tidak membuat sebarang gangguan
semasa kenyataan anak guamnya dirakamkan bukanlah justifikasi untuk
memutuskan bahawa perayu-perayu telah salah guna kuasa dalam

untuk hadir. Juga tidak ditunjukkan bahawa anak guamnya mempunyai
hak perlembagaan untuk diwakili oleh peguam semasa kenyataan anak
guamnya dirakamkan semasa siasatan. Tiada elemen mengejutkan atau
serangan hendap. Responden-responden dimaklumkan terlebih dahulu
bahawa kenyataan mereka mungkin dirakamkan jika mereka berkeras
untuk menghadirkan diri. Mereka memilih untuk hadir, berpegang teguh
pada hujah mereka bahawa anak guam mereka mempunyai hak
perlembagaan untuk diwakili.
(4) Tindakan atau keputusan pihak berkuasa awam dalam pelaksanaan
kuasa mereka semasa siasatan jenayah atau pertanyaan tidak terbuka
pada semakan kehakiman. Oleh itu, jawapan kepada soalan yang
diajukan oleh mahkamah ini adalah bahawa dalam menjalankan kuasa
yang sah, iaitu, pengeluaran notis menurut s. 30(1)(a) Akta oleh perayu
pertama melalui perayu ketiga tidak tertakluk pada semakan kehakiman.
Notis dikeluarkan untuk membantu perayu-perayu dalam siasatan
kesalahan rasuah bawah s. 16(b) Akta. Memutuskan sebaliknya, akan
mendedahkan proses siasatan jenayah semua agensi penguatkuasaan
undang-undang kepada semakan kehakiman berterusan. Berdasarkan
fakta kes ini, responden-responden gagal membuktikan bahawa notis
yang dikeluarkan adalah mala fide atau dengan niat jahat.

JUDGMENT

E

Abu Samah Nordin FCJ:
[1]
This is an appeal by the appellants against the decision of the Court
of Appeal which dismissed their appeal and affirmed the decision of the
Kuala Lumpur High Court. The first appellant is an anti-corruption body
specially established under the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act
2009 (‘the Act’) to promote integrity and accountability in the public and
private sector. It is equipped with wide powers to investigate into and
prosecute offences of corruption under the Act and certain offences,
described as “prescribed offence” under the Penal Code, Customs Act 1967
and Election Offences Act 1954. The second appellant is the Government of
Malaysia, which is a nominal party to this action. The third appellant is the
investigation officer of the first appellant with the rank of an assistant
superintendent.
[2]
The appellants are dissatisfied that their notice under s. 30(1)(a) of the
Act, directing the respondents to be present at the first appellant’s office to
be orally examined for purposes of assisting the first appellant in an
investigation of a corruption offence under the Act was set aside by the High
Court.

Facts In Brief
[3]
On 27 January 2012 one Shamsubahrin bin Ismail (‘the complainant’)
lodged a police report against Dato’ Seri Salleh bin Ismail (‘the suspect’) who
was the Chairman of National Feedlot Corporation (‘the company’). The
complainant was an advisor to the company. The complainant alleged,
among others, that the suspect had exerted undue pressure on him, through
telephone and SMS to bribe the police as an inducement to close the
investigation into allegations of improprieties in the company.
[4]
Pursuant to the report, the first appellant summoned the complainant
to its office to assist in the investigation and to have his statement recorded.
On 19 March 2012 the complainant went to the first appellant’s office to give
his statement. He came with his lawyers, namely the respondents.
[5]
The respondents insisted that they be allowed to be present during the
recording of their client’s statement, contending that their client had a
constitutional right to be represented by counsel. The first appellant objected
to their presence and indicated to them that there was no provision in the Act
giving them any right to be present. Owing to the respondents’
uncompromising insistence and tense situation, the first appellant finally
relented and allowed them to be present. But they were informed in advance
that there may be a need to record their statements as well.
[6]
After recording the complainant’s statement, the respondents were
informed orally that they were also required to give their statements in order
to assist in the investigation. The respondents protested and refused to give
their statements.

F

G

[7]
Hence, on the same day, that is, 19 March 2012 the third appellant
issued a notice under s. 30(1)(a) of the Act to each respondent ordering both
of them to be present at the first appellant’s office on 23 March 2012 to be
examined orally for the purposes of assisting the first appellant in the
investigation of an offence of corruption under s. 16(b) of the Act. Section
16(b) of the Act makes it an offence for any person, by himself or in
conjunction with any other person, who corruptly gives, promises or offers
to any person any gratification as an inducement or reward on account of:
(a) any person doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter
or transaction; or

H

(b) any officer of a public body doing or forbearing to do anything in respect
of any matter or transaction.

I

[8]
Under s. 30(6) of the Act it is mandatory to comply with the said
notice, notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to the contrary and
anyone who contravenes the notice to be present and to be orally examined
commits an offence, punishable with a fine not exceeding RM10,000 or to
imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both (s. 69 of the Act).

[2017] 10 CLJ

[9]
On 22 March 2012, three days after being served with the notice, the
respondents informed the first appellant in writing that they would not be
present at the first appellant’s office, as directed.
[10] On 30 April 2012 the respondents filed an application for leave to
apply for judicial review under O. 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980
(RHC) for the following reliefs:

A

B

(i) for an order of certiorari to quash the notice issued under s. 30(1)(a) of
the Act;
(ii) for a declaration that the said notice is unlawful, ultra vires and/or an
abuse of powers under the Act;

C

(iii) for a declaration that the first appellant had no power to record the
statement of solicitors who represented their client during the recording
of their client’s statement. Leave was granted.
[11] After hearing the substantive motion, the High Court granted the
application for judicial review and quashed the said notice on the ground that
it was issued as an act of intimidation against the respondents acting as
counsel for their client and an abuse of the appellants’ powers under the Act
and therefore void and unlawful.
[12] The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal against the decision of
the High Court. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants’ appeal. It
agreed with the High Court that the issuance of the notice was clearly an act
of intimidation and an abuse of the first and third appellants’ powers under
the Act. It further held that the notice was not issued in good faith. The Court
of Appeal held the view that the discretionary power to issue the notice under
s. 30(1)(a) of the Act is not an unfettered discretion but subject to a stringent
requirement that it must, as the Federal Court in Pengarah Tanah dan Galian,
Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd [1978] 1 LNS 143;
[1979] 1 MLJ 135 held, be exercised for a proper purpose and not
unreasonably, having regard to all relevant considerations and disregard all
improper considerations.

[13] On 6 April 2015 the appellants were granted leave to appeal to this

under section 30(1)(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act 2009 is
amenable to judicial review.

Section 30(1)(a) of the Act states:

Submissions Before This Court

G

H

[16] The crux of the appellants’ contention is that the issuance of the notice
to the respondents is not amenable to judicial review as it was issued by the
first appellant through the third appellant in exercise of her statutory power
granted by s. 30(1)(a) of the Act. Section 30(1)(a) of the Act confers a
discretion on the officer of the first appellant to order any person, who in his
or her opinion may be able to assist in the investigation of an offence under
the Act, to be present and to be examined orally. The notice was issued in
order to assist the first appellant in the investigation of a corruption offence
under s. 16(b) of the Act. The issuance of the notice was merely an
administrative decision made in the course of an investigation. It is
contended that an application for judicial review under O. 53 r. 2(4) of the
RHC 1980 can only be made by a person who is adversely affected by the
decision of any public authority. Hence, not all decisions and actions of a
public officer are reviewable under O. 53 r. 2(4) of the RHC. At the time
the notice was issued there was no decision made by the first appellant on
the outcome of the investigation as it was still in the midst of investigation
of the alleged offence.
[17]

I

It was held in R v. Sloan [1990] 1 NZLR 474 that:

Secondly, ... it is not every decision made under the statutory authority
that is subject to review. A decision must go beyond what is merely
administrative or procedural ... or the exercise of a function rather than
a power ... Quite plainly, the conclusions reached by the inspectors here
are of this kind and so are not reviewable. To hold otherwise, would as



10

Current Law Journal

[2017] 10 CLJ

Mr Neave submitted, open up the investigative process of all enforcement
agencies to constant judicial review; and that cannot have been the
intention of Parliament.

A

It is contended that the decision to issue the notice was merely an
administrative decision and therefore is not subject to judicial review.
[18] The appellants also relied on the following authorities in support of
their contention that the notice is not amenable to judicial review: Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal v. Bond and Others [1990] 94 ALR 11, Tan Eng Chye v.
Director of Prisons (No. 2) [2004] SLR 521, Empayar Changgih Sdn Bhd v. Ketua
Pengarah Bahagian Penguakuasa Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam Negeri & Hal
Ehwal Pengguna Malaysia & Ors, Civil Appeal No. 01(f)-21-09-2012(W) and
Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan & Ors v. Tan Boon Wah [2010] 6 CLJ 142;
[2010] 3 MLJ 193.
[19] Mr Puravalen, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that it
was an act of intimidation and an abuse of powers to issue the notice to the
respondents who merely acted as counsel during the recording of their
client’s statement. It was a violation of their client’s fundamental right to
counsel under art. 5 of the Federal Constitution to deny their presence.
Further, there was no nexus between the offence being investigated and the
respondents, who only acted as counsel for their client. The respondents also
alleged that the notice was issued mala fide and not in good faith.
[20] Learned counsel for the respondents reminded us of the Federal
Court’s observation in Pengarah Tanah dan Galian Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri
Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which the Court of Appeal in the instant case had
rightly followed, that the discretion conferred by law is not an unfettered
discretion and must not be exercised for an improper purpose or
unreasonably. It would be an abuse of power to issue the notice, as in this
case, under the guise of investigation, to the respondents who merely
represented their client, whose right to counsel is entrenched in the Federal
Constitution, during the recording of their client’s statement as a witness.
The notice was clearly an act of intimidation to the respondents as the High
Court had found that there was no evidence of interference by counsel during
the recording of their client’s statement.
[21] Learned counsel cited to us the decision of the Singapore Court of
Appeal in Manjit Singh Kirpal Singh & Another v. Attorney General [2013]
2 SLR 844 where the court stated that delay occasioned by the review
application per se was not a sufficient basis to exclude judicial review. In that
case, the applicant sought to quash the decision of the Chief Justice in the
appointment of a member of disciplinary tribunal under s. 90(1) of the Legal
Profession Act (Cap 161). The court dismissed the originating summons on
the ground that the power conferred by s. 90(1) of the LPA was clearly
administrative and it was not conferred on the Chief Justice in his judicial
capacity. That is not a case in favour of the respondents.

[22] Learned counsel for the respondents also cited the following cases
where it was submitted that questionable exercise of discretion or abuse of
powers by the public authority had been challenged in courts: Savrimuthu
Sinnapan v. PP [1987] 1 CLJ 368; [1987] CLJ (Rep) 322; [1987] 2 MLJ 173,
Kerajaan Negeri Selangor & Ors v. Sagong Tasi & Ors [2005] 4 CLJ 169; [2005]
6 MLJ 289, Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs [1988] 2 SLR (R) 525
and Reg v. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, Ex parte Chetnik
Developments Ltd [1988] AC 858.
[23] It was further submitted that the decision of this court in Empayar
Changgih Sdn Bhd’s case that the exercise of power in the course of
investigation is not open to review is only a general principle of law which
is subject to exceptions where there is dishonesty, bad faith or presence of
some other exceptional circumstance as pointed out in R v. Director of Public
Prosecutions ex p Kebeline [2000] 2 AC 326 or in appropriate cases, where the
action of the executive is inconsistent with the constitution and the law or
in any manner arbitrary, irrational or mala fides or an abuse of power as was
clarified by this court in Dr Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj v. Peguam Negara
Malaysia [2013] 2 CLJ 1009; [2013] 2 MLJ 321.

[24] The sole question of law for the court’s determination is whether a
criminal investigative process such as a notice of investigation under
s. 30(1)(a) of the Act is amenable to judicial review. The appellants contend
that it is not amenable to judicial review. The respondents, on the other hand,
contend that it is amenable to judicial review and that the decision of this
court in Empayar Changgih Sdn Bhd’s case that an exercise of power in the
course of criminal investigation is not open to judicial review under O. 53
of the RHC is however subject to the exceptions that it is not tainted by
claims of dishonesty, bad faith or other exceptional circumstance as was held
in Reg v. DPP exp Kebilene or where, to quote the decision of this court in
Dr Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj’s case “the policy or action of the executive is
inconsistent with the constitution and the law or in any manner arbitrary,
irrational or there are elements of mala fides and abuse of power”. In short,
the decision of the public authority in the course of criminal investigation or
the decision of the executive is not totally unreviewable by way of judicial
review.
[25] Reg v. DPP exp Kebilene was not considered in Empayar Changgih Sdn
Bhd’s case and that both cases were also not considered in Dr Michael
Jeyakumar Devaraj’s case. In that case, the Federal Court spelt out the
circumstances where policy or executive decisions may be open to judicial
review. Whether or not the court should interfere however depend on the
facts of each case. In Reg v. DPP exp Kebilene, Lord Steyn at p. 371 said:
My Lords, I would rule that absent dishonesty or mala fides or an
exceptional circumstance, the decision of the Director to consent to the
prosecution of the applicants is not amenable to judicial review.

[26] The foremost reason, if not the sole reason, that triggered the
respondents’ application for a declaration that the notice is unlawful and void
is because they claim that it is an abuse of powers by the appellants and an
act of intimidation against counsel who insisted to be present during the
recording of their client’s statement as a witness. It was the respondents’
assertion that their client had a constitutional right under art. 5 of the Federal
Constitution to be represented by counsel, without however specifying which
part of art. 5 that applies to their client.
[27] Article 5(2) of the Constitution speaks of the right of a person who is
being unlawfully detained to make a complaint to the High Court. This is a
provision where a person claiming to be unlawfully detained, ordinarily
applies for a writ of habeas corpus. Article 5(3) speaks of a right of an arrested
person to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. The
respondents’ client is the complainant against a suspect in the commission of
a corruption offence under s. 16(b) of the Act. He is a witness and not a
suspect or an arrested person or a person ‘unlawfully detained’. So art. 5(2)
or 5(3) of the Constitution does not confer any constitutional right on the
complainant to be represented by counsel during the recording of his
statement as a witness. Learned counsel’s contention that their client has a
constitutional right under art. 5 to be represented by counsel is just a bare
assertion. Not a single authority is cited to us to back up such contention.
[28] In In Re Groban 352 US 330 (1957) the Ohio Supreme Court had to
decide whether the witnesses (appellants) had a constitutional right under the
due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the assistance of their own
counsel in giving testimony as witnesses at a proceeding conducted by the
Ohio State Fire Marshall to investigate the causes of fire. The Ohio Supreme
Court held (by a majority of five against four) that the appellants had no
constitutional right to be assisted by counsel in giving testimony at the
investigatory proceeding conducted by the Fire Marshall.

Mr Justice Reed who delivered the majority opinion of the court said:

The proceeding before the Fire Marshal was not a criminal trial, nor was
it an administrative proceeding that would in any way adjudicate
appellants’ responsibilities for the fire. It was a proceeding solely to elicit
facts relating to the causes and circumstances of the fire. The Fire
Marshal’s duty was to “determine whether the fire was the result of
carelessness or design”, and to arrest any person against whom there was
sufficient evidence on which to base a charge of arson.
The fact that appellants were under a legal duty to speak and that their
testimony might provide a basis for criminal charges against them does
not mean that they had a constitutional right to the assistance of their
counsel. Appellants here are witnesses from whom information was
sought as to the cause of the fire. A witness before a grand jury cannot
insist, as a matter of constitutional right, on being represented by his

counsel, nor can a witness before other investigatory bodies. There is no
more reason to allow the presence of counsel before a Fire Marshal trying
in the public interest to determine the cause of a fire. Obviously in these
situations evidence obtained may possibly lay a witness open to criminal
charges. When such charges are made in a criminal proceeding, he then
may demand the presence of his counsel for his defence. Until then, his
protection is the privilege against self-incrimination.

[30] An allegation that the notice was issued as an act of intimidation or
was issued mala fide based on unmeritorious contention that the complainant
had a constitutional right to be represented by counsel during the recording
of his statement as a witness cannot be the basis for quashing the notice issued
under s. 30(1)(a) of the Act.
[31] The fact that the respondents did not interfere throughout the
recording of their client’s statement is no justification to hold that the
appellants had abused their powers in issuing the notice. In the first place,
it had not been shown that the respondents had any legal or constitutional
basis to be present. Nor was it shown that their client had a constitutional
right to be represented by counsel during the recording of their client’s
statement in the course of an investigation. There was no element of surprise
or ambush. The respondents had been informed in advance that their
statements may be recorded if they insisted on being present. They opted to
be present, holding steadfastly to their contention that their client had a
constitutional right to be represented.
[32] The appellant categorically denied that the notice was issued mala fide
or in bad faith. The burden is on the respondents to show that the notice was
issued in bad faith. Mere suspicion is not sufficient. The case of Yeap Hock
Seng @ Ah Meng v. Minister For Home Affairs, Malaysia [1975] 2 MLJ 279 is
an illustration that it would be an uphill task to prove an allegation of mala
fide. In that case, the applicant applied for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that
he was unlawfully detained and that his detention was made mala fide.
[33] Abdoolcader J in dismissing the application for habeas corpus at p. 248
said:
The onus of proving mala fides on the part of the detaining authority is
on the applicant and is normally extremely difficult to discharge as what
is required is proof of improper or bad motive in order to invalidate the
detention order for male fides and not mere suspicion ...
It might perhaps be open to the applicant to suggest that the circumstances
surrounding his case might possibly relate to some suspicion of mala fides
but this cannot be taken for granted or considered sufficient proof by
itself.

[34] In the instant appeal, the allegation of mala fide against the appellants
in issuing the notice was purely because of the respondents’ sheer insistence
that they be allowed to be present during the recording of their client’s
statement. What actually happened was the reverse. The respondents had in
fact been allowed to be present although the appellants held the view that the
respondents’ client had no constitutional right to be represented at that stage.
There is also no provision in the Act giving the solicitors the right to be
present during the recording of their client’s statement in the course of
investigation.
[35] The Court of Appeal which relied on the decision of this court in
Pengarah Tanah dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn
Bhd [1978] 1 LNS 143, in holding that the notice was void on the ground
that the appellants had exercised their discretion wrongly or unreasonably
and not in good faith had quoted the observation made by Raja Azlan Shah
Ag CJ (as he then was) out of context. In that case, the registered owner of
the land who held title in perpetuity surrendered its land for purposes of
subdivision and realienation. The appellant, in communicating the decision
of the land executive committee stated that the approval for subdivision and
realienation, was subject to the condition that the land would be realienated
not in perpetuity but for a lease of 99 years, which the respondent seriously
objected. The Federal Court held that the Government had no power to make
the registered proprietor give up its freehold title and receive in exchange a
99-year lease. It was in that context that prompted Raja Azlan Shah, Ag CJ,
to make the following observation:
Every legal power must have legal limits, otherwise there is dictatorship.
In particular, it is a stringent requirement that a discretion should be
exercised for a proper purpose, and it should not be exercised
unreasonably. In other words, every discretion cannot be free from legal
restraints. Where it is wrongly exercised, it becomes the duty of the courts
to intervene. I would once again emphasise what has been said before,
that ‘public bodies must be compelled to observe the law and it is essential
that bureaucracy should be kept in its place’.

[36] It is wholly inappropriate to equate the decision of the third appellant
in exercising her discretion in issuing the notice under s. 30(1)(a) of the Act
with the decision of the Government in Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd’s case.
In the instant appeal, the third appellant is expressly empowered by law to
issue the notice whereas in Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd’s case the land
executive committee had no power in law to order the registered landowner
to give up its freehold title to the land and receive in exchange a leasehold
title of 99 years.
[37] The weight of authorities tend to support the view that the actions or
decisions of a public authority in exercise of its legitimate powers at the
investigative stage are not amenable to judicial review. In R v. Sloan [1990]
1 NZLR 474, Sloan was convicted under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977

for operating an illegal game of chance by using certain machines. After his
conviction, he converted the use of those machines to a prize competition,
which is outside the scope of the Act. But the Inspectors of Gaming still
considered the new scheme an illegal game and issued letters to Sloan to
cease operations forthwith, coupled with a threat of enforcement. Sloan then
applied for a review under the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and sought
a declaration that the new scheme was lawful under the Gaming and
Lotteries Act 1977 and that no enforcement actions should be taken against
him. The High Court dismissed the application for review, holding that the
decision of the inspectors was not subject to review.
[38] R v. Sloan was favourably considered in City Growth Sdn Bhd & Anor
v. The Government of Malaysia [2005] 7 CLJ 422. In the latter case, the
applicants (City Growth Sdn Bhd & Anor) applied for leave under O. 53
r. 3 of the RHC for an order of certiorari to quash the order issued by the
Deputy Public Prosecutor under s. 50(1) of Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing And Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2011
(AMLA) directing the banks not to part with or deal in or otherwise dispose
of the movable property, including any monetary instrument in the name of
the applicants, based on information pursuant to investigation that the
movable property is related to commission of an offence under s. 4 of the
AMLA. The High Court dismissed the leave application, holding that the
order of the DPP was not amenable to judicial review. If all decisions and
actions of public authority of this nature are amendable to review, the
government machinery may not be able to function smoothly as the
investigation process of all enforcement agencies would be open to constant
judicial review. The High Court in City Growth Sdn Bhd’s case had in turn
followed its earlier decision in Ahmad Azam Mohamad Salleh & Others v.
Jabatan Pembangunan Koperasi Malaysia & Ors [2004] 4 MLJ 86 where it held
that the result of the inspection under the Cooperative Societies Act 1983 was
not amenable to judicial review.
[39] The decision in City Growth Sdn Bhd’s case was cited and approved by
this court in Empayar Changgih Sdn Bhd’s case. The appellant, Empayar
Changgih Sdn Bhd, was in the business of manufacturing video compact
discs, which was licensed under the Optical Discs Act 2000 (Act 606). A raid
was conducted at the new office of the appellant based on information that
an offence under the Act could have been committed. During the raid,
certain machines and equipment were seized and removed from the
premises, causing some damage to the machines and equipment. The
appellant filed an application for an order of certiorari against the respondents
to quash the decision of the second respondent who refused to release the
seized machines and equipment, and for an order of mandamus to compel the
second respondent to release and return the seized machines and equipment.

[2017] 10 CLJ

[40] Before the hearing of the judicial review application, the prayers were
amended, limiting the reliefs only for a declaration that the seizure of the
machines and equipment was done without reasonable cause. The High
Court dismissed the application holding that, on the facts, the raid and
seizure was based on a reasonable cause in exercise of an investigative
function. Its decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant
was granted leave to appeal to this court against the decision of the Court of
Appeal. One of the questions of law posed was:
Whether in a judicial review application which challenges the validity of
the respondent’s decision ... to seize any article, optical disc, thing, book
or document under section 38(7) of the Act 606, it is necessary for the
Respondents to justify the need for such seizure as being reasonably
necessary in the context of the purpose for which the raid was conducted.

[41] The appeal was dismissed by this court. It was held in that case that
an exercise of power in the course of a criminal investigation is not open to
judicial review under O. 53 RHC. To hold otherwise would be exposing the
criminal investigative process of all law enforcement agencies in the country
to constant judicial review which surely could not have been the intention
of Parliament. It was also held that the seizure was made in the course of a
criminal investigation of an offence pursuant to the powers conferred by the
Act. Such seizure was not amenable to judicial review. The appellant could
have filed a writ action for damages.
[42] The general conclusion that can be drawn from the cases referred to
above is that the actions or decisions of a public authority in exercise of its
powers in the course of criminal investigation or enquiry is not open to
judicial review. Therefore, the answer to the question posed to this court is
that the exercise of legitimate power, namely, the issuance of the notice
pursuant to s. 30(1)(a) of the Act by the first appellant through the third
appellant is not amenable to judicial review. The notice was issued in order
to assist the appellants in the investigation of a corruption offence under
s. 16(b) of the Act. To hold otherwise, would expose the criminal
investigative processes of all law enforcement agencies to constant judicial
review. On the facts of this case, the respondents failed to establish that the
notice was issued mala fide or in bad faith.
[43] It seemed that the decision of the High Court in quashing the notice
was based on the respondents’ contention that their client has a constitutional
right to be represented by counsel during the recording of their client’s
statement. The High Court relied on the decision of this court in Hashim Saud
v. Yahaya Hashim & Anor [1977] 1 LNS 32; [1977] 2 MLJ 116. This is what
Her Ladyship said in para. 19 (CLJ); para. 7 (MLJ) of her judgment:
In this case, I am of the opinion that there is no doubt that the issuance
of the said notice affect the rights of the applicants and also their
obligation as lawyers representing their clients. As the learned counsel for
the applicants had put it, it is direct interference with the exercise of their
duty to their client.

[44] Hashim Saud’s case is not an authority that solicitors had a
constitutional right to represent their client during the recording of the
client’s statement. The Federal Court’s decision in Hashim Saud’s case was
in respect of an arrested person’s right of access to counsel. It was held in
that case that the right to counsel of a person remanded under s. 117 of the
Criminal Procedure Code started from the day of his arrest but it could not
be exercised immediately if it impedes police investigation or the
administration of justice.
[45] For the aforesaid reasons, we allow the appeal by the appellants and
set aside the orders of the courts below. We make no order as to costs.
