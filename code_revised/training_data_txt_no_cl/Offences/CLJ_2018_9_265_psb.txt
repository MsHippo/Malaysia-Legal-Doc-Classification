The complainant, an Indonesian woman, was employed by the accused as a
domestic help. Roughly a week after her employment, the accused started
abusing the complainant and this happened everyday. According to the
complainant, she was kicked, assaulted with a cloth’s hanger, book, an
umbrella, a steel mop rod and a kitchen knife. The complainant finally
bolted and was found semi-conscious near a drain within the same housing
area. The accused was initially charged at the Sessions Court for attempted
murder, an offence under s. 307 of the Penal Code (‘the PC’). The
complainant had written to the Attorney-General (‘the AG’), expressing her
intention not to proceed with the case and wanted to withdraw her police
report. However, the application was rejected and the trial commenced.

After ten witnesses were called, the prosecution tendered an amended charge
under s. 326 of the PC, for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous
weapons or means (‘the amended charge’). The accused pleaded guilty to the
amended charge and was convicted. In mitigation, the accused submitted
that, inter alia, (i) she regretted her actions and was remorseful; (ii) the
complainant had wanted to withdraw her police report and did not wish to
pursue the matter; (iii) she was emotionally-distressed; (iv) she had
undergone a surgery and was attending physiotherapy; and (v) she had
pleaded guilty. The accused prayed to be placed under a bond of good
behaviour under s. 294(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘the CPC’). The
prosecution pressed for a deterrent sentence based on the element of public
interest. Having heard the mitigating factors, the Sessions Court Judge (‘the
SCJ’) directed that the accused be released on her entering into a bond with
one surety in the sum of RM20,000 for a period of five years. Hence, the
present application for revision by the prosecution on the ground that the
sentence was manifestly and grossly inadequate. In support of the
application, the prosecution submitted that the SCJ failed to consider
(i) s. 294(1) of the CPC had ceased to be applicable to serious offences vide
Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 2016 (‘the Act’); (ii) the
prosecution called ten witnesses; (iii) the seriousness of the injuries sustained
by the complainant; (iv) the element of public interest; (v) the image of the
country was smeared and the diplomatic relationship between Malaysia and
Indonesia was badly affected; and (vi) the rampancy of cases involving maid
abuse. The accused raised a preliminary objection of whether a revision was
appropriate when a notice of appeal had been filed. The accused further
sought a stay of execution of the sentence pending appeal.

A

Held (setting aside order of binding over and substituting it with sentence
of eight years’ imprisonment):

F

(1) There is no judicial pronouncement that once a notice of appeal is filed,
an application for a revision could not be done. The prosecution had
chosen to proceed with the application for revision. Therefore, the
preliminary objection was dismissed. The application for stay was also
refused. (paras 19, 20 & 54)
(2) The amendment in the Act would not be applicable to this case as the
offence was committed on 21 December 2016. The Act came into force
on 1 March 2017. As criminal law and punishment are involved, the
amendment does not apply to any serious offence committed prior to the
said date. To argue otherwise would offend art. 7(1) of the Federal
Constitution. (paras 10 & 23)

(3) The fact that the complainant wished not to pursue could not be a factor
to be considered. A police report could not be withdrawn or revoked but
a complainant may appeal to the AG not to proceed with the prosecution
of the accused person and it is solely the prerogative of the AG to
institute or decline a prosecution. This is because once a person decides
to lodge a police report against another for a wrong committed by the
latter, the matter is no longer under the former’s control. It is no longer
his or her case but a case by the State, under the control of the AG. A
prosecution will ensue if there is sufficient evidence to prove the offence
alleged. However, a private prosecution may be taken up by an
individual if the AG declines to prosecute in cases involving nonseizable offences. For this reason, the fact that the complainant wished
not to pursue was not a factor to be considered for the application of
s. 294(1) of the CPC. (paras 13 & 14)
(4) The accused person pleaded guilty after ten witnesses took the stand.
The original charge proffered against her was one under s. 307 of the PC
which carries a maximum term of 20 years’ imprisonment. The charge
was amended to s. 326 of the PC which provides for a similar term of
maximum imprisonment and liable to a fine or to whipping. Being a
female, she could not be whipped. Hence, there was practically no
difference in terms of the sentence that could be imposed but she chose
to claim trial under the earlier charge. Although she pleaded guilty when
the charge was amended, this could not be a strong mitigating factor.
(para 34)
(5) No doubt the accused was a first offender but the gravity and the
seriousness of the offence committed would outweigh that mitigating
factor. Furthermore, the emotional distress which resulted in poor
health causing a surgery to be performed and to be followed by
physiotherapy was not something that existed before the offence was
committed but as a result of the four-day remand after she was arrested.
(para 39)
(6) For an offence of causing grievous hurt, the injuries inflicted are the
utmost important factor that would guide the court in assessing the
sentence. In this case, out of the eight kinds of hurt designated as
grievous enumerated under s. 320 of the Penal Code, the hurt sustained
by the complainant fell under para. (g) – ‘fracture or dislocation of a
bone’. However, a fracture caused by an instrument which, used as a
weapon of offence, is likely to cause death ie, the steel mop rod had
satisfied the elements of s. 326 of the CPC. (paras 52 & 53)

[1]
The accused person was earlier charged with attempted murder under
s. 307 of the Penal Code (“PC”) and she claimed trial. Based on the record
of proceedings on 17 April 2017 the court below was informed that the
complainant had written in to the Attorney General expressing her intention
not to proceed with the case and wanted to withdraw her police report. The
case was then postponed to 9 May 2017. On 9 May 2017 the learned Deputy
Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) informed the court below that the Attorney
General had rejected the complainant’s application and the trial thereafter
commenced with the complainant herself being called to take the stand.
[2]
After having ten witnesses called the prosecution tendered an amended
charge pursuant to a representation submitted by the accused person. The
amended charge was one under s. 326 of the PC an offence of voluntarily
causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means. The amended charge
reads as follows:
Bahawa kamu pada 21/12/2016 antara jam 0700hrs sehingga jam lebih
kurang 1200hrs di dalam rumah beralamat No 62, Jalan PJU 7/30, Mutiara
Damansara, Damansara, Petaling Jaya, dalam Daerah Petaling, dalam
Negeri Selangor Darul Ehsan, dengan sengaja telah menyebabkan cedera
parah ke atas seorang perempuan warganegara Indonesia yang bernama
Suyanti binti Sutrinso, No Passport: B 5682910 dengan menggunakan
sebilah pisau berhulu biru, sebatang pengelap lantai, sekaki payung,
sebatang rod besi warna biru, sebatang alat mainan kucing dan satu
penyangkut baju warna putih yang digunakan sebagai senjata untuk
menyerang dengan itu kamu telah melakukan satu kesalahan yang boleh
dihukum di bawah seksyen 326 Kanun Keseksaan.

This charge was tendered on 8 January 2018 and the accused person
claimed trial but decided to plead guilty after the matter was stood down.
The learned Sessions Court Judge thereafter postponed the case to 11 January
2018 and subsequently postponed to 15 February 2018 and finally the
continued hearing of the case was fixed on 14 March 2018.

A

[4]
On 14 March 18 the amended charge was read over and explained to
the accused person and she maintained her guilty plea. Thereafter the facts
were read and the exhibits were tendered and she admitted to the same.
Having satisfied that the accused person understood the nature and
consequences of the plea and admitted to the facts and the exhibits tendered,
the learned Sessions Court Judge accepted the plea of guilt and entered a
conviction and called upon the parties to submit on the sentence.

C

[5]
Both parties referred to their written submissions respectively. In
mitigation she advanced the following factors:
(a) Married with no children and a full time homemaker;

D

(b) She cooperated with the police and never failed to attend the hearings;
(c) She regretted her action and remorseful;
(d) The complainant had wanted to withdraw her police report and did not
wish to pursue this matter;

E

(e) She was emotionally distressed;
(f) She had undergone a surgery and attending physiotherapy; and
(g) She had pleaded guilty.
[6]
Learned counsel prayed that the accused be placed under a bond of
good behaviour under sub-s. 294(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code
(“CPC”).
[7]
In response the learned DPP pressed for a deterrent sentence based on
the element of public interest. It was also pointed out that the fact that the
complainant did not want to pursue was irrelevant and that the prosecution
could still proceed with the case. The learned DPP did address the court
below on the amendment to sub-s. 294(6) of the CPC.
[8]
Having heard the mitigating factors and reply from the prosecution,
the learned Sessions Court Judge directed that the accused person be released
on her entering into a bond with one surety in the sum of RM20,000 for a
period of five years.
[9]
On 19 March 2018 the learned DPP wrote in to the High Court
seeking a revision over the sentence imposed by the learned Sessions Court
Judge on 15 March 2018. The grounds cited in support of the application
were briefly as follows:

(i) Subsection 294(1) of the CPC has ceased to be applicable to serious
offences vide Act A1521 and the learned Sessions Court Judge had failed
to take this fact into consideration;
(ii) The learned Sessions Court Judge had failed to consider:
(a) the prosecution had called ten witnesses;

B

(b) the seriousness of the injuries sustained by the complainant;
(c) the element of public interest;
(d) the image of the country is smeared and the diplomatic relationship

(e) the rampancy of cases involving maid abuse.

D

E

F

G

[10] Having read Act A1521, I do not think that the amendment would be
applicable to this case as the offence was committed on 21 December 2016.
Nevertheless, bearing in mind the cases of Liaw Kwai Wah & Anor v. PP
[1987] 1 CLJ 35; [1987] CLJ (Rep) 163; [1987] 2 MLJ 69; Philip Lau Chee
Heng v. PP [1988] 2 CLJ 873; [1988] 2 CLJ (Rep) 144; [1988] 3 MLJ 107;
and PP v. Muhari Mohd Jani & Anor [1999] 8 CLJ 430; [1996] 3 MLJ 116,
I could still call for the record of proceedings to look at the correctness or
propriety of the sentence. Therefore, I called up for the same to be
transmitted. The brief reason stated by the learned Sessions Court Judge in
passing the sentence was as follows:
Jelas kepada Mahkamah bahawa berdasarkan kepada keterangan mangsa
sendiri sewaktu pemeriksaan balas bahawa mangsa ingin dan telah
menarik semula laporan polisnya terhadap OKT. Pegawai Penyiasat kes
telah merakam percakapan menarik balik beliau walaupun laporan itu tidak
dikemukakan ke Mahkamah. Keterangan mangsa ini meletakkan
Mahkamah dalam dilemma – machinery of justice telah berputar tetapi
dan akan terus berputar sehingga satu penghakiman diputuskan oleh saya.
Apabila OKT mengaku salah maka dynamics kes tersebut juga berubah
dan tidak boleh disamakan dengan kes bicara penuh. Berdasarkan fakta
yang amat unik ini maka saya berpuas hati bahawa satu hukuman yang
sesuai adalah bond berkelakuan baik untuk tempoh selama 5 tahun
dengan jaminan sedia ada.

[11]
H

Section 294(1) of the CPC provides as follows:

First offenders
294(1) When any person has been convicted of any offence before any
Court if it appears to the Court that regard being had to the character,
antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the offender or to the
trivial nature of the offence or to any extenuating circumstances under

I



272

Current Law Journal

[2018] 9 CLJ

which the offence was committed it is expedient that the offender be
released on probation of good conduct, the Court may, instead of
sentencing him at once to any punishment, direct that he be released on
his entering into a bond with or without sureties and during such period
as the Court may direct to appear and receive judgment if and when called
upon and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.

[12] The factors to be considered or rather that could trigger the invocation
of sub-s. 294(1) namely, character, antecedents, age, health or mental
condition of the offender or to the trivial nature of the offence or to any
extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed and
nothing else as in Public Prosecutor v. Chew Jim [1950] 1 LNS 48; [1950] 1
MLJ 203 Thomson J (as he then was) said:
As regards section 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that section
provides that binding over may be substituted for imprisonment if it
appears to the court that such substitution is “expedient” regard being had
to the character, the antecedents, the age, the health or mental condition
of the offender or to the trivial nature of the offence or to any
extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed. As I
had occasion to observe in Criminal Appeal No: 38 of 1949, (See (1949)
MLJ 231) “each individual case must be considered on its merits and must
be examined with a view to ascertaining whether having regard to any of the matters
mentioned in section 294 binding over is in all the circumstances of the case
expedient”. (emphasis added)

[13] An application to withdraw a complaint or police report by a
complainant against an accused person to the Attorney General is not
uncommon in criminal cases. To my mind, legally a police report cannot be
withdrawn or revoked but a complainant may appeal to the Attorney
General not to proceed with the prosecution of the accused person and it is
solely the prerogative of the Attorney General to institute or decline a
prosecution under art. 145(3) of the Federal Constitution. This is because
once a person decides to lodge a police report against another for a wrong
committed by the latter the matter is no longer under the formers control.
It is no longer his or her case but a case by the State under the control of
the Attorney General. A prosecution will ensue if there is sufficient evidence
to prove the offence alleged. However, a private prosecution may be taken
up by an individual if the Attorney General declines to prosecute in cases
involving non-seizable offences. It is for this reason to my mind the fact that
the complainant wishes not to pursue is not a factor to be considered for the
application of sub-s. 294(1) of the CPC.

[14] Having read the said provision and the factors provided therein or
rather the prerequisites to be satisfied before the court can invoke
sub-s. 294(1), I am satisfied that the learned Sessions Court Judge had
wrongly exercised his discretion in opting for sub-s. 294(1) of the CPC.
Obviously the fact that the complainant wishes not to pursue cannot be a
factor to be considered. Hence, the revision.
[15] On 29 March 2018 all parties were present including the accused
person. Learned counsel for the accused raised a preliminary objection ie,
whether a revision was appropriate when the notice of appeal has been filed.
Apparently the prosecution has filed the notice of appeal on 15 March 2018.

C

D

E

F

The Preliminary Objection
[16] Learned counsel for the accused submitted that by applying for
revision after filing the notice of appeal, the prosecution was abusing the
process of the court. According to learned counsel, the prosecution must
choose whether to proceed with the revision or appeal and they have to
withdraw the notice of appeal if they wished to proceed with the appeal. He
further argued that a revision cannot be used as a backdoor and would make
an appeal redundant. He relied on the case of Basheer Ahmad Maula Sahul
Hameed & Anor v. PP [2016] 6 CLJ 422; [2016] 9 MLJ 549; Mok Swee Kok
v. Public Prosecutor [1994] 3 SLR 140; and Ang Poh Chuan v. Public Prosecutor
[1996] SLR 326.
[17] In response, the learned DPP undertook to withdraw the notice of
appeal and maintain the application for revision. He cited public outcry
hence the need to hear this matter urgently. He referred to Rosli bin Supardi
v. PP [2002] 3 CLJ 544 where the Court of Appeal revised and enhanced the
sentence although there was no appeal by the prosecution.

H

[18] The cases referred to by the learned counsel for the accused person
dealt with the issue where once the accused person had pleaded guilty he
could only appeal against the sentence imposed – Basheer Ahmad Maula Sahul
Hameed (supra). However, the appellate court in hearing the appeal could be
invited to look at the propriety of the proceedings, for example, the facts
tendered in the court below did not satisfy the elements of the offence
charged – Mok Siew Kok (supra); no notice of appeal was filed by the accused
person against the forfeiture order but a petition for revision was filed by an
interested party – Ang Poh Chuan (supra).

I

[19] I could not find any judicial pronouncement in these cases that once
a notice of appeal is filed, an application for a revision cannot be done. Even
in Mohd Dalhar Redzwan & Anor v. Datuk Bandar, Dewan Bandaraya Kuala
Lumpur [1995] 2 CLJ 209; [1995] 1 MLJ 645 at p. 219 (CLJ); p. 655 (MLJ)
Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) said:

G



274

Current Law Journal

[2018] 9 CLJ

The second principle of settled law is that, save in exceptional cases and
for very good reasons, there can be no resort had by a party to the
revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court when the decision complained
of is appealable and no appeal has been lodged.

[20] However, I agreed that the prosecution must choose to proceed with
the appeal or revision if both matters are before the court. Here, the
prosecution chose to proceed with the application for revision. I, therefore
dismissed the preliminary objection.

A

B

The Revision
[21] The learned DPP submitted that the sentence of binding over under
sub-s. 294(1) of the CPC is illegal and manifestly and grossly inadequate.

C

Application Of Sub-section 294(6)
[22] On illegality, the learned DPP contended that as s. 294 was amended
with the insertion of sub-s. 294(6) which came into force on 1 March 2017,
an offence under s. 326 of the PC being a serious offence is excluded from
the application of sub-s. 294(1). He submitted that the amendment being
procedural, it has retrospective application. In support he cited the case of
Dalip Baghwan Singh v. Public Prosecutor [1997] 4 CLJ 645.
[23] The amendment, vide Act A1521, came into force on 1 March 2017.
As this involves criminal law and punishment, I was of the view that the
amendment does not apply to any serious offence committed prior to said
date. To argue otherwise would, to my mind, offends art. 7(1) of the Federal
Constitution. The offence was committed on 21 December 2016 and if the
charge is proven against her she may suffer the punishment provided under
the said provision but at the same time it would be open to the trial court
to opt for sub-s. 294(1) of the CPC.
[24]

Article 7 of the Federal Constitution provides as follows:

7. Protection against retrospective criminal laws and repeated trials
(1) No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not
punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer
greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time
it was committed.

G

(2) … . (emphasis added) 11

[25] Prior to 1 March 2017 any accused person irrespective of being
convicted of any offence punishable with any punishment would be entitled
as of right to be considered to be released on a bond of good behaviour. The
insertion of sub-s. 294(6) of the CPC has taken this right away or deprived
the accused person of her right to be considered to be released on a bond of
good behaviour.

[26] In PP v. Hun Peng Khai & Ors & Other Cases [1984] 2 CLJ 290; [1984]
2 CLJ (Rep) 391;[1984] 2 MLJ 318, the accused persons were charged with
trafficking in drugs under s. 39B(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act and the trial
had commenced with one witness being called before the Sessions Court. At
the material time the punishment for trafficking in drugs was either death or
life imprisonment. As the accused persons were charged in the Sessions
Court, upon conviction they would only suffer life imprisonment. However,
the learned President of the Sessions Court who felt bound by the decision
of the High Court in Kuantan transferred the case to the High Court as he
felt he that had no longer the jurisdiction to try the case owing to the
amendment making death penalty a mandatory sentence.
[27] On revision Edgar Joseph Jr J (as he then was) ordered that the trial
to continue in the Sessions Court as the accused persons had a vested interest
that the sentence that could be imposed upon them was life imprisonment.
If the transfer was allowed the appellant would face only one penalty ie,
death. This would infringe art. 7(1) of the Federal Constitution. At p. 326
the learned judge held as follows:
This brings me to the case of Public Prosecutor v. Mohamed Ismail [1984] 1
MLJ 134, a prosecution for trafficking in a dangerous drug in
contravention of section 39B(1) of the Principal Act, in which I had to
consider the question of law, “what is the material date for determining
sentence for offences under section 39B(1), is it the date of offence or
date of conviction?” and I concluded, on the authority of the Privy
Council case of Baker & Anor v. The Queen [1975] 3 All ER 55 57 - 58, that
it is the date of conviction. The effect of this was that prima facie, there
being no saving clause in the Amending Act to the effect that this
amendment shall not apply to offences committed prior to the date of its
coming into force, I held that section 39B(2) is retrospective.
However, so far as such offences were concerned, I was of opinion,
fortified by another passage in the judgment of Lord Diplock in Baker’s
case, at p.61 b to f, that it violates Article 7(1) of our Constitution as it
subjected such accused persons to greater punishment than was prescribed
by law at the time the offence was committed.

[28] The Supreme Court affirmed this decision as reflected in the Editorial
Note. Further in Public Prosecutor v. Cheah Cheng Eng [1986] 1 CLJ 303;
[1986] CLJ (Rep) 212; [1986] 2 MLJ 39 again the Federal Court held that
at pp. 40-41:
Cases pending trial prior to the coming into force of the amending Act
may still be heard by the Sessions Court unless of course the Public
Prosecutor should choose to invoke section 41A of the Act which
empowers the Public Prosecutor to require any case in respect of an
offence under the Act to be tried by the High Court.

[2018] 9 CLJ

[29] Act A1521 makes no provision making the amendment retrospective.
Therefore, it is my considered opinion that sub-s. 294(6) of the CPC is only
applicable to serious offences committed after 1 March 2017. Notwithstanding
the amendment was made to a code of procedure, it touches the substantive
right of an accused person. In Hun Peng Khai (supra) at p. 320 the learned
judge said:
It is true that it is not unknown for Parliament to legislate with
retrospective effect so that the law of tomorrow becomes the law of
yesterday. It is equally true that no one has a vested right in procedure.
(Public Prosecutor v. Dato Harun Idris [1977] 1 MLJ 14). However, this rule
of construction is subject to the important qualification that where rights
are vested in or accrued to a party they are not affected by a repeal or
amendment to statute even if it relates to procedure.

Sentence
[30] With respect to the sentence being manifestly and grossly inadequate
the learned DPP submitted that the learned Sessions Court Judge in meting
out the sentence failed to consider the followings:

D

(i) the injuries sustained by the complainant were serious and can lead to
death and referred to the case of Rosli bin Supardi v. PP (supra);
(ii) the element of public interest which demands the imposition of a heavy
sentence and referred to the cases of PP v. Loo Choon Fatt [1976] 1 LNS
102; [1976] 2 MLJ 256 and R v. Kenneth John Ball 35 Cr. App. R 164;

E

(iii) the gravity of the offence and referred to the case of PP v. Abd Halim Abd
Samat [2014] 4 CLJ 12; [2014] 6 MLJ 144;
(iv) the offence committed was prevalent and rampant and referred to the
cases of PP v. Leonard Glenn Francis [1989] 1 CLJ 972; [1989] 2 CLJ
(Rep) 320 and PP v. Sathiaseelan a/l Periyasamy & Anor [2010] 2 CLJ 890;
[2010] 8 MLJ 710.
[31] It was further submitted that the learned Sessions Court Judge had
over emphasised on the followings:
(i) the plea of guilt and referred to the cases of Pendakwa Raya v. Sangkar
Ratnam [2007] 1 LNS 233; [2007] 7 MLJ 353; PP lwn. Dato’
Nallakaruppan Solaimalai [1999] 2 CLJ 596; and PP v. Oo Leng Swee & Ors

PP v. Rozita Mohamad Ali

277

[32] The learned DPP pressed for a deterrent sentence and referred to the
cases of Abd Halim Abd Samat (supra) where the Court of Appeal substituted
an order of binding over with a sentence of ten years imprisonment. And in
Rosli bin Supardi (supra) where the Court of Appeal substituted a sentence of
six years imprisonment and three strokes with twelve years imprisonment
and five strokes.
[33] Learned counsel for the accused in response, urged this court to
maintain the order of binding over and submitted as follows:

C

(i) the accused had pleaded guilty and the learned Sessions Court Judge had
in fact determined the sentence of nine years imprisonment if the bond
is breached;

D

(ii) sentencing being a matter of discretion the appellate court should be
slow in interfering with the sentence imposed by the lower court.
Reference was made to PP v. Muhamad Arif Sabri & Ors [2014] 1 LNS
604; [2014] 6 MLJ 282;

E

(iii) public interest would be best served if the accused person was induced
to turn from criminal ways to honest living and he referred to the case
of Lim Yoon Fah v. Public Prosecutor [1970] 1 LNS 66; [1971] 1 MLJ 37
where the court substituted a sentence of thirty months imprisonment
and four strokes with a bond under s. 294 for an armed robbery;
(iv) the complainant had wanted to withdraw her police report against the
accused person and this constituted an extenuating circumstances as
provided in sub-s. 294(1) of the CPC;

F

G

(v) the accused person, aged 44 and a housewife, was not in the category of
a criminal;
(vi) the accused person was a first offender and pleaded guilty on the day
when the charge was amended and he referred to the case of Public
Prosecutor v. Yeong Yin Choy [1976] 1 LNS 119; [1976] 2 MLJ 267 where
the court affirmed the bond under s. 294 for an offence under s. 324 of
the PC; and
(vii) the court ought not to be influenced by the public who displayed their
displeasure over the sentence imposed.

H

I

Decision
[34] The accused person pleaded guilty after ten witnesses took the stand.
The original charge proffered against her was one under s. 307 of the PC
which carries a maximum term of 20 years imprisonment. The charge was
amended to s. 326 of the PC which provides for a similar term of maximum
imprisonment and liable to a fine or to whipping. Being a female she cannot



278

Current Law Journal

[2018] 9 CLJ

be whipped. Hence, there is practically no difference in term of the sentence
that could be imposed but she chose to claim trial under the earlier charge.
Although she pleaded guilty when the charge was amended I do not think this
can be strong mitigating factor. In Dato’ Nallakaruppan Solaimalai (supra) at p.
600 Arifin Jaka J had this to say:

A

Di dalam kes sekarang OKT telah mengaku salah hanya selepas
perbicaraan dijalankan selama dua belas (12) hari dan apabila pertuduhan
dipinda. Dari fakta kes ini adalah nyata OKT menukar pendiriannya dan
memilih untuk memberi kerjasama dengan pihak polis selepas banyak
masa terbuang dan kesusahan kepada saksi yang telah memberi
keterangan. Jika kerjasama ini diberikan sebelum OKT dihadapkan ke
mahkamah atas pertuduhan yang asal saya percaya pihak Pendakwa Raya
mungkin menggunakan budibicaranya untuk mengenakan tuduhan di
bawah Akta Senjata Api 1960 terhadap OKT dan tidak menunggu selepas
12 hari perbicaraan dijalankan. Pengakuan salah yang dibuat oleh OKT di
dalam keadaan kes ini tidaklah boleh diterima sebagai satu fakta yang
boleh meringankan hukuman.

B

C

D

This statement was approved by the Court of Appeal in Bachik Abdul Rahman
v. PP [2004] 2 CLJ 572; [2004] 2 MLJ 534 and Pendakwa Raya v. Mohamed
Danny Mohamed Jedi [2018] 5 CLJ 692; [2018] MLJU 53.
[35] I had read the notes of evidence and I do not see any strong defence
as far as the assault was concerned. Mohamed Dzaiddin J (as he then was)
in PP v. Low Kok Wai [1988] 2 CLJ 105; [1988] 2 CLJ (Rep) 268 at p. 269
had this to say,
It is a principle of sentencing that whenever possible the Court should
take into account as a mitigating factor the fact that the accused has
pleaded guilty. The extent to which a plea of guilty is a mitigating factor
must depend on the facts of each case, and it cannot be a powerful
mitigating factor when effectively no defence to the charge was available
to the accused.

[36] The fact that the complainant withdrew her police report and did not
wish to pursue, to my mind, does not attract the invocation of sub-s. 294(1)
of the CPC. The learned counsel for the accused contended that it fell within
the phrase ‘to any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was
committed’. I do not agree. In PP v. Fam Kim Hock [1956] 1 LNS 83; [1957]
MLJ 20 Buhagiar J did not disturb the sentence of binding over and held as
follows:
The offence is by no means of a trivial nature but the points mentioned
in the above section are intended by the legislature to indicate the lines
on which the discretion of the Court should be exercised. In applying the
provisions of section 294 in the present case the learned President took
into consideration the fact that the respondent was a first offender, the

circumstances under which the offence was committed and that it was quite
clear that the parties themselves would welcome a settlement. The last mentioned point
would not in most cases be any reason why a convicted person should not suffer the
punishment provided by law but in the particular circumstances of this case where
the manager’s son (who was the person with whom the respondent had to deal mostly
and who for all practical purposes was the manager in Port Swettenham) had almost
instructed him to commit irregularities is very relevant in considering whether this was
a proper case for the application of section 294. (emphasis added)

[37] So clearly it refers to the time when the offence was committed.
Therefore, I do not think it can be extended to event or development that
took place subsequent to the commission.
C

[38] Learned counsel for the accused urged upon me not take into account
the public outcry, with respect, I disagree. Suffice for me to refer to the case
of Abd Halim Abd Samat (supra) the Court of Appeal speaking through Raus
Sharif PCA (as he then was) said:
D

E

F

G

Learned counsel for the accused had urged this court to maintain the
binding over order imposed by the courts below. With respect, if we were
to accede to his request, the public will think that the court is putting
the interest of criminals above the interest of the public. That cannot be
right. As stated earlier this type of criminal conduct must be dealt with
severely by the courts if it is to serve as a warning to other would be
offenders. In our judgment, the element of public interest may be best
served through the imposition of a custodial sentence given the gravity
and other factors surrounding the wrongful act complained of. Surely,
causing grievous hurt to a defenceless fellow human being, as in this case,
attracts severe punishment under the law. (emphasis added)

[39] No doubt she was a first offender but the gravity and the seriousness
of the offence committed would outweigh that mitigating factor as pointed
out in Abd Halim Abd Samat (supra) which coincidently dealt with a similar
offence. And further the emotional distress which resulted in poor health
causing a surgery to be performed and to be followed by physiotherapy is not
something that has been in existence before the offence was committed but
as a result of the four day remand after she was arrested.
[40] Being 44 years of age she was not young nor old. In Re Badri Abas
[1970] 1 LNS 133; [1971] 1 MLJ 202 at p. 203 Sharma J held:

H

I

I am of the view that action cannot be taken under section 173A on the
ground of the age of the offender alone unless there is placed on the
record material to show that by reason of the character, antecedents and
the circumstances under which the accused committed the offence, it was
expedient to act under that section. There is no such record in this
particular case and the age of the accused is also not one where the court



280

Current Law Journal

[2018] 9 CLJ

could be favourably inclined to exercise its discretion either under section
173A or section 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code, as he is 36 years
of age.

To my mind, this view is still good notwithstanding the Act A1274 which
came into force on 6 March 2007 making this provision applicable to all
offenders instead of adult offenders only.

A

B

[41] In Public Prosecutor v. Tan Eng Hock [1969] 1 LNS 140; [1970] 2 MLJ
15 Abdul Aziz J said:
In fixing sentence, the nature and the circumstances and the degree of
deliberation must be taken into account.

C

From the evidence adduced there was no provocation coming from the
complainant and clearly the accused persons act was deliberate and not
impulsive.
[42] The learned DPP contended that maid abuse was rampant and
prevalent and I have no reason to disagree as I can take judicial notice of this
fact. Cases of this nature often being widely reported. This factor would
justify deterrent sentence to be meted out. In Sinnathurai Subramaniam v. PP
[2011] 5 CLJ 56 the Court of Appeal at p. 64 speaking through Ahmad
Maarop JCA (as he then was) stated as follows:
The learned judge also took into account the prevalence of offences of
homicide which he observed was given wide media coverage. Again I do
not think he had fallen into error. He was entitled to take judicial notice
of the prevalence of such offences.

[43] Keeping in the forefront of my mind all the authorities aforesaid, I
shall now examine some cases of similar offence with regard to sentencing:
(i)

(ii)

Rosli bin Supardi (supra) the Court of Appeal substituted the sentence
of six years imprisonment and three strokes with 12 years
imprisonment and five strokes. The appellant claimed trial and
convicted. He was a first offender. The victim’s throat was cut several
times.
Annantan Subramaniam v. PP [2007] 8 CLJ 1 the High Court
maintained the sentence of eight years and eight strokes. The appellant
aged 20, pleaded guilty and a first offender. The weapon used was a
Rambo knife. The victim was stabbed in her abdomen and her throat
was cut after the appellant raped her. All in all the appellant suffered
20 years imprisonment as the sentence for s. 326 was made to run
concurrently with the 20 years imprisonment for rape.

various internal injuries and was in coma for 12 days.

Chew Eng Aik v. Pendakwa Raya [2014] 1 LNS 1303 the High Court

Abd Halim Abd Samat (supra) the Court of Appeal substituted a binding

parang. The injuries sustained were multiple lacerations on the victims

(xiii) Budiman Che Mamat v. PP [2017] 1 LNS 1936 the High Court affirmed
the eight years imprisonment and one stroke. The appellant aged 30,
pleaded guilty and a first offender. The weapon used was “besi kuku
kambing”. The victims both arms were fractured and his ear was
almost ripped off.
[44] The sentences meted out differed from one case to another depending
on various factors discussed in the judgments. But they were all for deterrent
sentence in view of the seriousness of the offence with the element of public
interest being the foremost consideration. Factors like first offender and
pleading guilty apparently did not really find favour with the courts in cases
of this nature.
[45] The complainant came all the way from Medan, Indonesia seeking for
a job to earn an honest living. She commenced her employment on
8 December 2016 as a maid or servant to the accused but certainly not as
a slave. According to her, she was asked to look after the 17 cats and take
care of the house. Roughly about a week later the accused started to abuse
her and that happened everyday thereafter.
[46] She told the court below that she was kicked, assaulted with a cloths
hanger, book, an umbrella, a steel mop rod and a kitchen knife. According
to her the accused hit her head with the umbrella and the steel mop rod and
she identified the bent steel mop rod as the instrument that was used by the
accused person to hit her head.

[47] She bolted on 21 December 2016 and was found by the drain in a state
of semi-consciousness within the same housing area by a security guard. She
was then taken to a private clinic by one of the neighbours. According to the
private practitioner (SP2) she was bleeding on the side of her neck and at the
back of her head. Her eyes were completely swollen and closed and bruises
on her body.
[48] The police was summoned and took her to University of Malaya
Medical Centre. According to the doctor who saw her (SP5) her face was
swollen and her entire body was quite swollen too. She could hardly open
her eyes due to swelling and bruises were detected. They were as follows:

C

(i) multiple bruises of varying ages over her shoulder, chest wall, upper
limbs, lower limbs and back;
(ii) multiple abrasions on her right lower chest and over the scalp;

D

swelling of the entire neck, bilateral upper limbs and hands and ear.

injuries.

[49] The complainant was then examined by SP6 the Consultant Neuro
Surgeon who testified that the Ct scan of the head revealed a punctuate
haemorrhage in the front part of the brain which was most often caused by
external blow or a hard knock and fractures involving the facial bone
primarily the maxillary and zygomatic bone. These injuries corresponded
with the evidence of the complainant based on her description of the
incident. She said:

[50] CT scan of the lungs revealed lung contusion due to blunt trauma. SP6
testified further that based on the clinical and CT scan findings he decided
that it was a mild head injury and placed the complainant on observation for
48 hours particularly because of the punctuate haemorrhage fearing that the
bleed could expand.

A

[51] Under cross-examination he confirmed that there was no bleeding
expansion and she was stable after 48 hours. As for the facial fractures, SP6
said the surgeon had decided on conservative management and the
orthopedic decided that there was no further management because she did not
have significant fractures. She was discharged on 25 January 2017 ie, about
four days later.

[52] For an offence of causing grievous hurt, to my mind, the injuries
inflicted are the utmost important factor that would guide the court in
assessing the sentence. In this case out of the eight kinds of hurt designated
as grievous enumerated under s. 320 of the Penal Code the hurt sustained by
the complainant falls under para. (g) – ‘fracture or dislocation of a bone.
Based on SP6’s evidence, there was no necessity to intervene surgically as
far as the fractures were concerned. In other words, the fractures were
minimal and would heal by itself.
[53] Be that as it may, a fracture caused by an instrument which, used as
a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death ie, the steel mop rod has satisfied
the elements of s. 326. The complainant was defenceless and traumatic while
under employment of the accused person. Having considered all the
surrounding factors, the order of binding over is set aside and is substituted
with a sentence of eight years imprisonment with effect from 29 March
2018.

Stay Of Execution
[54] The learned counsel for the accused sought to stay the execution of the
sentence pending appeal. He argued that there was a point of law involved
to justify the stay namely, whether the wishes of the complainant not to
pursue can be an extenuating circumstance under which the offence was
committed – one of the prerequisites under sub-s. 294(1) of the CPC. In Dato’
Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP and Another Application [2004] 1 CLJ 592 Pajan
Singh Gill FCJ at p.606 had this to say:
Incidentally, difficult point of law has not been considered as sufficient
to ‘demonstrate special or exceptional circumstances of the kind which
would lead to a grant of bail’. (See: Hanson v. Director of Public Prosecutor
(supra).
