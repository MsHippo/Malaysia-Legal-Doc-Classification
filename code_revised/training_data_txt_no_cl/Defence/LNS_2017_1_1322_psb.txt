(At the end of the Defence’s case)
INTRODUCTION
[1]

The Accused was charged at the instance of the Public
Prosecutor for the following offence which reads as follows:
“Bahawa kamu pada 28 Mac 2015, jam lebih kurang 09.00
pagi, di rumah tidak bernombor di Foo Shan Sawmill,
dalam Daerah Bintulu, dalam Negeri Sarawak, telah
membunuh ERWING (L) (PASSPORT: A0092791) dan
dengan itu kamu telah melakukan suatu kesalahan yang
boleh dihukum di bawah Seksyen 302 Kanun Keseksaan.”

THE ACCUSED’S CONTENTIONS AT THE END OF THE
PROSECUTION’S CASE
[2]

The Defence’s sole contention was that the Prosecution has
failed to establish a prima facie case as most of the evidence is
inadmissible and the evidence adduced is insufficient to link the
Accused in any material manner to establish the elements of the
offence and charge.

[3]

The Defence further contended that the Prosecution called a
total of 22 witnesses, all of whom used witness statements for
their examinations-in-chief and that the following witnesses
affirmed their oaths in Bahasa Malaysia namely:(a)

PW1 L/Kpl Mohd Rohaizad.

Before they began giving their examinations-in-chief for each of
them it was stated as follows:- “AFFIRMS AND STATES IN
BAHASA MALAYSIA”:

[5]

The following witnesses affirmed their oaths in Mandarin
namely:(a)

PW18 Lim Seng Kwe.

[6]

Only PW10 (Phoon–the Chemist) and PW17 (Dr. Norliza–the
Pathologist) affirmed their oaths in English.

[7]

In the light of the above, the Defence contended that if the oaths
were affirmed in Bahasa Malaysia then either the witness
statements must be in Bahasa Malaysia or the witness statements
must be interpreted to the respective witnesses from English to
Bahasa Malaysia before they were tendered in Court. The same
principle applies to those witnesses who gave their oaths in
Mandarin.

[8]

The Defence contended that a perusal of the Notes of
Proceedings showed that the witness statements that are all in
the English Language were not interpreted to the respective
witnesses with the exception of PW18 (Lim Seng Kwe) who
affirmed the oath in Mandarin and only stated in crossexamination at page 111, line 3561 the NOP that his witness
statement was interpreted to him in Mandarin, but he did not
state whether it was interpreted to him in court just before the
tendering of the witness statement and after the oath was
affirmed or that the witness statement was interpreted to him
outside court well before he gave evidence.

[9]

The Defence also contended that the fact that the witness
statements for each witness that did not affirm their oaths in
English and/or give evidence in English must have the witness
statements in English interpreted to them by the court interpreter
before the preliminary questions regarding the witness
statements are asked and the tendering of the witness statement
as an exhibit, is demonstrated by the fact and the manner in
which the witness statement of PW 5 was tendered in court as

6



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

can be seen at Page 20, lines 504 to 508 of the NOP where the
following preliminary statements were made:
(“DPP: Since it is English, can we translate the witness
statement into Bahasa Malaysia,)
(Court Interpreter, Puan Lily translates the witness statement to
the witness into Bahasa Malaysia.)”
The above is the manner in which all the witness statements
should have been interpreted and tendered.
[10] The Defence thus contended that with the exception of PW5,
PW10 and PW17 the rest of the witnesses’ oral evidence and
exhibits marked through them is inadmissible and so is their
subsequent cross-examination and re-examination because they
all originated from a defective source which was the failure to
interpret their respective witness statements from English to
Bahasa Malaysia or Mandarin, whichever is applicable for noncompliance with section 402B of the Criminal Procedure Code
(CPC). (see Abuchi Ngwoke v. PP [2016] 2 MLJ 623)
[11] The Defence also contended that even though they did not object
to the tendering of the witness statements, however inadmissible
evidence does not become admissible by the failure to object.
(see Alcontara A/L AMBROSS ANTHONY v. PP [1996] 1 MLJ
209)
THE
PROSECUTION’S
CONTENTIONS
ON
ADMISSIBILITY OF THEIR 22 WITNESS STATEMENTS

THE

[12] The Prosecution contended that the learned defence counsel in
this case had agreed to the tendering of the witness statements
and the defence counsel also was the person who suggested that

7



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

all the witnesses to give evidence through witness statement
even though there were mutual agreement between both parties
that the witnesses statements were only to be tendered through
formal witnesses i.e. the chemist, the photographer, the
Investigation Officer and other police personnel.
[13] The Prosecution also highlighted that all the prosecution witnesses
had been crossed examined and re-examined whereby 90% of the
questions asked by the defence counsel were based on the witness
statements themselves and yet all the witnesses were still managed
to answer the questions without having any problem understanding
the questions asked. This showed that all the witnesses understood
the contents of their respective witness statements otherwise they
would not know how to answer questions posed to them during
cross examination and re-examination.
[14] Further the Prosecution stated that the witness statements were
prepared in the presence of the witnesses who sat down with
them and whatever uttered by them during the recording were
read, translated and explained to them to ascertain the truth of
the contents of their respective witness statements.
COURT’S FINDING ON
WITNESS STATEMENTS

THE

ADMISSIBILITY

OF

THE

[15] This Court finds that the witness statements adduced in court are
admissible as the witness statements had been certified by each
and every of the witnesses that they are their witness statement.
Further they confirmed that they understood the contents of their
respective witness statements and confirmed that the contents
stated in their respective witness statement are the truth to the
best of their knowledge and belief. All the witnesses identified
their respective witness statements in open court and signed
8



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

their respective witness statements after they confirmed the
authenticity of their respective witness statements. All the
witness statements had been tendered and marked without any
objections by the Defence. Apart from that, all the respective
witness statements bore the declaration at the bottom of last
page of each witness statements containing the following words
“THE ABOVE STATEMENT WAS READ BACK TO ME AND
AFFIRMED TO BE TRUE BASED ON THE BEST OF MY
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF AND SIGNED BY ME”.
[16] It is noted that the only thing that was not done was that the
witness statements were not read aloud in open court. However,
in this case, the Court finds that the court interpreter had
translated and explained the respective witness statements to the
witnesses in open court. In the circumstance of this case and
absence of any objection from the Defence’s counsel, this Court
finds that there is no necessity to read aloud the witness
statement in open court because it would defeat the purpose of
the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code as regards to
Section 402B itself because it is the objective of the Parliament
in introducing this section that is to speed up the trial held in
court.
[17] As regards the case of Abuchi Ngwoke v. PP [2016] 2 MLJ 623
which was relied upon by the Defence, this Court finds that the
above case can be distinguished as in that case, the Court of
Appeal held inter alia as follows:
“.... there was no indication that SP1 had read out the
witness statement. ... It was further found that the witness
statement of SP1 did not bear his signature and neither did
the witness statement contain a declaration required under
para (2) (b) of S. 402B of the CPC. Hence, the

9



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

preconditions set out in para (2) for the admissibility of
the evidence had not been complied with, rendering the
witness statement of SP1 inadmissible (emphasis added)”
[18] The above citied case above can be distinguished with the
present case as in that case, the witness statement did not bear
the signature of the maker and nor it contained a declaration as
required by para (2) (b) of s. 402B of the Criminal Procedure
Code. In the present case, all the respective witness statements
were duly signed and contained the requisite declarations as
required under S. 402B of the Criminal Procedure Code.
[19] This Court finds that since all the relevant witnesses understood the
contents of their respective witness statements which were duly
signed by them, which contained the requisite declarations and
which admission was not objected to, by the Defence and since
there is no injustice caused to the Defence, this Court finds that the
witness statements had fulfilled the pre-requisites of section 402B
of the Criminal Procedure Code and are thus admissible.
DUTY OF THE COURT AT THE END OF PROSECUTION’S
CASE
[20] At the end of the prosecution case and having outlined the
evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution above, it is
pertinent for this court to remind itself as to its duty at this stage
of the case. The statutory duty upon a trial court at the end of
the case for the prosecution is as laid in section 180 and section
173(f) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Both sections are set out
in similar terms. It states that when the case for the prosecution
is concluded, the Court shall consider whether the prosecution
has made out a prima facie case against the accused. Sub section
4 of section 180 states, “For the purpose of this section, a prima
facie case is made out against the accused where the

10



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

prosecution has adduced credible evidence proving each
ingredient of the offence which if unrebutted or unexplained
would warrant a conviction”.
PRIMA FACIE CASE AND THE MAXIMUM EVALUATION
TEST
[21] In the case of PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No.3) [1999]
2 CLJ 215; [1999] 2 MLJ 1, it was held as follows:
“The meaning of prima facie case in s. 180(1) of the
Criminal Procedure Code must be understood in the
context of a non jury trial. A prima facie case arises when
the evidence in favour of a party is sufficiently strong for
the opposing party to be called on to answer. The evidence
adduced must be such that it can be overthrown only by
rebutting evidence by the other side. Taken in its totality,
the force of the evidence must be such that, if unrebutted,
it is sufficient to induce the court to believe in the
existence of the facts stated in the charge or to consider its
existence so probable that a prudent man ought to act
upon the supposition that those facts existed or did
happen. As this exercise cannot be postponed to the end of
the trial a maximum evaluation of the credibility of the
witnesses must be done at the close of the case for the
prosecution before the court can rule that a prima facie
case has been made out in order to call for defence. Be
that as it may, I am unable to agree with the defence
submission that this means that the prosecution must prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt at that stage. A case is
said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt only
upon a consideration and assessment of all the evidence

11



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

(see Canadian Criminal Evidence (3 rd Ed).....thus, a prima
facie case as prescribed by the new s. 180(1) of the
Criminal Procedure Code must mean a case which if
unrebutted would warrant a conviction.”
[22] Vincent Ng J (as he then was) in Public Prosecutor v. Ong
Cheng Heong [1998] 4 CLJ 209; [1998] 6 MLJ 678, stated what
amounts to credible evidence in order to make out a prima facie
case, held as follows:
“What then constitutes a ‘prima facie case’? prima facie
means on the face of it or at first glance. Tome, in the light
of Act A979, perhaps the most appropriate definition of a
‘prima facie case’ could be found in the Oxford
Companion of Law (pg 987) which has it as:
“A case which is sufficient to call for an answer.
While prima facie evidence which is sufficient to
establish a fact in the absence of any evidence to the
contrary, but is not conclusive. “It would follow that
there should be credible evidence on each and every
essential ingredient of the offence. Credible evidence
is evidence which has been filtered and which has
gone through the process of evaluation. Any evidence
which is not safe to be acted upon should be
rejected.”
[23] In Looi Kow Chai v. Public Prosecutor [2003] 1 CLJ 734;
[2003] 2 AMR 89, Gopal Sri Ram JCA(as he then was) held as
follows:
“In our respectful view the correct test to be applied in
determining whether a prima facie case has been made out
under section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code (and

12



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

this would apply to a trial under s. 173 of the Code) is that
as encapsulated in the judgment of Hashim Yeop Sani FJ
(as he then was) in Dato’ Mokhtar bin Hashim & Anor v.
PP [1983] CLJ Rep 721; [1983] 2 MLJ 232 at 270:
To summarise, it would therefore appear that having
regard to the prosecution evidence adduced so far, a prima
facie case has not been established against Nordin Johan
and Abdul Aziz Abdullah, the second accused and the
fourth accused which, failing their rebuttal, would warrant
their conviction. In other words if they elect to remain
silent now (which I hold they are perfectly entitled to do so
even though they are being tried under Emergency
Regulations) the question is can they be convicted of the
offence of s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Penal Code? My
answer to the question is in the negative.
We are confident in the view we have just expressed
because we find nothing in the amended s. 180 of the
Criminal Procedure Code that has taken away the right of
an accused person to remain silent at the close of the
prosecution case. Further we find nothing in the
legislative intention of Parliament as expressed in the
language employed by it to show that there would be a
dual exercise by a judge under s. 180 when an accused
elects to remain silent as happened in Pavone v. PP
[1983] CLJ Rep 855; [1983] 2 CLJ 225; [1984] 1 MLJ 77.
In other words we are unable to discover anything in the
language of the recently formulated s. 180 that requires a
judge sitting alone first to make a minimum evaluation and
the when the accused elects to remain silent to make a
maximum evaluation in deciding whether to convict or not
at the close of the prosecution case.
13



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

It therefore follows that there is only one exercise that that
a judge sitting alone under s. of the Code180 has to
undertake at the close of the prosecution case. He must
subject the prosecution evidence to maximum evaluation
and to ask himself the question:
If I decide to call upon the accused to enter his defence
and he remains silent, am I prepared to convict him on the
totality of the evidence contained in the prosecution case?
If the answer is in the negative then no prima facie case
has been made out and the accused would be entitled to an
acquittal.”
[24] In Balachandran v. Public Prosecutor [2005] 1 CLJ 85
Augustine Paul JCA (as he then was) held:
“A prima facie case is therefore one that is sufficient for
the accused to be called upon to answer. This in turn
means that the evidence adduced must be such that it can
be overthrown only by evidence in rebuttal. The phrase
“prima facie case” is defined in similar terms in Mozley
and Whiteley’s Law Dictionary, 1 th Edn as:
A litigating party is said to have a prima facie case
when the evidence in his favour is sufficiently strong
for his opponent to be called to answer it. A prima
facie case then, is one which is established by
sufficient evidence, and can be overthrown only by
rebutting evidence adduced by the other side.
The result is that the force of the evidence adduced must
be such that, if unrebutted, it is sufficient to induce the
court to believe in the existence of the facts stated in the
charge or to consider its existence so probable that a

14



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

prudent man ought to act upon the supposition that those
facts exist or did happen. On the other hand if a prima
facie case has not been made out it means that there is no
material evidence which can be believed in the sense as
described earlier. In order to make a finding either way
the court must, at the close of the case for the prosecution,
undertake a positive evaluation of the credibility and
reliability of all the evidence adduced so as to determine
whether the elements of the offence has been established.”
[25] In Public Prosecutor v. Mohd Radzi bin Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ
457; [2005] 6 AMR 203 the Federal Court laid down the various
steps to be undertaken by a trial court at the end of the
prosecution’s case in the following terms:
“(i) the close of the prosecution’s case, subject the
evidence led by the prosecution in its totality to a
maximum evaluation. Carefully scrutinise the credibility of
each of the prosecution’s witnesses. Take into account all
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the
evidence. If the evidence admits of two or more inferences,
then draw the inference that is most favourable to the
accused;
(ii) ask yourself the question: If I now call upon the
accused to make his defence and he elects to remain silent
am I prepared to convict him on the evidence now before
me? If the answer to that evidence is “Yes”, then a prima
facie case has been made out and the defence should be
called. If the answer is “No” then, a
(iii) prima facie case has not been made out and the
accused should be acquitted;

15



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

(iv) after the defence is called, the accused elects to
remain silent, then convict;
(v) after defence is called, the accused elects to give
evidence, then go through the steps set out in Mat v. PP
[1963] 1 LNS 82; [1963] MLJ 263.”
[26] Applying the principles laid down in the above-mentioned
authorities, it is thus the duty of a trial court at the conclusion of
the close of the case for the prosecution, to undertake a
maximum evaluation of the evidence adduced by the
prosecution. This evaluation also involves an assessment of the
credibility of the evidence adduced as tested against the
circumstances of the case as a whole. Should more than one
inference arise out of the evidence given, the inference
favourable to the accused must be adopted.
[27] After having subjected the evidences of the Prosecution to
maximum evaluation, the question must be asked, “if I call upon
the accused to make his defence and he elects to remain silent,
am I prepared to convict him on the evidence as it now stands.”
If the answer to that question is yes, then, a prima facie case is
made out but not if it is otherwise. With the above well
established principles in the forefront of the mind of this court,
the process of assessment and evaluation of the evidence and the
witnesses for the prosecution was consequently undertaken.
[28] Bearing in mind the provisions of section 180 of the Criminal
Procedure Code as stated above, the principles enunciated in
case law aforementioned on what constitutes a ‘prima facie’
case, and having evaluated the evidences and testimonies of the
witnesses for the prosecution, this court then posed the
following question to itself; If I now call upon the Accused to

16



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

make his defence and he elects to remain silent, am I prepared to
convict him on the evidence now before me?
[29] Having given the question posed serious consideration, this
court found the answer to that question to be a positive yes.
Accordingly this court held that the Prosecution had succeeded
in making out a prima facie case against the Accused and
consequently called upon the Accused to enter his defence. The
three alternatives of giving evidence on sworn oath, making a
statement from the dock and electing to remain silent were duly
explained to the Accused. The Accused elected to give sworn
evidence on oath from the witness stand.
DUTY OF THE COURT AT THE END OF THE DEFENCE’S
CASE
[30] The duty of a trial court at the conclusion of the Defence’s case
is laid down in section 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code
which reads as follows:
“182A - Procedure at the conclusion of the trial
(1) At the conclusion of the trial, the Court shall consider
all the evidence adduced before it and shall decide whether
the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable
doubt.
(2) If the Court finds that the prosecution has proved its
case beyond reasonable doubt, the Court shall find the
accused guilty and he may be convicted on it.
(3) If the Court finds that the prosecution has not proved
its case beyond reasonable doubt, the Court shall record an
order of acquittal.

[31] In Md Zainudin bin Raujan v. Public Prosecutor [2013] 4 CLJ
21; [2013] 3 MLJ 773, the Federal Court observed as follows:
“At the conclusion of the trial, s. 182A of the Criminal
Procedure Code imposes a duty on the trial court to
consider all the evidence adduced before it and to decide
whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt. The defence of the accused must be
considered in the totality of the evidence adduced by the
prosecution, as well as in the light of the well established
principles enunciated in Mat v. Public Prosecutor [1963] 1
MLJ 263 with regard to the approach to be taken in
evaluating the evidence of the defence.”
[32] In the case of Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji
Idris & Ors [1977] 1 LNS 92; [1977] 1 MLJ 180 Abdoolcader J
(as he then was) explained the phrase ‘reasonable doubt’ as
follows:
“It is not necessary for the defence to prove anything and
all that is necessary for the accused to do is to give an
explanation that is reasonable and throws a reasonable
doubt on the case made out for the prosecution. It cannot
be a fanciful or whimsical or imaginary doubt, and in
considering the question as to whether a reasonable doubt
has been raised, the evidence adduced by and the case for
the defence must be viewed in at least some amount of
light, not necessarily bright sunlight, but certainly not
against the dark shadows of the night.”
[33] Apart from what amounts to a reasonable doubt
the cases above, the correct thought process
should be followed by a trial court in the
evaluation of the defence’s evidence is that as
18

as defined from
and stages that
assessment and
encapsulated in

Legal Network Series

the case of Mat v. Public Prosecutor [1963] 1 LNS 82; [1963]
29 MLJ 263 where Suffian J (as he then was) held as follows:
“The position may be conveniently stated as follows:(a) If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the
accused’s guilt, Convict.
(b) If you accept or believe the accused’s explanation,
Acquit.
(c) If you do not accept or believe the accused’s
explanation Do not convict but consider the next steps
below.
(d) If you do not accept or believe the accused’s
explanation and that explanation does not raise in your
mind a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, Convict.
(e) If you do not accept or believe the accused’s
explanation but nevertheless it raises in your mind a
reasonable doubt as to his guilt, Acquit.”
[34] The approach in Mat v. Public Prosecutor was judicially
endorsed by the Federal Court as being the correct one to adopt
when evaluating the evidence of the defence’s case in Public
Prosecutor v. Mohd Radzi Bin Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ 457;
[2005] 6 MLJ 393 when it held:
“For the guidance of the courts below, we summarise as
follows the steps that should be taken by a trial court at
the close of the prosecution’s case:
(i) the close of the prosecution’s case, subject the evidence
led by the prosecution in its totality to a maximum
evaluation. Carefully scrutinise the credibility of each of
19



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

the prosecution’s witnesses. Take into account all
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that
evidence. If the evidence admits of two or more inferences,
then draw the inference that is most favourable to the
accused;
(ii) ask yourself the question: If I now call upon the
accused to make his defence and he elects to remain silent
am I prepared to convict him on the evidence now before
me? If the answer to that question is ‘Yes’, then a prima
facie case has been made out and the defence should be
called. If the answer is ‘No’ then, a prima facie case has
not been made out and the accused should be acquitted;
(iii) after the defence is called, the accused elects to
remain silent, then convict;
(iv) after defence is called, the accused elects to give
evidence, then go through the steps set out in Mat v.
Public Prosecutor [1963] 1 LNS 82; [1963] MLJ 263.”
[35] As can be gleaned from the above authorities, if the court does
not accept or believe the defence raised by the accused it must
not convict but must proceed a stage further by considering
whether the defence evidence has raised in the mind of the court
a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. If it does, then
the accused is nevertheless entitled to an acquittal. In the light
of the above well-defined principles, this court, being so guided,
proceeded to undertake the evaluation of the evidence for the
defence.
EVALUATION OF THE DEFENCE CASE
THE DEFENCE’S VERSION
20



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

[36] The Accused testified that he had been working in Bintulu for
about 10 years before the incident and had known the Deceased
since 2007. They had been good friends all the while and prior
to the incident, the Deceased had been unemployed for about 3
months and staying in PW5’s quarters as the Deceased was
unemployed.
[37] The Accused further testified that the night before the incident
the Accused and the Deceased were together and the Deceased
had given the Accused some Syabu to consume at Segan
Factory. The Accused did not go to sleep and went back to his
own quarters early in the morning. The Accused then decided to
go to the Canteen at Fo Shan Sawmill and get some cigarettes
and in the process went to the Deceased’s quarters. The Accused
did not bring any objects or weapons with him. As the Accused
arrived at the Deceased’s quarters, he saw a lady leaving the
quarters. The Deceased then demanded money from the Accused
for the Syabu that was given to him, the night before. The
Accused told the Deceased that he did not have money as he had
just come back from Indonesia. The Deceased then pointed a
knife at the Accused and hit the back of the Accused’s right
shoulder with it. A struggle ensued during which the Accused
got hold of the knife from the Deceased and stabbed him. The
Accused had lost his sense of self-control at the time of the
incident and the Accused felt that if he did not react then the
Deceased would have killed him.
[38] The Defence contended that the question of whether the Accused
brought along the knife with him when he went to see the
Accused or did the Accused seize it from the Deceased will have
a great impact in deciding whether the Accused is a credible
witness or not. The Defence further contended that the Accused

21



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

is a credible witness and his version of events ought to be
accepted as facts.
THE DEFENCES OF THE ACCUSED PERSON
[39] From a perusal of the evidence adduced by the defence, the
defence is relying on the defences of defence of provocation,
sudden fight and self-defence. All of these will now be
considered in turn.
[40] The Accused testified that he had to defend himself from being
stabbed by the Deceased and that he was in a condition of
unstable mind and lost his power of self-control. The Deceased
first provoked him while holding the knife 22 (Exhibit P18A &
P19A) claiming that the Accused owed him the sum of RM1200
for syabu and asked the Accused to pay the debt.
THE DEFENCE OF PROVOCATION AND SUDDEN FIGHT
[41] Provocation operates as an exception to the offence of murder
under section 300 of the Penal Code.
Exception 1-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender,
whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden
provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the
provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake
or accident.
[42] The above exception is subject to the following provisos:
(a) that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily
provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing
harm to any person;

22



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

(b) that the provocation is not given by anything done in
obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful
exercise of the powers of such public servant;
(c) that the provocation is not given by anything done in
the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
Explanation-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden
enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder, is a
question of fact.
[43] Before proceeding to consider the elements of the exception of
provocation, it is also pertinent to consider the burden on an
accused where he relies on an exception in the Penal Code. The
relevant section is section 105 of the Evidence Act 1950 and it
reads as follows:
“105. Burden of proving that case of accused comes within
exceptions
When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of
proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case
within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or
within any special exception or proviso contained in any
other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the
offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the
absence of those circumstances.”
[44] The classic common law definition of provocation can be found
in the case of R v. Duffy [1949] 1 All ER 932 where Devlin J
said:
“Provocation is some act, or series of acts done (or words
spoken)... which would cause in any reasonable person and
actually causes in the accused, a sudden and temporary
23



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to
passion as to make him or her for the moment not master
of himself.”
[45] The provocation must be grave and sudden. This is a question of
fact in each individual case. Dr Sri Hari Singh Gour’s Penal;
Law of India, Vol 3 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt. Ltd, 1 th Ed
Revised, 2011), declares “sudden” as follows (at p 2498):
“What it is said that the provocation must be “sudden” it is
implied that it should have all immediately preceded the
homicide in point of time. A person may repeated or
continuous provocation arouse another to state of mind
when the provocation immediately preceding the act is
only the last straw.”
[46] In Mahmood v. State AIR [1961] ALL 538, Oak J had noted (at
538-539):
“Whether the provocation was sudden or not does not
present much difficulty. The word ‘sudden’ involves two
elements. Firstly, the provocation must be unexpected. If
an accused plans in advance to receive a provocation in
order to justify the subsequent homicide, the provocation
cannot be said to be sudden. Secondly, the interval
between the provocation and the homicide should be brief.
If a man giving the provocation is killed within a minute
after the provocation, it is a case of sudden provocation. If
the man is killed six hours after the provocation, it is not a
case of sudden provocation.”
[47] In the Court of Appeal case of Rikky Purba v. Public Prosecutor
[2014] 3 CLJ 607; [2014] MLJU 72, the court reviewed the
authorities on provocation and held inter alia as follows:

24



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

“It is an established principle of criminal jurisprudence
that the defence is not required to prove its case with the
same rigour as the prosecution and the defence is only
required to prove its case on the balance of probabilities to
entitle him to rely on any general exceptions of the PC
(see section 105 of the Evidence Act).”
[48] In PP v. Subir Gole [2015] 3 CLJ 505, the Court held as
follows;
“[28] In order to appreciate the contention of learned
DPP, it would be useful to have a look at the law relating
to provocation. Exception 1 to s. 300 of the PC operates as
a mitigatory or partial defence to murder aimed at the
reduction of that offence to simple culpable homicide not
amounting to murder. The doctrine of provocation is a
concession to human frailty or infirmity, a recognition that
a lower standard of criminal responsibility should apply to
one who kills when he is ‘for the moment not master of his
mind’. This approach to defence hinges on the notion of
loss of self-control. Its rationale is that provocative
conduct, when it is sufficiently serious, is capable of
inflaming anger to such degree as to be likely to lead the
provoked person to lose his self-control and retaliate in
violence. When the provoked person loses self-control, he
is unable to weigh up the consequences for his action
according to reason. (See Jeremy Horder, Provocation and
Responsibility (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992)).
[29] ‘Provocation has not been defined in the PC.
Generally speaking, there are three main types of
provocations, namely:
(i)

Ordinary provocation (reasonable);
25



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

(ii)

Cumulative provocation; and

(iii) Self-induced provocation.
[30] Ordinary provocation refers to that provocation
which causes a man to lose his self-control; and although
a reasonable man who has lost control over himself would
not kill, yet his homicidal reaction to the provocation is at
least understandable. This form of provocation is based on
the standard of the reasonable or ordinary man.
[31] Cumulative provocation is a series of acts or words
over a period of time which culminates in the sudden and
temporary loss of self-control. This provocation is not
confined to the last acts before killing the accused; there
may have been previous acts or words which when added,
caused the accused to lose his self-control although the
last act may not be sufficient to cause provocation.
[32] Self-induced provocation is a form of provocation in
which the accused himself started the trouble. This type of
provocation is rarely successful as a defence owing to the
fact that the accused actually ‘provoked’ himself and may
be rendered responsible for his own anger because he
started the trouble himself.
[33] What would amount to “grave and sudden
provocation” will depend on the facts of each case. Thus,
no straitjacket formula that can be evolved to categories
what acts may amount to provocation much less grave and
sudden provocation. In the case of Che Omar Mohd Akhir
v. PP (supra), Nik Hashim FCJ said:

26



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

[14] The question whether the provocation was grave and
sudden such as to make the accused to lose his self-control
is a question of fact and not one of law (see Explanation to
Exception 1 to s. 300 of the PC; Kuan Ted Fatt v. Public
Prosecutor [1985] 1 CLJ 150; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 174 FC).
Each case is to be considered according to its own facts.
The court must decide on the particular circumstances of
that case whether the provocation was grave and sudden
enough to permit an indulgent view of the crime committed
by the accused, (see Ratanlal & Dhirajlal, The Indian
Penal Code, 29 th edn. 2002 p 1194).
[15] The test of grave and sudden provocation was clearly
stated in the Supreme Court case of Lorensus Tukan v.
Public Prosecutor [1988] 1 CLJ 143; [1988] 1 CLJ (Rep)
162. Seah SCJ in delivering the judgment of the court said:
The test of ‘grave and sudden’ provocation is whether a
reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as
the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused
was placed would be so provoked as to lose his selfcontrol (see Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra AIR [1962]
SC 605, 530).
In determining what amounts to grave and sudden
provocation the court may take into account the habits,
manners and feelings of the class or community to which
the accused belongs, but not of the particular
idiosyncrasies of the accused: Madhavan v. State of
Kerala AIR [1966] Ker. 258 (260).
[16] It is also said that the defence of provocation is a
dual one: the alleged provocative conduct must be such as
(i) actually causes in the accused, and (ii) might cause in a
27



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

reasonable man, a sudden and temporary loss of selfcontrol as the result of which he kills the deceased.
[17] Thus, in order to successfully set up provocation as a
defence for the reduction of the offence of murder to one of
culpable homicide not amounting to murder, it is not
enough to show that the accused was provoked into losing
his self- control; it must be shown that the provocation
was grave and sudden and must have by its gravity and
suddenness caused a reasonable man to lose his selfcontrol and induced him to do the act which caused the
death of the deceased. In determining that question the
court may also consider, along with other factors, the
nature of the retaliation by the accused, having regard to
the nature of the provocation. (see Ratanlal & Dhirajlal, p
1192; Vijayan v. Public Prosecutor [1975] 1 LNS 189;
[1975] 2 MLJ 8).
[49] In the Federal Court case of Ikau anak Mail v. Public Prosecutor
[1973] 1 LNS 51, his Lordship Azmi LP (as he then was) ruled
as follows:
“To succeed in a defence of grave and sudden provocation,
it is necessary in law for the defence to satisfy the Court
that not only by the acts of the deceased that the accused
had been deprived of the power of self-control, but such
acts of provocation would also have deprived a reasonable
man of the power of self-control.”
[50] As alluded to earlier, the test of whether provocation exists is to
be judged by the standard of the reasonable man. See Lorensus
Tukan v. Public Prosecutor [1988] 1 CLJ Rep 162; [1988] 1
MLJ 251 which held as follows:

28



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

“The test of ‘grave and sudden’ provocation is whether a
reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as
the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused
was placed would be so provoked as to lose his selfcontrol (see Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra AIR [1962]
SC 605 530).”
[51] Was the provocation by the Deceased, grave and sudden? This, as
the established authorities decided, is a question of fact. In the
present case, the evidence relied upon by the Defence in raising
provocation are as follows. The Accused testified that the
Deceased then pointed a knife at the Accused and hit the back of
the Accused’s right shoulder with it. A struggle ensued between
them during which the Accused got hold of the knife from the
Deceased and stabbed him. The Accused had lost his sense of selfcontrol at the time of the incident and the Accused felt that if he
did not react then the Deceased would have killed him.
[52] From a distillation of the foregoing narrative that formed part of
the Accused’s testimony, this Court has to determine whether
the Deceased pointing a knife at the Accused and hit the back of
the Accused’s right shoulder with it and the struggle which
ensued between them during which the Accused got hold of the
knife from the Deceased and stabbed him, was sufficient to
cause the Accused to be deprived of his self - control?
[53] If it was, the next stage of inquiry would be whether the injury
inflicted was proportionate to the provocation. It is trite that the
test of whether provocation exists is to be judged by the
standard of the reasonable man. In the present case, in the
assessment of the reasonableness of the Accused’s action, it has
to be considered as of necessity whether a reasonable man would
be so provoked as to act as the Accused did. Therefore it must

29



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

follow that if a reasonable man would not have resorted to the
degree of retaliation as the Accused did, then it must also follow
that the proportionality of the reaction to the provocation would
be a relevant factor to consider. If there is any doubt that the
consideration of proportionality is relevant to the issue of
provocation, this Court is guided by the case of Bangkong ak
Puan (l) v. Public Prosecutor [2012] 1 LNS 950; [2013] 1 MLJ
293 where it was held;
“The appellant alleged that the deceased stabbed him first
and it was this act of grave and sudden provocation that
purportedly caused him to lose his self-control and
retaliate. We find that even if this allegation was true, the
brutal manner in which the appellant retaliated was not
proportionate to the provocation.”
[54] As stated earlier, the test of whether provocation exists is to be
judged by the standard of the reasonable man. See Lorensus
Tukan v. Public Prosecutor [1988] 1 CLJ Rep 162; [1988] 1
MLJ 251 which held as follows:
“The test of ‘grave and sudden’ provocation is whether a
reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as
the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused
was placed would be so provoked as to lose his selfcontrol (see Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra AIR [1962]
SC 605 530).”
[55] Would a reasonable person react as the Accused did under the
circumstances of the present case? Cumulatively taken, the acts
relied upon to show evidence of provocation on the part of the
Accused were that the Deceased had pointed a knife at him and
attacked him unsuccessfully the Deceased then pointed a knife at
the Accused and hit the back of the Accused’s right shoulder
30

with it. A struggle ensued between them during which the
Accused got hold of the knife from the Deceased and stabbed
him. The Accused had lost his sense of self-control at the time
of the incident and the Accused felt that if he did not react then
the Deceased would have killed him.
THE
EXPERT
TESTIMONY
PATHOLOGIST PW17

OF

THE

FORENSIC

[56] In proving the death of the Deceased, the prosecution is relying
on the evidence adduced by the pathologist in this case, Dr.
Norliza Binti Ibrahim (PW17) who testified that she had
conducted the post mortem on the Deceased on 1.4.2015 at about
11.20 am at mortuary of the Bintulu Hospital, Sarawak. PW17
concluded that based on the post mortem examination and her
opinion, the Deceased died of chest injury due to stab wounds.
External examination of the Deceased revealed that the
Deceased suffered six marks of injuries which were caused by
sharp force trauma. Three of the injuries were stab wounds and
the other three were incisions. The stab wounds were consistent
to be caused by sharp and pointed object such as a knife or any
other similar object. The stab wounds were consistent with
injuries caused by single edge blade. The width of the stab
wounds ranged from 1.3 cm – 1.9 cm. The deepest depth of the
stab wounds was 11.6 cm. PW17 clarified that what was in her
post mortem report, at line 6 of paragraph 2 at page 5 that the
deepest depth of the stab wounds was 9.5 cm which was the
result of typing error.
[57] PW17 further testified that while the incisions were consistent
with wounds caused by sharp object such as knife, sword,
parang or any other similar object. Stab wound injury which was

31



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

marked by no. 2 caused injury to the heart while stab wound
which was marked no. 3 caused injury to the left lung. These
injuries subsequently also leads to bleeding into the heart sac
and lung cavities. In PW17’s opinion, these chest injuries due to
stab wounds led to the Deceased’s death and the rest of the
injuries were not severe enough to lead to his death. The said
injuries which were marked as no. 2 and 3 respectively could
lead to death as a result either by excessive bleeding or by
disrupting the breathing process which subsequently causing the
body as a whole not receiving enough oxygen. The cause of
death of the Deceased was chest injury due to stab wounds. In
her opinion, in the ordinary course of nature these injuries on
the Deceased’s body mainly on the chest could lead to death of
the deceased. (Refer to WS-PW17, page 6-7)
[58] The Deceased did not have any disease that could cause or
contributed to his death. In PW17’s opinion, the Deceased did
not suffer any injuries consistent with defensive wounds.
Defensive wound is wound that suffered by a person in order to
ward off the attacker. This injury usually could be seen on the
inner part of the forearms (ulna side) and also on the palms
especially if sharp force trauma is involved.
[59] This Court also finds that the act of the Accused in stabbing the
Deceased several times is out of all proportion to the
provocation given by the Deceased. Even assuming that the
Accused is to be believed in that the Deceased did indeed point
a knife at the Accused and hit the back of the Accused’s right
shoulder with it, this Court finds that it was unnecessary for the
Accused to have used the knife to stab the Deceased several
times. After the Deceased’s initial attack against the Accused
which resulted in the Accused seizing possession of the knife,
the Accused could have, in the first instance moved away from
32



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

the Deceased and in the worst case scenario he could have gone
out of the room safely since he had possession of the knife.
[60] On the issue of proportionality, it must be remembered that the
stab wounds inflicted numbered no less than six, the deepest of
the stab wounds was 11.6 cm and the width of the stab wounds
ranged from 1.3 cm to 1.9 cm. The fatal wounds no. 2 and 3
which were inflicted directed to vital organs, namely the heart
and the left lung. The evidence of PW17 and her post mortem
report also confirmed that these injuries subsequently also leads
to bleeding into the heart sac and lung cavities. In PW17’s
opinion, these chest injuries due to stab wounds led to the
Deceased’s death. In all of the circumstances therefore, this
Court finds that the Accused has failed on a balance of
probability to bring himself within Exception 1 to section 300 of
the Penal Code namely, provocation.
DEFENCE OF SUDDEN FIGHT
[61] Exception 4 to this exception to section 300 of the Penal Code
reads as follows - Culpable homicide is not murder if it is
committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of
passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having
taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
Explanation-It is immaterial in such cases which party
offers the provocation or commits the first assault.
[62] The facts upon which this exception arises are similar to that of
provocation under exception 1 to section 300 Penal Code. It is
trite law that to invoke the exception, four requisites must be
satisfied, that is to say: (i) it was a sudden fight; (ii) there was
no premeditation; (iii) the act was committed in the heat of

33



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

passion; and (iv) the assailant had not taken any undue
advantage or acted in a cruel manner.
[63] These requirements are cumulative and must all be satisfied for
the exception to apply. In the present case, on the facts and in
the circumstances of the case, this Court finds that requirement
(iv) to exception 4 above has not been satisfied by the Accused.
It will be recalled that according to the evidence of PW17 and
her post mortem report, there were three stab wounds and three
incisions inflicted on the Deceased, two of which proved to be
fatal. This was in purported retaliation for the Deceased’s action
to trying to stab the Accused. It will also be recalled that PW17
had testified that there appeared to be no defensive wounds
found on the Deceased indicating that he was not in a position to
defend himself from the attack of the Accused. It is therefore the
finding of this Court that the reaction of the Accused was out of
all proportion to the provocation given by the Deceased. This
Court finds that in the circumstances, the Accused’s reaction
clearly indicated that he had taken undue advantage and acted in
a cruel and unusual manner. In the case of Sainal Abidin bin
Mading v. Public Prosecutor [1999] 4 CLJ 215; [1999] 4 MLJ
497 the court observed as follows:
“The learned judge also found that by using P16 to stab
the deceased not once but four times including once when
the deceased had collapsed, obviously reflected a situation
where the appellant had taken advantage or acted in a
cruel or unusual manner thereby failing to pass the second
test required under exception 4. It was not disputed by the
defence that P16 was used by the appellant to inflict those
injuries on the deceased. Hence the appellant failed also
under exception 4.”

[64] This Court therefore finds that the Accused has under the
circumstances failed on balance of probabilities to bring himself
within exception 4 to section 300 of the Penal Code, namely,
that of sudden fight.
THE DEFENCE OF SELF DEFENCE
[65] Sections 96-106 of the Penal Code codifies the law relating to
right of private defence of person and property including the
extent of and limitation to exercise such right. Section 96 of the
Penal Code states:
“Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the
right of private defence.”
[66] Ratanlal and Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes (25 th Ed) laid down 4
pre-requisities which must be met before the plea of self-defence
can succeed and they are as follows:
(a) the accused must be free from fault in bringing about
the encounter;
(b) there must be present an impending peril to life or of
great bodily harm either real or so apparent;
(c) there must be no safe or reasonable mode of escape by
retreat; and
(d) there must have been necessity of taking life.
[67] Section 105 of the Evidence Act 1950 places the burden of
proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within
any general exception in the Penal Code is upon the accused.
[68] Section 97 of the Penal Code states:

Legal Network Series

“Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions
contained in section 99, to defend(a) his own body, and the body of any other person,
against any offence affecting the human body;
(b) the property, whether movable or immovable, of
himself or of any other person, against any act which
is an offence falling under the definition of theft,
robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an
attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or
criminal trespass.
[69] Section 99 of the Penal Code laid down the parameters for the
defence of private defence, which states as follows:
“(1) There is no right of private defence against an act
which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death
or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a
public servant acting in good faith under colour of his
office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by
law.
(2) There is no right of private defence against an act
which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death
or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by
the direction of a public servant acting in good faith under
colour of his office, though that direction may not be
strictly justifiable by law.
(3) There is no right of private defence in cases in which
there is time to have recourse to the protection of the
public authorities.

[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

(4) The right of private defence in no case extends to the
inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for
the purpose of defence.”
[70] Section 102 of the Penal Code reads
“The right of private defence of the body commences as
soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body
arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence,
though the offence may not have been committed; and it
continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the
body continues.”
[71] In the Court of Appeal case of Frans Hiu v. PP & Another
Appeal [2014] 9 CLJ 764, the Court of Appeal held inter alia as
follows:
“[25] The right of private defence commences as soon as
there is a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body
of a person and that right continues for as long as the
danger exits. (see PP v. Ngoi Ming Sean [1981] CLJ 93;
[1981] CLJ (Rep) 251; [1982] 1 MLJ 24, Ya Daud v. PP
[1996] 2 CLJ 540; [1997] 4 MLJ 322, PP v. Dato’
Balwant Singh (No 2) [2003] 7 CLJ 285; [2003] 3 MLJ
395).
[26] Section 99 of the Penal Code provides a limitation to
the right of private defence. If an accused person has time
to have recourse to seek the protection of a public
authority or inflicts more harm than necessary for the
purpose of defending his person, he can not avail himself
of the protection provided by the defence.”

[72] Section 105 of the Evidence Act 1950 places the burden of
proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within
any general exception in the Penal Code is upon the Accused.
The facts of the present case clearly show that, firstly, in spite
of the Accused’s testimony, there was no impending peril to his
life or of great bodily harm after he had obtained possession of
the knife.
[73] Further as already considered above, the Accused, could have
either pushed the Deceased away or have taken flight from the
scene and so escaped by way of retreat. The number of stabs
wounds inflicted upon the Deceased also was not proportionate
in the circumstances of the case as the Deceased was not armed
with any weapon at the material time as the knife was already
taken away from him based on the testimony of the Accused and
the manner of retaliation by using such a weapon and aiming for
the vital organs of the Deceased was out of all proportion in the
circumstances.
[74] In the circumstances therefore, this Court finds that the Accused
has failed on a balance of probabilities to show that he is
entitled to rely on the exception of self defence.
CREDIBILITY OF THE ACCUSED
[75] According to the Accused, since the Deceased pointed a knife at
him and threatened to stab him if he did not pay the RM1200.00
debt, he was in a state of fear and felt threatened. The Deceased
then hit his back right shoulder with the knife handle and the
knife fell so the Accused took the opportunity to grab the knife
and there was struggle between the Accused and the Deceased.
This is what the Accused testified: -

38



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

“Q57:

When you entered the quarters Erwing was in,
what was the first thing you said to him or he said
to you?

A:

When I entered the house, he said “Pay your debt”
in the Bugis language. I said to him, “I do not
have the money. I had just started working”. In
anger, he pointed a knife at me. Then I avoided
the attack but yet the knife hit me on the back of
my right shoulder.”

[76] From the Accused’s above testimony, the Accused testified that
the Deceased pointed a knife at him and he never testified that
the Deceased attacked him. This Court also finds that the
Deceased’s act of pointing a knife is not an act of attacking nor
is it an act of provocation. At best, it can be construed as a
threat or an act of warning. Furthermore, the Accused never
explained how the Deceased who was holding the knife, could
change position and hit the back of the Accused’s shoulder. If it
was true that the back of the Accused’s right shoulder was hit, it
must be the blade of the knife which hit it and not the handle of
the knife because the Deceased was holding the handle before
the knife fell. There should be at least a cut or scratch found of
the back of the Accused’s right shoulder but there was none. In
the light of the aforesaid, this Court finds that the Accused’s
testimony is contradictory and not credible.
[77] This Court noted that no one else saw the fight between the
Accused and the Deceased. Thus the Accused is at liberty to
testify on whatever matters he wished and in the light of such
circumstances, the Accused’s testimony must be viewed
critically.

39



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

[78] The injuries inflicted by the Accused on the Deceased showed
that the Accused had the intention of attacking and causing
injury or even death to the Deceased. It is highly probable that
the Accused attacked the Deceased because the Accused did not
suffer any injuries such as cuts, wound, incision and stab on any
part of his body except the scratch on his right back arm as
compared to the injuries suffered by the Deceased. This scratch
could be caused by any other possibility and it might occurred
before the incident as he worked in a sawmill. The depth and
size of the injuries found on the Deceased’s body showed that
the Accused really wanted or intended to injure the Deceased
fatally.
[79] Other witnesses such as PW16, Inspector Peterson Ray testified
that when he saw the Accused after the incident, the Accused
looked calm, normal and healthy. PW16 did not see any fresh
blood or injuries except a long scratch on his right backside of
his arm. PW16 also testified that when he asked the Accused to
change into lock up attire at CID Office so that he can seize his
clothing and shoes as the exhibits for this case. When the
Accused was changing his clothes, PW16 saw no injuries on any
parts of his body. PW21 as the Investigating Officer of this case
also had testified that there were no other injuries found on the
Accused’s body except a long scratch on the right backside of
the Accused. Thus this Court finds that the testimony of the
Accused that he was attacked by the Deceased and suffered an
injury is not credible.
[80] The Accused also testified that the Deceased had given syabu to
him at 1.00 pm at Segan Factory on 28.3.2015 where both of
them had consumed the syabu. However based on Exhibit P50,
the chemist report stated that Common Basic Drugs and Alcohol
were not detected from the Deceased’s blood. If the Accused’s
40



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

evidence was credible, Methampetamine, a dangerous drugs
should had been detected in the Deceased’s blood.
[81] The Accused also gave contradictory evidence as based on
Q&A49 of his Examination in Chief, he stated that there was
nobody else inside the Deceased’s quarters when he went there
but later on agreed that Normawaty was inside the quarters with
the Accused and during Re Examination he testified that
Normawaty was leaving the quarters when he entered the
quarters. Thus there are discrepancies in his evidence. The
Accused’s evidence which can be seen in Q&A 38 of his CrossExamination, Q&A 69 and Q&A 75 of his Examination in chief
also contradicted each other.
WHETHER THE DEFENCE HAS RAISED A REASONABLE
DOUBT ON THE PROSECUTION’S CASE
[82] ‘Reasonable doubt’ had been defined in the case of PP v. Saimin
[1971] 2 MLJ 16 as follows:
“It is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating
to human affairs and depending upon moral evidence is
open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state
of the case which after the entire comparison and
consideration of all the evidence leaves the minds of the
jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an
abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the
charge. It has again been said that “reasonable doubt” is
the doubt which makes you hesitate as to the correctness of
the conclusion which you reach. If under your oaths and
upon your consciences, after you have fully investigated
the evidence and compared it in all its parts, you say to
yourself I doubt if he is guilty, then it is a reasonable
doubt. It is a doubt which settles in your judgment and

41



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

finds a resting place there. Or as sometimes said, it must
be a doubt so solemn and substantial as to produce in the
minds of the jurors some uncertainty as to the verdict to be
given. A reasonable doubt must be a doubt arising from
the evidence or want of evidence and cannot be an
imaginary doubt or conjecture unrelated to evidence.”
[83] In the case of Liew Kah Ling & Ors v. Public Prosecutor [1960]
1 LNS 60; [1960] MLJ 306 Thompson CJ referred to the
quantum of proof required to prove a case “beyond reasonable
doubt” when he quoted the judgment of Denning J (as he then
was) in the case of Miller v. Minister of Pensions as follows:
“The degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but
it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond
reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow
of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it
admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of
justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to
leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be
dismissed with the sentence’ of course it is possible, but
not in the least probable’ the case is proved beyond
reasonable doubt but nothing short of that will suffice.”
Denning J went on to observe further in Miller’s case:
“That evidence that is in the least probable must be
evidence that is credible, plausible or logical such
that a reasonable person, having regard to the
ordinary course of nature or natural events, human
conduct, and in the particular circumstances of the
particular case, would accept it as to act upon it as
having occurred, or as truthful or accurate; and not
a doubt that could, with the application of some
42



[2017] 1 LNS 1322

Legal Network Series

ingenuity, be conjured up, envisioned or visualised in
a story.”
[84] In the light of this Court’s above findings, this Court finds that
the Accused has failed to prove his defences of private defence
and grave and sudden provocation as this Court does not accept
or believe the said defences raised by the Accused and also finds
that the Defence’s evidence has not raised in the mind of this
Court, a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the Accused.
ORDER
[85] In the premises this Court finds that the Defence has failed to
discharge the burden of proving the existence of circumstances
bringing its case within any of the exceptions referred to above
on a balance of probabilities, as are contained in the Penal Code,
and has also failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution
case for murder under section 302 of the Penal Code. This court
therefore finds the Accused guilty of murder punishable under
section 302 of the Penal Code. This Court therefore sentences
the Accused to the only sentence permissible by law, that is to
death by hanging.
