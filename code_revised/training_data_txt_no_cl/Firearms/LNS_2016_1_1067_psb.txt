PROSECUTION CASE

[2] The pertinent facts as disclosed by the prosecution case was that
on 21.10.2010, SP9 assembled two teams in order to carry out a raid
in Penang in respect to drug trafficking activities. SP9 and his team
headed for Penang and after arrival carried out preliminary
6



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

observation on the target location at 1-03-09, The Spring
Condominium, Lebuh Sg. Pinang, George Town, Penang (“said
premises”) at around 10.30p.m. After the said observation, which
lasted for about 15 minutes, headed back to their accommodation.
[3] On 22.10.2010 at around 9.30 a.m. SP17 and a team were
briefed by SP19 regarding a raid to be carried out on the said
premises. After the briefing, at around 10.30 a.m., teams headed by
SP17 and SP19 respectively headed toward the premises in two
departmental vehicles.
[4] At around 11.00 a.m., both teams arrived in front of the target
premises and observation was carried out using binoculars for around
15 to 20 minutes. As a result of the observation, SP17 saw the
silhouettes of people moving around the target premises. SP17 then
informed the results of his observation to SP19.
[5] SP19 then instructed a raid to be carried out on the said
premises. Upon arrival at level 3 of the building, SP17 found unit
no.9 and shouted for the occupants to open the door for inspection in
the premises but there was no response. SP17 found that the front grill
of the premises was locked and padlocked.
[6] The front wooden door was also locked. SP17 knocked the grill
using the padlock but there was still no response. SP17 shouted
“police” and instructed the door to be opened but there was still no
response. SP17 then instructed D/L Kpl Zulkifli to cut open the
padlock on the grill. The grill was then forced opened. After the grill
was prised open, SP17 instructed Konst. Adli Hafiz to break open the
wooden door using a “door ram”.
[7] After the wooden door was forced opened, SP17, SP19 and the
police team entered the premises and found at the end of the
passageway to a room, two male Indians in the master bedroom. SP17

7



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

witnessed the first accused standing while the second accused was
mixing a powdery substance in a basin with both his hands.
[8] SP17 and his team arrested both accused who attempted to
unsuccessfully flee toward the direction of the door to the room. SP17
explained to both accused his reasons for their arrest but they just
remained silent. SP17 carried out a physical examination on both
accused.
[9] Witnessed by both accused, SP17 and his team together with
SP19 carried out an examination in the room where the accused were
arrested. They found various equipment and chemical believed to be
used to process drugs. Drugs and other substances of various types as
per the third to the fifth charge were also found there. Also found
were a P.Berreta M45038Z pistol, an empty bullet cartridge and 13
9MM Luger bullets as per the first and second charges.
[10] After SP17 seized the exhibits, he made markings on all the
exhibits and listed all the exhibits in a police report, search lists and
handover of exhibits acknowledgment lists respectively. SP17 handed
over all the exhibits relating to the narcotics found to SP25 while he
handed over the exhibits relating to the pistol, cartridge and
ammunition to SP20.
[11] SP17 also found two set of keys in the living room. SP21 then
carried out further investigation and found the following:
i)

Keys marked 1, 2, 5, and 6 (Yale) fitted the doors to the 4
rooms;

ii)

Key marked 3 (Honda) fitted the letter box to no.1-03-09
located at the end of the block;

which had No.1-03-09 written;

Key marked 9 fitted the padlock Richdoor Top. Keys
marked 7 until 9 were found on a metal red key chain.

[12] All the exhibits were received by SP25 were sent to the chemist
for analysis.
Prosecution’s application under section 32 Evidence Act 1950
[13] During the course of its case, the prosecution applied to admit
the statement of one Caroline a/l Patrick (Caroline) recorded under
section 112 Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) pursuant to section 32
Evidence Act 1950. Results of investigation conducted by SP21
revealed that the said Caroline Patrick is the wife of the first accused.
[14] After I heard submissions from parties, I disallowed the
application by the prosecution under section 32 Evidence Act 1950.
The reasons now follow.
[15] SP21 testified that he had met with Caroline on 24.10.2010 at
11.30 p.m. in order to return certain belongings of the first accused.
SP21 also said that after this, he was still able to contact Caroline in
2011. Despite this however, after 2011 he had not maintained contact
with Caroline for the next 3 years.
[16] After 3 years had elapsed, in October 2013, SP21 tried to
contact Caroline through her mobile number 012-438 5123 but failed.
9



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

He then went to her last known address at B-12 Taman Free School,
Jalan Terengganu, Pulau Pinang but found an unoccupied house. No
evidence was adduced from any telecommunications company with
respect to the ownership of the mobile phone number 012-438 5123.
After this, there was a hiatus for 1 year until September 2014 when
SP21 decided to advertise in the local daily newspapers as to the
whereabouts of the said Caroline. One advertisement was placed in
the Harian Metro on 4.10.2014 and one in the Star Online web site
dated 30.9.2014.
[17] SP21 also said that he obtained another address from the Inland
Revenue Department under the name of Caroline in Pulau Jerejak,
Penang. Upon checking, this address was also found to be unoccupied.
However, no official correspondence by the Inland Revenue
Department was produced in respect of the address at Pulau Jerejak.
[18] SP21 further testified that he had met up with Caroline’s son
and was informed by him that his mother had moved to Johor.
However, there were no details forthcoming as to the identity of
Caroline’s son, the particulars of the meeting between SP21 and
Caroline’s son, whether a statement was recorded from him nor his
particulars nor contact number. SP21 the said that the last occasion he
attempted to locate Caroline’s whereabouts was in 2014 in
anticipation of securing her presence at the hearing but to no avail.
[19] Now Section 32(1) (i) of the Evidence Act 1950 reads as
follows:
“32. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is
dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant
(1)

Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a
person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has
become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance

10



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense
which under the circumstances of the case appears to the
court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the
following cases:
(i) when the statement was made in the course of, or for
the purposes of, an investigation or inquiry into an
offence under or by virtue of any written law”
[20] It has been held that a person whose whereabouts are unknown
despite a proper search made is a person who “cannot be found”. See
Public Prosecutor v. Lim Bong Kat & Anor [1992] 4 CLJ 2173. The
application of the section is not automatic and sufficient evidence
must be adduced to show that despite all efforts made the person
could not be traced. See DA Duncan v. Public Prosecutor [1980] 2
MLJ 195. The provision in the section was also considered in the case
of Public Prosecutor v. Lee Jun Ho & Ors [2009] 3 MLJ 400 where
the level of diligence expected on the part of the prosecution before
the section could be invoked was stated in no uncertain terms as
follows:
“Section 32 of the Evidence Act 1950 is an exception to the
general rule that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Under s.
32(1) of the Act, one of the circumstances under which such a
statement becomes admissible is where the person who made the
statement ‘cannot be found’. This was the basis upon which the
prosecution tried to invoke when they attempted to produce and
tender ID66 and ID67. For a witness to be clothed as ‘who
cannot be found’ within the meaning of s. 32(1) of the Evidence
Act 1950, such determination is a finding of fact, of which the
onus is upon the prosecution to prove.
From facts adduced, I find that the police has failed to take all
reasonably practicable steps to trace the witnesses. In fact there
11



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

was not a single proactive effort by the police to procure the
attendance of such material, relevant and important eyewitnesses.
There was no attempt to fully utilise the prevailing and
available provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, in order
to secure the attendance of the witnesses. The police failed to
invoke the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code; which
empowers the court to issue a warrant in lieu of or in addition
to summoning a witness and to require that person to execute a
bond for his appearance in court. The police also failed to
invoke the provisions of s. 118(1) of the Criminal Procedure
Code whereby the police officer who desires any person, who is
acquainted with the circumstances of a case, to be present in
court, shall require that person to execute a bond to appear at
the trial court. The prosecution also failed to utilise the
provisions of s. 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code whereby
the public prosecutor may apply to court for any witness of any
sizeable offence that intends to leave Malaysia and that
witness’s presence at the trial to give evidence is fatal for the
trial, to be committed to the civil prison until trial or until he
shall give satisfactory security that he will give evidence at the
trial.
…….
In view of the above circumstances especially of the
omissions by the police to take all reasonably practicable steps
in tracing the witnesses, and guided by the following cases (on
s. 32(1) of the Evidence Act):
(i)

and

(vi) Public Prosecutor v. Norfaizal bin Mat (No 2) [2008] 7
MLJ 792.
I hold that the prosecution has failed to meet the requirements
and the prerequisites of s. 32(1) of the Evidence Act 1950. I
accordingly ruled that the statements, ID66 and ID67 are
inadmissible, as evidence for the prosecution.”
[21] The case makes it clear that the section is an exception to the
hearsay rule and that the onus to prove that a person cannot be found
rests squarely upon the shoulders of the prosecution.
[22] The case of Public Prosecutor v. Mohd Jamil Bin Yahya & Anor
[1993] 3 MLJ 702, held as follows:
“The scope of the first principle may be briefly indicated
by terming it the necessity principle. The person whose assertion
is offered may now be dead, or out of the jurisdiction, or insane,
or otherwise unavailable for the purpose of testing.
The second principle which is termed circumstantial
guarantee of trustworthiness, is in the nature of a practical
substitute for the ordinary test of cross-examination. We see that
under certain circumstances the probability of accuracy and
13



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

trustworthiness of statement is practically sufficient, if not quite
equivalent to that of statements tested in the conventional
manner.”
[23]
In the case of Public Prosecutor v. Michael Anayo Akabogu
[1995] 4 CLJ 79, it was held:
“The scope of the first principle may be briefly indicated
by terming it the necessity principle. The person whose assertion
is offered may now be dead, or out of the jurisdiction, or insane
or otherwise unavailable for the purpose of testing. The second
principle which is termed circumstantial guarantee of
trustworthiness, is in the nature of a practical substitute for the
ordinary test of cross-examination.
We see that under certain circumstances the probability of
accuracy and trustworthiness of statement is practically
sufficient, if not quite equivalent to the statements tested in the
conventional manner.”
[24] Applying the tests above to the facts of the case, the necessity
principle entails asking the question, have the police taken all
necessary steps to ascertain the whereabouts of the maker of the
statement, which in this case is the said Caroline?
[25] There are several measures at the disposal of the prosecution
through the police in securing the presence of important witnesses at
trial. Among these are the following:
a)

Issuing a summons under Section 34(2) of the Criminal
Procedure Code (CPC) or request such a summons through
the court;

14



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

b)

Resort to Section 111(1) CPC in ordering a witness or
potential witness to report to the nearest police station
once a week or fortnightly as the case may be;

c)

Issuance of a warrant to secure the attendance of that
person as required by such order under Section 111(2)
CPC;

d)

Issuance of summons under Section 35 CPC even before
suspects are charged in court;

e)

Affixing a copy of the summons to some conspicuous part
of the house or other place in which the person summoned
ordinarily resides when personal service cannot be effected
under Section 36 CPC;

f)

Issue of warrant of arrest in lieu of or in addition to
summons under Section 47 CPC if the Court has reason to
believe that he has absconded or will not obey the
summons or if at such time he fails to appear and the
summons is proved to have been duly served in time to
admit of his appearing in accordance therewith and no
reasonable excuse is offered for such failure;

g)

Advertising in the local newspapers under Section 118
CPC.

[26] It can be seen at once that apart from advertising as to
information of the whereabouts of Caroline in the newspapers, none
of the other measures were resorted to. In light of the principles
espoused in the authorities on the point alluded to above and
combined with the available provisions under the CPC, I find that the
measures undertaken by the police here are woefully inadequate to
satisfy the necessity principle. That being the case, there was no need

15



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

to go further and consider the circumstantial guarantee of
trustworthiness test, the prosecution having failed at the very first
hurdle. I therefore, as stated earlier, disallowed the application by the
prosecution.
C)

DUTY OF THE COURT AT THE END OF THE
PROSECUTION CASE

[27] Section 180(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) stipulates
that when the case for the prosecution is concluded the Court shall
consider whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie case
against the accused.
[28] The duty of the court at that stage has also been the subject of
judicial consideration in the cases of PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Bin
Ibrahim (No.3) [1999] 2 AMR 2017; [1999] 2 MLJ 1, Looi Kow Chai
&Anor v. PP [2003] 2 AMR 89, Balachandran v. PP [2005] 1 CLJ 85
and PP v. Mohd Radzi Bin Abu Bakar [2005] 6 AMR 203 respectively.
They all adopt the stand that the evidence at the close of the case for
the prosecution must be subjected to maximum evaluation in order to
determine whether a prima facie case is made out that would justify a
court in calling for the defence of the accused.
[29] The phrase “prima facie case” itself has not been statutorily
defined in the above section. However, it has been the subject of
judicial pronouncement. In the case of Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim
(supra), His Lordship Augustine Paul J (as he then was) had this to
say on the meaning of the phrase “prima facie case”:
“The meaning of prima facie case in s. 180(1) of the
Criminal Procedure Code must be understood in the context of a
non-jury trial. A prima facie case arises where the evidence in
favour of a party is sufficiently strong for the opposing party

16



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

to be called on to answer. The evidence adduced must be such
that it can be overthrown only by rebutting evidence by the
other side. Taken in its totality, the force of the evidence must
be such that, if unrebutted, it is sufficient to induce the court
to believe in the existence of the facts stated in the charge or to
consider its existence so probable that a prudent man ought to
act upon the supposition that those facts existed or did happen.
As this exercise cannot be postponed to the end of the trial a
maximum evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses must be
done at the close of the case against the prosecution before the
court can rule that a prima facie case has been made out in
order to call for defence. Be that as it may, I am unable to agree
with the defence submission that this means that the prosecution
must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt at that stage. A
case is said to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt only
upon a consideration and assessment of all the evidence (see
Canadian Criminal Evidence (3rd Ed)….thus, a prima facie
case as prescribed by the new section 180(1) of the Criminal
Procedure Code must mean a case which if unrebutted would
warrant a conviction.” (Emphasis added)
[30] In Looi Kow Chai v. Public Prosecutor [2003] 2 MLJ 65, Gopal
Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) speaking for the Court of Appeal had
this to say:
“It therefore follows that there is only one exercise that a
judge sitting alone under s. 180 of the CPC has to undertake at
the close of the prosecution case. He must subject the
prosecution evidence to maximum evaluation and ask himself the
question: if I decide to call upon the accused to enter his
defence and he elects to remain silent, am I prepared to convict
him on the totality of the evidence contained in the prosecution
case? If the answer is in the negative then no prima facie case
17



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

has been made out and the accused would be entitled to an
acquittal.”
[31] It is therefore evident that the expected standard which a trial
court should hold the prosecution to is that of a maximum evaluation
of the evidence of all their witnesses. This exercise necessarily
involves the court in subjecting all the evidence of the prosecution
witnesses to strict curial scrutiny. The credibility of the testimony of
all the witnesses for the prosecution must be scrutinised and evaluated
with a fine toothcomb. Should more than one inference arise as a
result of this exercise, the one favourable to the accused must be
adopted.

ANALYSIS OF THE PROSECUTION CASE

[32] In order for the prosecution to make out a prima facie case in
respect of the first and second charge against the accused persons, it
is incumbent on them to prove that both accused were in unlawful
possession of the said pistol and the cartridge as per the first charge
and the bullets as per the second charge respectively.
[33] In respect of the third charge, the prosecution has to prove the
following ingredients. Firstly, that the drugs are dangerous drugs
within the meaning and definition of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952
(DDA). Secondly, that the accused was trafficking in the drugs.
[34] In respect of the fourth and fifth charge, the prosecution has to
prove that chloroquine and caffeine are as defined and listed under the
First Schedule to the Poisons Act 1952 and that both accused were in
unlawful possession of the same.
i)

Possession of the pistol, cartridge and bullets

18



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[35] The evidence disclosed that nobody else besides both accused
were present at the premises at the time of the raid. The pistol,
magazine (kelopak) and bullets were also not concealed in a manner
and place that would make it difficult to view if one had wanted to.
These items were also in close proximity to both accused. It was also
in evidence that the pistol, the magazine and bullets were tested by
SP9 and SP11 and found to be serviceable and functioning well. There
was no evidence that any of the accused persons had any permit or
licence to keep the said pistol, magazine and bullets.
[36] This would constitute sufficient evidence to infer that both
accused knew of the whereabouts of these items and therefore it is
safe to make the fair inference that both accused persons had unlawful
possession of the pistol, magazine and the bullets found in the
premises at the time of the raid.
[37] The prosecution had therefore proven a prima facie case against
both accused in respect of the first and second charges.
ii)

The Heroin and Monoacetylmorphines were dangerous drugs
within the meaning and definition of the DDA and the
Caffeine and Chloroquine respectively were as defined and
listed under the First Schedule to the Poisons Act 1952.

[38] SP7, the chemist, testified that there were traces of caffeine on
the walls, floor, electrical fan, gas cylinder, and metal protector found
at the premises. The drug exhibits after analysis, was found to contain
Heroin and Monoacetylmorphines. The chemical substances analysed
turned out to be Chloroquine, Caffeine, Chloroform, and colouring
agents. Also found there were metal basins, wooden stirrers, blenders,
spoons, glass bottles, cups, and a bag containing powdery and
granular substances.

19



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[39] After analysis carried out, SP7 confirmed that the exhibits
analysed were Heroin and Monoacetylmorphines weighing 2,562.9
grams and as listed under the First Schedule to the DDA, while the
2,110 grams Chloroquine, and 89,140 grams of Caffeine were as listed
under the First Schedule to the Poisons Act 1952.
[40] The Federal Court case of Munusamy Vengadasalam v. PP
[1987] CLJ (Rep) 221 held as follows:
“We are therefore of the view, that in this type of cases
where the opinion of the chemist is confined only to the
elementary nature and identity of the substance, the Court is
entitled to accept the opinion of the expert of its face value,
unless it is inherently incredible or the defence calls evidence in
rebuttal by another expert to contradict the opinion. So long as
some credible evidence is given by the chemist to support his
opinion, there is no necessity for him to go into the details of
what he did in the laboratory, step by step.”
[41] I find that the evidence of SP7 was not inherently incredible.
Although a challenge was mounted as the methods of his analysis, in
all the circumstances of the case and guided by the authority referred
to, I find that the prosecution had proven that the drugs seized were of
the type, nature and weight as testified to by PW7 and as confirmed in
the Chemist report, (P87). PW7 had also confirmed that Heroin and
Monoacetylmorphines were as listed under the First Schedule of the
DDA. I therefore accepted the evidence of the Chemist, PW7 as
proving the nature and weight of the drugs.
[42] In respect of the Chloroquine, and Caffeine, SP7 had also
confirmed that they were as listed under the First Schedule to the
Poisons Act 1952. I also accepted the evidence of SP7 in this
respect.
20



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[43] The prosecution had therefore proven the first ingredient in
respect of the third, fourth and fifth charges against the accused
persons.
iii)

The accused persons were in possession of the Heroin and
Monoacetylmorphines and Caffeine and Chloroquine, and were
trafficking in the said Heroin and Monoacetylmorphines

[44] SP7 testified that from the implements and articles found in the
premises, they were being used to conduct a “heroin cutting process”
which was described as a process where drugs containing pure content
was mixed with other chemicals known as “cutting agents” in order to
reduce the purity of content but increase the quantity.
[45] Section 2 defines trafficking as follows:
“trafficking”
includes the doing of any of the following acts, that is to say,
manufacturing, importing, exporting, keeping, concealing,
buying, selling, giving, receiving, storing, administering,
transporting,
carrying,
sending,
delivering,
procuring,
supplying or distributing any dangerous drug otherwise than
under the authority of this Act or the regulations made under the
Act
[46] The word manufacture is defined as follows:
“manufacture”,
in relation to a dangerous drug, includes—
(a)

the making, producing, compounding and assembling of
the drug;

21



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

(b)

the making, producing, compounding and assembling a
preparation of the drug;

(c)

the refining or transformation of the drug into another
dangerous drug; and

(d)

any process done in the course of the foregoing activities;

[47] From the testimony of SP7, the implements and substances
found there would indicate that what was being carried out was
manufacturing as defined under section 2 of the DDA.
[48] As far as possession is concerned, the case of Public Prosecutor
v. Chia Leong Foo [2000] 6 MLJ 705, it was held:
“It must be observed that most of the acts that constitute
‘trafficking’ as defined in s. 2 of the Act like, for example,
keeping, concealing, storing, transporting and carrying
dangerous drugs involve the prerequisite element of possession
unlike, for instance, the sale and supply of dangerous drugs
which need not necessarily involve possession as demonstrated
by Pendakwa Raya v. Mansor bin Mohd Rashid & Anor [1996] 3
MLJ 560. It follows that a person cannot keep, conceal, store,
transport or carry dangerous drugs within the meaning of
‘trafficking’ in the Act without being in possession of them.
Proof of further facts to establish any one of these acts is
therefore sufficient to make out a case of trafficking.”
[49] In Azhar Lazim v. PP [2012] 1 LNS 262, it was held:
“There are eighteen different acts stipulated in s. 2 of the
DDA that constitute the offence of trafficking. And before the
“trafficking” definition of s. 2 of the DDA can be invoked, the
prosecution must prove possession of the dangerous drugs by
the appellant. Here, the High Court rightly held that the
22



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

appellant had exclusive possession of the cannabis in question.
In short, the appellant cannot be said to sell, transport or
distribute the dangerous drugs within the meaning of the word
"trafficking" in s. 2 of the DDA unless the appellant was in
possession of the dangerous drugs. In our judgment, it is
sufficient to prove one of the acts in s. 2 of the DDA to make out
a case of trafficking against the appellant.”
[50] However with respect to manufacturing, in the case of Lee Boon
Siah & Ors v. PP [2014] 3 CLJ 584, it was held:
“For the proper determination of this issue, it must be
borne in mind that, as stated in s. 2 of the DDA, the term
‘manufacture’ includes numerous and diverse processes or
procedures
namely
making,
producing,
compounding,
assembling, refining or transformation of the offending drugs.
For that reason, in our judgment, unlike for example the act of
keeping, concealing, storing, transporting and carrying
dangerous drugs which constitute ‘trafficking’ as defined in s. 2
of the DDA that involve the requirement of possession, the
manufacturing of dangerous drugs as in the present case does
not involve possession (see: PP v. Chia Leong Foo [2000] 4 CLJ
649; [2000] 6 MLJ 705 and Public Prosecutor v. Mansur Md
Rashid & Anor [1997] 1 CLJ 233; [1996] 3 MLJ 560). In other
words, possession of the impugned drugs need not be proven in
a case involving ‘manufacturing’ before the trafficking
definition in s. 2 of the DDA can be invoked.”
[51] From a distillation of the above-mentioned authorities, unlike
those cases which involve the act of keeping, concealing, storing,
transporting and carrying dangerous drugs which constitute
‘trafficking’ as defined in s. 2 of the DDA that involve the
requirement of possession, in the case of manufacturing under section

23



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

2, it is unnecessary for the prosecution to prove possession. In any
event, possession could be inferred from the circumstances of the
case.
[52] What is evident from the facts of the case, was that there was no
one else besides both accused who were in the premises at the time of
the raid by the police. The prosecution evidence also indicated that
there ensued a scuffle before both accused were arrested by the police.
[53] The exhibits including the drugs, other chemical and substances
and the pistol and ammunition were exposed and would have been
fairly visible to both accused. SP7 testified that there emanated a
strong odour from the master bedroom where the implements and
equipment employed in manufacturing drugs and substances were
found. This would not have escaped the olfactory senses of anyone the
premises in a situation where the doors were opened.
[54] Both accused according to the evidence of prosecution witnesses
were also said to be involved in the act of manufacturing with the
second accused mixing some powdery like substance in a basin while
the first accused was standing near to him.
[55] Under all the circumstances therefore, I find that the prosecution
has proved that both accused were in possession of the Heroin and
Monoacetylmorphines and Caffeine and Chloroquine respectively, and
were trafficking in the said Heroin and Monoacetylmorphines.
iv)

Common intention pursuant to section 34 Penal Code

[56] Section 34 of the Penal Code reads as follows:
34.
Each of several persons liable for an act done by all,
in like manner as if done by him alone.

24



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

When a criminal act is done by several persons, in
furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such
persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the
act were done by him alone.
[57] In Mohd Shamsul bin Abdul Aziz @ Abdul Azis v. Public
Prosecutor and another appeal [2016] 3 MLJ 215, it was held:
“[21] The notion behind this provision as contained under
s. 34 of the Penal Code has been a subject of much
deliberation both, by the numerous learned judges in their
reported decisions as well as by learned commentators in
their authoritative books, on the subject of common intention
and what it entails.
[22]
In the case of Mahboob Shah v. Emperor AIR 1945
PC 118 the Law Lords in the Privy Council had this to say
when dealing with an appeal where s. 34 of the Penal Code
was invoked, in aid by the prosecution: ‘ …To invoke the aid
of s. 34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act
complained against was done by one of the accused persons
in the furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is
shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any of
the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by
him alone’. Their Lordships then went on to state the need to
establish that there was a prearranged plan among all of the
accused persons to commit the crime. Once that is
established, then any act by any of them is done in
furtherance of their common intention. The act would
translate into the execution of the common intention.
[23]
In the case of Shaiful Edham bin Adam & Anor v.
Public Prosecutor [1999] 2 SLR 57 it was ruled that ‘... the

25



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

plan could develop on the spot. What was enquired was a
meeting of the minds or acting in concert’.
[24]
The learned authors of Ratanlal and Dhirajlal on
The Indian Penal Code (34th Ed) at p 51 have this to say on
the workings of s. 34 of the Penal Code:
The essence of the liability is to be found in the existence of a
common intention animating the accused leading to the doing
of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. It must be
shown that the criminal act complained against was done by
one of the accused persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime
may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same
manner as if the act were done by him alone.
[25]
As such, to our mind, once common intention is
shown to exist, thereby connoting a prearranged plan among
the accused persons, then, any act however small done by any
one of them, as long as it is done in furtherance of a common
intention, he is liable for the offence, as if the offence is
committed by him alone. That is the process under s. 34 of the
Penal Code in order to determine liability of persons acting
in furtherance of a common intention. The issue of whether
an accused person is a primary or a secondary participant on
account of his degree of participation in the commission of
the offence does not, with respect, arise at all in such
determination. All of them are equally as guilty as long as
they contribute acts which are done in furtherance of their
common intention. In that regard, it must be reiterated that
common intention has been established to have existed among
them. Once that pre-condition is fulfilled, then any act done
by any of them in furtherance of that common intention, is

26



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

deemed as ‘shared’ among them. If at all, the different
degrees of participation among the accused persons may be
considered by the court, in passing sentence, if they are found
guilty and are convicted by the court. In other words, it may
be relevant in mitigation. But in terms of attaching liability, a
consideration of the degree of participation by the various
accused persons in the commission of the offence, with
respect, ought not to happen.
[58]
In Sahri Tahe v. Public Prosecutor and other appeals [2016]
4 MLJ 69, the court of appeal in expounding on section 34 held:
“The section is intended to make a person liable for the
commission of an offence not committed by him, but by another
person with whom he shared the common intention. It is also to
deal with cases in which it is difficult to prove exactly what part
was played by each of them in the commission of the offence or
in cases where it is difficult to distinguish between acts of
individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the
common intention of all – see Hari Ram v. State of Uttar
Pradesh (2004) 3 LRI 523 (SC).”
[59] The evidence here disclosed that at the time of the raid, both
accused were at the scene the premises. Besides them, no one else was
there. The evidence also disclosed that the second accused was mixing
a substance in a basin while the first accused was standing close by
and watching.
[60] Several implements and processing equipment for drugs and
other substances were also visibly exposed. The pistol, cartridge and
the bullets were also in close proximity to the accused. In light of the
above, it can be inferred that there was a prior meeting of minds
between both accused persons to meet at the said premises for the

27



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

purpose as disclosed by the prosecution evidence and therefore
common intention has been proven by the prosecution.
v)

Break in the chain of exhibits

[61] The defence during the course of submissions at the end of the
prosecution case submitted that there was a break in the chain of
exhibits. The defence submitted that there has been a mix up in the
samples. They submitted that according to exhibit P109, samples
“D1” and “D2” was listed as samples obtained from the second
accused. However, according to the evidence of SP21, it was stated
that “D1” and “D2” are envelopes containing the blood and hair
samples belonging to the first accused instead. In addition, in form
Pol 31 (P107), samples “D1” and “D2” were listed as belonging to the
first accused and not the second accused, contrary to what was stated
in P109.
[62] Notwithstanding this, SP8, the government chemist had
positively identified P102 and P102a containing these exhibits in
court as belonging to the second accused and this evidence had not
been challenged by the defence. In any event, in light of the direct
evidence that placed both accused in the premises on the day of the
raid, any possible mix up in the exhibits, if at all there were, would
not prejudice the prosecution case as these exhibits serve to merely
confirm the presence of both accused at the premises that day.
[63] The defence further contended that there was a huge and
material discrepancy in the weight of the exhibits. They submitted
that according to P146 at page 3 a white plastic gunnysack containing
white powdery substance marked as E27 weighs 17,286 grams.
However in P87 at page 7, the same gunnysack marked as A27
contained white powdery substance weighing 1,730 grams. They

28



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

therefore submitted that this is a huge and material discrepancy of
15,556 grams.
[64] The defence also submitted that according to P146 at page 1, a
plastic package containing white powdery substance suspected to be
drugs and marked as E5 weighs 11,160 grams whereas in P87 the
same plastic package marked as A5 contained white powdery
substance weighing 1,280 grams. There was thus a huge material
discrepancy of 9,880 grams. The inference to be drawn from the
above material discrepancies, they submitted, was that the drugs
analysed by the chemist were not the same drugs seized during the
raid.
[65] SP21, the investigating officer testified during re-examination
that with respect to the difference in the weight of the drugs, in
respect of the items as listed in P146, he saw Inspector Gan, (SP17),
use a digital weighing scale to weigh P146 from which he obtained
the gross weight. SP21 testified that with regard to exhibit P87
(chemist report) and its contents, the weight stated therein was
obviously the nett weights derived by the chemist. A perusal of P146
indicate that the weights obtained are gross weights from the use of
the phrase “keseluruhan”.
[66] The difference between the digital weighing scale used by SP17
to obtain the gross weight and the weighing instruments used by the
chemist which must have been calibrated in all probability to obtain
the nett weights, would sufficiently account for the discrepancies in
the weight of the exhibits. There was no evidence that the weighing
scale used by SP17 had been calibrated. In this regard there was
therefore an explanation advanced during the course of the
prosecution case to explain such discrepancies and I accept the
explanation.

29



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[67] The case of Hasbala Mohd Sarong v. Public Prosecutor [2013] 6
CLJ 945, had held that a difference in weight, on its own, is no
sufficient ground to hold that there were doubts with regard to the
identity of the drugs. In Lew Wai Loon v. Public Prosecutor [2014] 2
CLJ 649, it was held that discrepancies in weight alone should not
ipso facto cast doubt on the identity of the exhibits. In Lew Wai Loon
v. Public Prosecutor the case of Zaifull Muhammad v. PP & Another
Appeal [2013] 2 CLJ 383, was distinguished on the ground that there
no explanation was available, offered or could be inferred from the
facts and circumstances available as to the discrepancies in the weight
of the drugs. Under the circumstances therefore, I find that the
difference in the weight of the drugs ipso facto does not cast any
doubt as to the identity of the exhibits in this case.
[68] With regard to the non-production of the 100 plus tin canned
drink from which a swab was taken said to contain the DNA of the
second accused, again I find that this omission does not prejudice the
case for the prosecution in view of the direct evidence that the second
accused was in the premises at the time of the raid. In any event, this
piece of evidence was only to confirm the presence of the second
accused at the premises at the time of the raid and is therefore merely
corroborative in nature.
vi)

Non calling of the laboratory assistants

[69] The defence further raised the fact that from the evidence, the
chemist (SP7) was assisted by laboratory assistants in the course of
her analysis and the fact that these officers were not called was fatal
to the prosecution.
[70] In Public Prosecutor v. Abuchi Ben James [2015] 8 CLJ 1011,
cited by learned counsel for the accused, the sole determination for
the court was whether the nature of the drugs and the weight as stated
30



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

in the charge had been proven by the prosecution. It was the
testimony of the chemist that she had the assistance of two science
officers. The methodology adopted was that the two officers would
accept samples from the chemist and place them in the GCMS and the
GCFID machine respectively.
[71] The samples were put in several vials and the results were in the
form of computer print outs. The chemist admitted that during the
time the vials were in the equipment she was not present. The High
Court held that it was pertinent for the prosecution to prove that the
equipment was in proper working order and properly calibrated.
[72] It also held that the final findings as to the nature and weight of
the drugs were dependent on the accuracy of the results produced by
the equipment. In the premises it was held that the non-calling of the
two officers were fatal and the accused was accordingly acquitted
without his defence being called. The Court of Appeal found that from
the evidence adduced, the High Court was correct in acquitting the
accused without calling for defence. The reason given by the Court of
Appeal was that as only the print out from the machines was given to
the chemist, there remained a doubt whether the analysis was done by
the science officers or by the chemist.
[73] However, it is also in evidence in the instant case that SP7
testified that although the laboratory assistants assisted her in the
analysis of the GCMS and GCFID, it was under her supervision. SP7
also testified that it was she who had interpreted the results of the
analysis.
[74] There has been a consistent trend of cases since the Supreme
Court case of Munusamy v. Public Prosecutor [1987] 1 MLJ 492, that
the court is entitled to accept the evidence of the chemist at face value
unless it is inherently incredible. It was held there as follows:

31



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

“…..in this type of cases where the opinion of the Chemist
is confined only to the elementary nature and identity of the
substance, the court is entitled to accept the opinion of the
expert on its face value, unless it is inherently incredible or the
defence calls evidence in rebuttal by another expert to
contradict the opinion. So long as some credible evidence is
given by the Chemist to support his opinion, there is no
necessity for him to go into details of what he did in the
laboratory, step by step;”
[75]
held:

In Public Prosecutor v. Lam San [1991] 3 MLJ 426, it was

“….. that in regard to the evidence of the chemist, unless
the evidence is so inherently incredible that no reasonable
person can believe it to be true, it should be accepted as prima
facie evidence. As long as the evidence is credible, there is no
necessity for the chemist to show in detail what he did in his
laboratory.”
[76]
In the Court of Appeal case of Ilham Saputra bin Zainal
Abidin v. Public Prosecutor[2014] 3 MLJ 419, it was held:
“[5] On the issue of the identity of the drugs, the crux of the
submission is based on the fact that the chemist (PW2) was
assisted by one Sabri. It was argued by counsel that since the
drugs were not analysed by the chemist, the chemist will not be
in a position to identify the drugs. In support for her contention,
learned counsel relied on the authority of Khoo Hi Chiang v.
Public Prosecutor and another appeal [1994] 1 MLJ 265;
[1992] 1 LNS 318.

[7] It is trite law that identification of drugs is a question of
fact, which like any other conclusion of fact, can either be by
direct or circumstantial evidence. A chemist will be able to
identify the drugs by conducting various tests and observing the
result. In this case, the chemist conducted the test and observed
the result and concluded by identifying the type and nature of
the drugs. The chemist’s evidence can be seen at p 8 of the
appeal records, which reads as follows:

Setelah dikira peratusan tersebut berdasarkan berat bersih

[78] The cases emanating from the apex court above including the
Court of Appeal decision in Ilham Saputra and the decision of the
apex court in Khoo Hi Chiang v. Public Prosecutor [1994] 1 MLJ 265
to similar effect were not brought to the attention of the Court of
Appeal in Abuche’s case and the result might well have been different
if it had. This court is bound by the aforementioned decisions of the
apex court. Unless the evidence shows that there has been a break in
the chain of exhibits as a result of the handling of the exhibits by
these officers, I find that it was not incumbent upon the prosecution to
call each and everyone involved in the handling of the exhibits as
witnesses. On the facts, I do not find that there has been any such
break in the chain of exhibits and therefore the failure to call the
officers did not cause any infirmity nor did it result in a gap in the
prosecution case in that regard or result in the necessity to invoke
section 114(g) Evidence Act 1950 against the prosecution. See

Non-calling of Vincent Iskandar Shah

[79] Despite the persuasion of counsel for both accused to invoke the
adverse presumption under section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act 1950
for the non-calling of the said Vincent, I declined to do so. The reason
being that SP21 had testified that he had made attempts to locate the
said Vincent without success. Furthermore, exhibits P143 and P145
were handed over to the defence before the commencement of the
trial. Under all the circumstances therefore, I did not find any element
of withholding or suppression of evidence on the part of the
prosecution as to the calling of the said Vincent. See Munusamy v.
Public Prosecutor [1987] 1 MLJ 492.
[80] Based upon all of the foregoing, I therefore find that the
prosecution had succeeded in proving a prime facie case against both

accused persons in respect of all five charges and I accordingly
ordered them to enter their defence.
[81] After all the alternatives consequent upon such finding was
informed to both accused persons, they elected to give evidence on oath.
E)

DEFENCE CASE

[82] The defence of both accused essentially was that their presence
at the premises at the time of the raid was at the invitation of one
Vincent Iskandar Shah and that they happened to be there for the
purpose of certain works which the said Vincent had requested them
to do.
[83] The first accused gave evidence that at the time of the arrest, he
was residing at B12 Taman Free School Flats, George Town with his
wife and two sons. His wife’s name is Caroline a/p Patrick. He works
as a contractor doing renovation work, buying and selling scrap and
does cleaning jobs. The first accused had registered a company at the
end of 2008 called Somasundram Enterprise and at the time he was its
sole owner.
[84] In 2010, he had transferred the ownership of the company to his
wife and ceased being the owner from 21.7.2010. The new owner was
Caroline a/p Patrick. He said that from then on he had no dealings
with the company and did not have the power to sign any cheques. He
denied that he had instructed Caroline a/p Patrick to issue any
cheques. He denied any knowledge of the photocopy of the Maybank
cheque exhibit (P144).
[85] The first accused said that he did not rent the premises at Unit
No. 1-03-09 Spring Condominium. After he left Somasundram
Enterprise he operated on his own in performing the works described
above.
36



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[86] The first accused testified that on 21.10.2010, he received a
phone call from someone who introduced himself as Vincent. The said
Vincent told him that he had rented the premises and that he required
the first accused to do some wiring and cleaning work in the premises.
The first accused told him that he could perform the cleaning work
but not the wiring work. The first accused told him that his friend
named Yoga (second accused) could do the wiring works. An
appointment was made to meet at the Spring Condominium the next
day at around 10.30 a.m.
[87] According to the first accused the said Vincent asked him to
bring Yoga with him and after he ended his conversation with
Vincent, he called Yoga and the latter said he was free. The next day
i.e. 22.10.2010 around 10.30 a.m. the first accused went to the guard
house at the said condominium and Vincent arrived in a white Proton
car and told him to go to the premises and that he would inform the
guard to let him in.
[88] Vincent drove his car into the car park as the first accused
proceeded in the direction he was shown and along the way he met
Yoga. Vincent then came to them and introduced himself. Both the
first accused and the second accused (Yoga) followed Vincent into the
premises. Once they entered Vincent switched on the light and fan and
told them it is not functioning. He also said that he required some
cleaning works to be done. He told the second accused that he wanted
to install additional power points and two lighting points in the living
room.
[89] Vincent then received a phone call and proceeded some distance
away from them to conduct his tele conversation. Vincent then asked
both accused to provide their quotes for the work. Vincent then said
that he wanted to go out to buy some food for himself and the
accused. Both accused replied that they did not want any food but

37



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

would only want some drinks. After that, Vincent told the accused
that he would be back and he went out and closed the door.
[90] According to the first accused, after Vincent left, the second
accused carried out checks on why the light was not functioning. The
first accused said that the lights and fan that the second accused was
checking was located in the living room. The first accused testified
that the doors to the rooms were closed and he and the second accused
did not know what were in the rooms. The first accused said that as
the second accused was taking some measurements for an extra power
point, they heard a loud bang on the door. They took a few steps
towards the door when the door broke open and they saw a lot of
people wearing masks with guns and laser lights who shouted to them
not to move.
[91] They were then arrested and assaulted by these persons.
According to the first accused, the men who they later learned were
police brought in one male and one female Malay. The female was a
security guard while the male was a person to whom he had given his
NRIC to. Both these persons told the police that they did not know
him while they said that they knew the second accused. The first
accused denied any involvement with the drugs and ammunition found
the premises.
[92] He also said that he had no keys or access card to the premises.
He also denied any knowledge of the Tenancy Agreement (P142). He
said that Vincent did not inform him what kind of cleaning services he
wanted him to perform. He said that he was not told whether to clean
the whole premises or merely to just clean the living room.
[93] The first accused said that they waited in the living room of the
premises after Vincent had left to buy some food and drinks. The first
accused said that Vincent had offered to buy him and the second
accused some food but they refused the offer except that they agreed
38



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

to Vincent buying them some drinks. During cross examination, the
first accused testified that on the day of the incident, he did not bring
any tools with him to the premises as he was only there to provide a
quote for the work to be done.
[94]
The second accused testified that he was staying at the Spring
Condominium at 1-19-03 with his wife and child. He said that he
worked as an electrician. The second accused testified that he was
requested by the first accused to do wiring works at the said premises
to which he agreed.
[95]
He met with the first accused in the morning of 22.10.2010.
He brought some tools with him including a test pen, screwdriver,
plier, cutter and measuring tape. The first accused introduced him to a
male Indian and the first accused told the male Indian that he would
be doing the wiring work. This male Indian was Vincent.
[96]
The second accused then followed the said Vincent together
with the first accused into the said premises. The rest of the evidence
given by the second accused to a large extent mirrored that of the first
accused.
[97]
The second accused said that day was the first time that he
had been to the premises. The second accused also testified that he
went there that day to provide a quotation only and that he had not
brought any tools to do wiring works.
[98]
Both the accused denied that they were at the premises for the
purpose of manufacturing drugs. They said that the premises belonged
to Vincent and their presence at the premises during the time of the
raid was because they had gone there to either do certain work at the
request of Vincent or to provide a quotation for the works requested
by Vincent. They denied any connection to the premises.

DUTY OF THE COURT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE
TRIAL

[99] The duty of a trial court at the conclusion of the defence case is
set out in section 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code which reads
as follows:
182 A - Procedure at the conclusion of the trial
(1)

At the conclusion of the trial, the Court shall consider all
the evidence adduced before it and shall decide whether
the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable
doubt.

[100] In Md Zainudin bin Raujan v. Public Prosecutor [2013] 3 MLJ
773, the Federal Court observed as follows:
“At the conclusion of the trial, s. 182A of the Criminal
Procedure Code imposes a duty on the trial court to consider all
the evidence adduced before it and to decide whether the
prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The
defence of the accused must be considered in the totality of the
evidence adduced by the prosecution, as well as in the light of
the well - established principles enunciated in Mat v. Public
Prosecutor [1963] 1 MLJ 263 with regard to the approach to be
taken in evaluating the evidence of the defence.”
[101] In Prasit Punyang v. Public Prosecutor [2014] 4 MLJ 282, it
was held the emphasis must be on the word “all” employed in section
182A, CPC.
[102] What amounts to a “reasonable doubt “itself is not defined in
section 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, in Public
Prosecutor v. Saimin [1971]2 MLJ 16, it was held by Sharma J that:

40



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

“It is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating
to human affairs and depending upon moral evidence is open to
some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case
which after the entire comparison and consideration of all the
evidence leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that
they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction to a moral
certainty of the truth of the charge.”
[103] Aside from the above, the correct thought process and stages
that should be followed by a trial court in the assessment and
evaluation of the defence evidence is that as encapsulated in the time
honoured decision of Mat v. Public Prosecutor 1963 29 MLJ 263,
where it was held by Suffian J (as he then was) as follows:
“The position may be conveniently stated as follows:–
(a) If you are satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt as to the accused’s guiltConvict.
(b) If you accept or believe the accused’s
explanation

Acquit.

(c) If you do not accept or believe the accused’s
explanation
Do not convict
but consider the
next steps below.
(d) If you do not accept or believe the accused’s
explanation and that explanation does not raise in
your mind a reasonable doubt as to his guilt
Convict.
(e) If you do not accept or believe the accused’s
explanation but nevertheless it raises in your
mind a reasonable doubt as to his guilt
Acquit.”
41



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

[104] The approach in Mat v. Public Prosecutor was judicially
endorsed by the Federal Court as being the correct one to adopt when
evaluating the evidence of the defence case in Public Prosecutor v.
Mohd Radzi Bin Abu Bakar [2005] 6 MLJ 393.
G)

ANALYSIS OF DEFENCE CASE

[105] Apart from the duty imposed by a trial court at the conclusion of
the whole case as described already, a trial court must carry out a
maximum re-evaluation of the prosecution’s case but this time
considered and tested as against the sworn evidence given by the
accused. This was of course, something that was not possible to do at
the close of the prosecution case.
[106] In Public Prosecutor v. Iskandar bin Mohamad Yusof [2006] 5
MLJ 559, it was held by Suriyadi J (as he then was):
“[10] As said above when I called the defence I was satisfied
that a prima facie case had successfully been established by the
prosecution. Factually and legally the prosecution had satisfied
all the ingredients and requirements of s. 180 of the Criminal
Procedure Code. Before arriving at that conclusion as required
by the latter section, and as stated earlier, a maximum
evaluation of the evidence was conducted by me. Needless to say
that evaluation was totally one sided, in that it was substantially
the evidence adduced by the prosecution, though peppered by
the accused person’s suggestions and answers elicited from
witnesses in the course of the cross examination. Naturally, at
that stage, no sworn testimony of the accused person was made
available that could prematurely punch holes in the
prosecution’s story. Naturally too, whatever was suggested by
the accused person that could be helpful to him inevitably would

42



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

receive unhelpful answers. With such a scenario,
prosecution literally sauntered into the defence stage.

the

[11] At the defence stage, a different scenario expressed itself.
The prosecution’s story had to be re-evaluated maximum-like,
but this time padded by the additional defence’s version, which
was given under oath. At the end of the accused person’s case,
unless the prosecution succeeded at convincing me beyond
reasonable doubt, he must be acquitted. All the latter needed to
do was to weaken the prosecution’s case on a balance of
probability.” (emphasis added)
[107] The main plank of the defence led by both accused is that the
premises where they were found in at the time of the raid on
22.10.2012, belonged to someone by the name of Vincent Iskandar
Shah (“Vincent”). Their defence therefore by way of extension is that
the drug exhibits and the pistol and ammunition found in the premises
do not belong to them but may have belonged instead to the said
Vincent.
[108] In the evaluation of the defence case, it is also important to
consider whether the version given is an afterthought or plain and
deliberate lies. In so doing the court must consider whether the
version as contended for by the defence with respect to matters
material to their defence are raised for the first time during the
defence case thus leaving the prosecution witnesses no opportunity of
either admitting or denying the same or whether the defence version
was put during the course of the prosecution case itself.
[109] The practice of raising matters or putting one’s case during the
prosecution case whether arising out of matters contained in the
cautioned statement or otherwise is commonly referred to as the
Alcontara Notice. The “Alcontara Notice” is the furnishing of details
in support of an accused’s defence which is normally given in his or
43



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

her cautioned statement. It must be borne in mind however, that this
may or may not involve the actual tendering of the cautioned
statement itself in evidence. Even if the cautioned statement was not
tendered, the court must nevertheless consider such version as put
during the course of the prosecution case. Once such a notice is given,
investigation must be carried out on the disclosure given and the onus
is then shifted to the prosecution to rebut the “Alcontara Notice”.
[110] The shifting of the burden however, to the prosecution after the
giving of the “Alcontara Notice”, as of necessity presupposes that
sufficient particulars or reasonable details are furnished in order for
the police to carry out a meaningful investigation in respect of the
information. Therefore, should the details furnished be insufficient,
that will amount to an insufficient “Alcontara Notice”. In those
circumstances, the burden cannot be then said to shift to the
prosecution to rebut the notice. Whether the disclosure is sufficient is
a question of fact to be gathered from the evidence.
[111] It is apposite to now consider the evidence led by both accused
in order to evaluate whether their evidence can be so categorised as
afterthoughts or deliberate lies. It is also necessary to sift through the
evidence in particular to consider whether the personality of the said
Vincent Iskandar Shah was a mere invention or whose identity was
deliberately used in order to escape culpability.
[112] Further, from the nature of the defence raised here, the court
also have regard for what is known as the “Radhi Direction”. This is
so because the defence has contended that the said premises belong to
a Vincent Iskandar Shah and therefore it is he that is the real
trafficker in this case.
[113] The “Radhi Direction” is so named after the case bearing its
name cited as Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP [1991] 3 CLJ 2073. The

44



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

“Radhi direction” was explained by Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then
was) in the case of Yee Wen Chin v. PP [2008] 6 CLJ 773 as follows:
“[12] The section is relevant to the present case in the following
way. In the course of cross-examining the prosecution witnesses
it was extracted from PW5 that the information he had received
was that Woo Kok Meng was trafficking in drugs at the place in
question. The defence quite properly took advantage of this fact
to demonstrate that Woo was the real trafficker and that the
accused was entirely innocent. The accused was clearly entitled
to do this in view of the decision in Mohamad Radhi v. Public
Prosecutor [1991] 3 CLJ 2073; [1991] 1 CLJ (Rep) 311 SC.
That case is authority for the proposition that a person
charged with trafficking is entitled to an acquittal on that
charge by showing that he was a mere possessor of the drugs
whilst another was the true trafficker. Whenever such a
defence is taken two separate exercises must be carried out by
the trial judge. He must first determine as a fact whether that
other is a real person or a mere figment of the accused’s
imagination invented for the purpose of the trial. Next, if he
finds that other person to be real the judge must then
determine whether that other person is the real trafficker. This
is called the Radhi direction and must be administered by a
court unto itself when such a defence is taken. See, Sochima
Okoye v. Public Prosecutor [1995] 3 CLJ 371 CA.” (emphasis
added)
[114] With some modifications (as the accused are not contending that
they are mere possessors), the said “Radhi Direction” as alluded to
assumes relevancy here for reason that the defence contended that
they were mere invitees to the premises at the invitation of Vincent.
To support this, the defence alluded to a tenancy agreement (P142)
together with a copy of a National Registration Identity Card (NRIC)
45



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

(P143) in the name of the said Vincent which was tendered in
evidence by the prosecution during their case. The defence therefore
submitted that this provided evidence that the said premises were in
fact occupied by the said Vincent and that the drug exhibits and the
pistol together with the ammunition that formed the subject matter of
the charges against them in fact belonged to Vincent.
[115] As against this, the prosecution relied upon the evidence of two
witnesses, namely, SP15 who was the landlord of the premises and
SP16 who was in charge of maintenance at the condominium and the
middleman involved who transacted on behalf of the landlord (SP16)
in respect of tenants. SP15 testified that SP16 had brought a lady to
meet him. He could not remember this lady’s name. SP15 said that
SP16 told him that the lady wanted to rent the premises.
[116] SP15 himself prepared three copies of a tenancy agreement in
the name of Vincent Iskandar Shah to that end which he handed to
SP16. He got the NRIC of Vincent from SP16. He said that the
monthly rental was RM1,500.00 He said he took RM3,500.00 as
deposit. He said initially he also received a CIMB cheque (ID144) for
RM3,500.00 from SP16. He did not know who made out the cheque.
He said that he handed 4 sets of keys to SP16. He did not know both
accused. He does not know who occupies the premises or who signed
the cheque.
[117] SP16 on the other hand testified that a male Indian by the name
of Mr Soma whom he met twice wanted to rent the premises. He
identified Mr Soma who he had met as the first accused. More
interestingly, he said that he meet with Soma together with SP15.
After introducing Soma to SP15, he said SP15 agreed to rent the
premises. He also said that Mr Soma had made payment to SP15.
SP16 said that SP15 met the said Mr Soma while in his presence
once.

46



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[118] The prosecution contended that the said Mr Soma was the first
accused. This therefore proved that it was the first accused who had
rented the said premises. SP16 had also identified the first accused at
an identification parade.
[119] The defence however, alluded to what they described as material
contradictions between the evidence of SP15 and SP16 which
demolish the prosecution contention. They submitted that while SP16
had said that SP15 had met with the first accused, SP15 himself said
that he had never met the first accused. SP15 only remembers having
met a lady. SP16 also denied receiving copies of the tenancy
agreement said to have been given to him by SP15. Further, while
SP16 said that SP15 handed the access card to the premises to the first
accused, SP15 denied having met the first accused.
[120] Several questions arise as a result of the above testimony. Did
the first accused rent the premises from SP15 or could it possibly
have been someone else? If SP15 is to be believed, there is no
evidence that the first accused rented the premises and had the access
card to the premises and therefore could not have had access to the
premises. If SP16 is to be believed, then there is evidence that the
first accused rented the premises.
[121] In the light of this contradiction, this court is necessarily
confronted with two pieces of conflicting evidence from the
prosecution evidence. This contradiction was never explained by the
prosecution save for a submission that perhaps due to the lapse of the
intervening time, SP15 may have forgotten that he had met the first
accused.
[122] As against this, is the evidence of both accused that the premises
were occupied by Vincent and that they were only there for purposes
of work related matters at the invitation of Vincent. In the face of two
possible versions, it is trite that any resulting benefit must be resolved
47



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

in favour of the accused persons. No doubt, it was given in evidence
that SP16 had identified the first accused at an identification parade.
[123] As against this is the evidence by way of admission from the
officer who conducted the parade (SP13) that the parade was wrongly
conducted, contrary to procedure as being in contravention of the
Inspector General of Police Standing Orders (IGPSO) and therefore
unfair. The defence therefore contends that the said identification
parade was therefore vitiated and no reliance can be placed on it.
[124] Coupled with this is the testimony of SP16 that he was
instructed by the police to identify the first accused by touching his
arm. Two possible inferences arise out of this, the first is that the
police told SP16 that he had to identify the person he met by
physically touching the person, thereby merely indicating the manner
in which proper identification should be done, or that the police had
actually told SP16 to identify the first accused by touching him and
thus had pointed out beforehand the first accused to SP16. As with all
other inferences, any resulting benefit must go the way of the
accused.
[125] SP16 further said that he knew that the second accused was
residing on the 16 th floor as he was part of the management and he
works there. However, SP16 testified that he did not know who stayed
at Unit 1-03-09 (the said premises). Given that SP16 was familiar
with the tenants and occupiers of the condominium, and he did not
testify that the first accused occupied the premises, the benefit of this
must undoubtedly also be resolved in favour of the first accused that
he was not the occupier of the said premises.
[126] The prosecution also contended that payment for the tenancy
was made through a cheque (P144) issued by a Somasundram
Enterprise in an attempt to prove that the first accused had rented the
said premises. The first accused testified that while he was the owner
48



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

of the said entity at one time, he had since registered his withdrawal
from the said entity the reason being that he decided as a result of
some issues of financial misunderstanding with his wife (Caroline
Patrick), to transfer the ownership of the entity to her.
[127] More crucially, at the time the said cheque was issued, the first
accused was no longer the owner of the entity. A Suruhanjaya
Syarikat Malaysia (SSM) search (P196) in respect of the said
Somasundram Enterprise confirmed that on the date the said cheque
was issued, the first accused was no longer the owner of the entity.
The first accused also said that he had never instructed Caroline
Patrick to issue any cheques. The one person of course who could
have confirmed beyond doubt the actual status of the entity was the
said Caroline Patrick who unfortunately was nowhere to be found.
[128] It must also be remembered that SP16 had said that he had
received deposit payments for rental of the premises by way of cash
and not by way of cheque. This raises further doubt as to whether or
not it was the first accused who in fact rented the said premises.
[129] There was also in evidence a motor vehicle (“car”) bearing
registration number PCQ 9676 found in the parking bay reserved for
the tenant of the said premises, which according to a search conducted
at the Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalanraya (JPJ) (P172), was registered in
the name of the said Vincent.
[130] The prosecution submitted that just because the car was
registered in Vincent’s name does not mean that other persons could
not have used the car. In the same vein, it was also argued by them
that the premises did not contain any evidence of Vincent’s
occupancy. It was submitted by the prosecution that from the
photographs produced at the trial, pictures of Hindu deities could be
seen and articles of Hindu worship was also found. This proved that

49



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

the said Vincent, who by his very name indicated that he was of the
Muslim faith could not be staying there.
[131] By the same token, it can also be argued that apart from the
evidence of Hindu worship (which is at best neutral) as it was never
asked during cross examination, of what faith the accused persons
were, there was no evidence of any items to connect the accused
persons to the premises or the said car. No identification documents
linking the accused were found, no personal belongings or
photographs were also found nor was any clothing found in the
premises at the time of the raid to connect either of the accused to the
premises. It was also in evidence that the second accused resided
elsewhere on an upper floor in the said condominium.
[132] Clothings were however curiously discovered in the premises on
27.10.2010 while the raid was conducted on 22.10.2010, some 5 days
after. This anomaly was never explained and neither were there
evidence of any clothes fitting exercise conducted in respect of both
accused. The discovery of the clothes 5 days after also raised the
issue of whether someone else had access to the said premises.
[133] Perhaps the most inexplicable part of the case given the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses, is that the second accused was
seen mixing with his hands (there being no evidence that gloves were
used) some powdery substance while the first accused was standing
next to him.
[134] This forensic part of the case tends to support the version of the
defence and needs to be carefully considered. SP17 testified that when
both accused were arrested, there were traces of powdery substances
on both of the accused person’s body and clothings. It is also not in
dispute that after the arrest of the accused, swabs were taken from the
right and left hands and the fingernails of both accused.

50



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

[135] Curiously though, the results of the analysis of these swabs
revealed in report (PP) FOR 4049/10-5 (P110) were negative.
Therefore contrary to the evidence of SP17, there were in fact no
traces of any drugs or psychotropic substances found on the accused
person’s hands and fingernails.
[136] Further, the clothings of both accused worn by them that day
were also seized and sent to the chemist by way of form Pol 31 (P82)
for analysis of traces of drugs. The results of the analysis based on
chemist report (PP) FOR 4049/10-1 (P84) was again negative for any
traces of drugs or psychotropic substances.
[137] It defies reasonable belief that if the accused were in fact
engaged in the very act of manufacturing drugs as contended by the
prosecution, not a single trace of drugs or similar substances were
detected from their person and clothings. There was no evidence that
the accused were wearing gloves at the time. If as the evidence
revealed, the second accused was mixing a powdery substance with
his bare hands, it is difficult to fathom that there was not a trace of
such substances detected.
[138] This all the more so in light of the fact that traces of drugs were
found on the floor and the walls of the master bedroom. There may
have been an altogether plausible explanation for this anomaly but
none was advanced by the prosecution save for the submission that
the forensic evidence is only corroborative in the light of the direct
evidence given. In a case involving capital punishment, such a
contradiction or anomaly cannot be lightly dismissed without more.
Once again, whatever inferences that may arise from this has to be
resolved in the accused person’s favour. This further tends to support
the version of the accused that they may have in fact been in the
living room for the purpose they testified to when the police raided
the premises.

51

[139] Still on the subject of forensic evidence, there were 4 fingerprint
traces discovered on several items recovered from the master bedroom
namely, a red cover plastic container, a Sunkist box, a blender and a
small plastic container. The outcome of the analysis on these
fingerprints revealed negative results in respect of both accused.
[140] To further exacerbate the case for the prosecution, although they
had obtained a copy of Vincent’s identity card (P172) from the
National Registration Department which also contained his
fingerprint, the prosecution had never bothered to conduct a possible
match with the prints recovered from the said 4 items found in the
master bedroom. This resulted in a failure to exclude the possibility
that the said Vincent might have handled those items and thus raising
the possibility that the accused persons may have been telling the
truth. There was also no evidence of any fingerprints of either of the
accused on the pistol, cartridge or bullets recovered so as to link them
to those items.
[141] Further, the evidence of SP17 was that before the raid, they
conducted an observation on the said premises and observed through the
thinly veiled curtains in the living room what was described as the
silhouettes or shadows of persons moving about in the living room. This
raises the probability that what the accused had said about them waiting
in the living room for Vincent to return, may have well been true or at
the very least have raised doubt in the prosecution’s version.
[142] Although the evidence of SP7 was that a foul smelling odour
emitted from the master bedroom, if the version of the accused
persons that the doors to the rooms at the said premises were closed
were true, this could possibly account for the version of the accused
that they did not detect any such odour. In any event, such doubt in
the two possible versions must favour the accused.

52



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

[143] The second accused had further identified some of the tools
from the photographs he said he had brought with him to the premises
including a measuring tape for the purpose of the work he said
Vincent had asked him to do.
[144] In respect of the efforts made to trace the whereabouts of the
said Vincent, although SP21 admitted that he was an important
witness, the efforts made to locate him were woefully inadequate.
SP21 went to the National Registration Department on 28.10.2010 and
obtained Vincent’s address as per P172. However, SP21 did not
conduct any investigation at the said address. Instead SP21 informed
the Dang Wangi Police Station to investigate Vincent at the said
address.
[145] Other than the fact that SP21 said that the Vincent could not be
found at the address in Klang, there were no details forthcoming as
the results of the investigation. A further feeble attempt was made
some 4 years after the incident to advertise for information as to the
whereabouts of Vincent. The accused ought not to be prejudiced for
the lack of investigation as to the said Vincent who was the principal
player in this episode according to the accused. This omission must
also be resolved against the prosecution and in favour of the accused.
[146] The lack of closed circuit camera television (CCTV) recordings
further does not in any way assist the prosecution in proving the guilt
of both accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution witnesses
had said that there were CCTVs on every floor and yet no attempt was
made to obtain them. It may be that in most situations, lack of CCTV
recordings may only amount to corroborative evidence at best.
However, this is not the case in every situation. In cases where there
exists a divergence in the versions of the prosecution on the one hand,
and the defence, on the other, the importance of CCTV evidence

53



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

cannot be underestimated. See Pang Chee Meng v. PP [1992] 1 CLJ
265 and See Kek Chuan v. PP [2013] 6 CLJ.
[147] The prosecution pointed out several contradictions between the
evidence as put by both accused during the course of the prosecution
case as compared to the evidence given by them during the course of
the defence case. The prosecution contends that these contradictions
are material.
[148] During the course of the prosecution case, it was suggested that
the condominium unit was rented as a homestay while during the
defence case, there was no evidence given that the said unit was a
homestay. It was suggested during the prosecution case that the said
Vincent had asked both accused to move some things into the unit on
the day of the incident whereas during the defence case evidence was
led that Vincent has asked the accused persons to perform cleaning
works and electrical wiring works at the unit.
[149] During the prosecution case, it was suggested that both the
accused told the police that they were waiting for Vincent to have a
meal with him whereas during the defence case, the evidence was that
Vincent had offered to buy food but both accused had turned down the
offer and only asked for a drink instead.
[150] A further contradiction submitted the prosecution, was that
during the prosecution case, it was suggested that the second accused
told the police that he was at the said unit as he had been invited for a
meal whereas during the defence case, the second accused testified
that he was asked by the first accused to go to the unit to do wiring
work. The second accused had also refused Vincent’s offer to buy
food for him.
[151] In the course of the prosecution case, it was put that this was not
the first occasion that the second accused had been to the unit but had

54



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

been there one to two days before the day of the incident to do
electrical works. In contrast, during the defence case, evidence was
however led by the second accused that the day of the incident was
the first occasion he had been to the unit.
[152] Notwithstanding the apparent contradictions as submitted by the
prosecution, it is evident that the essence of the defence case was that
they were there at the invitation of Vincent when the raid occurred.
The possibility that Vincent was occupying the premises cannot in
light of the evidence considered above be altogether discounted. It
must also be remembered that on the available evidence, the
involvement of Vincent as the tenant and occupier of the premises
were not altogether excluded by the prosecution.
[153] Therefore whether the accused had said they were there in order
to merely provide a quotation or actually do the work and the other
matters highlighted by the prosecution, cannot be considered material
in light of the other evidence establishing the possibility of Vincent
being the occupier of the premises. This is further supported by the
damning lack of forensic evidence to link both accused to the
incriminating exhibits.
[154] Upon considering the manner in which the defence case was
conducted right from the prosecution case itself, it is evident that they
had contended that the said Vincent was not a figment of their
imagination but a real person and the one who occupied the premises.
The defence version was put to several prosecution witnesses during
the course of the prosecution stage. Coupled with their sworn
evidence, I find that the defence had given a sufficient “Alcontara
Notice” which the prosecution has failed to rebut.
[155] I also find that upon application of the “Radhi Direction”,
Vincent was not a fictitious person, as also admitted to by prosecution
witnesses, and that his involvement as the true trafficker in this case
55



[2016] 1 LNS 1067

Legal Network Series

has not been altogether excluded by the prosecution and coupled with
the defence evidence, could have well been the person occupying the
said premises and hence the owner of the drugs as well as the
implements found there along with the pistol and the ammunition. A
consideration of all the circumstances leads me to conclude that a
conviction against both accused would be unsafe.
[156] With respect to the reaction by both accused in engaging in a
scuffle with the police, their evidence was that men wearing masks
broke the premises. That being the case, their reaction may be
altogether understandable as they were unsure of who these men were
at the time.
[157] It must also importantly be remembered that the prosecution
case was premised upon the act of trafficking as defined by section 2
DDA and in particular, the specific act of manufacturing. This fact
was fairly evident also from their opening statement (annexure A). No
presumptions under the DDA were therefore in operation or had arisen
against the accused persons. This being the case, all the defence had
to do was to merely raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.
The defence of the accused persons therefore need not have to be
believed in order for them to earn an acquittal. See Mat v. Public
Prosecutor (supra) and Public Prosecutor v. Mohd Radzi Bin Abu
Bakar (supra).
[158] Upon a consideration of all the evidence and upon a reevaluation of the prosecution case as tested against the defence
version, I find that the version of the defence that they were in fact at
the premises at the invitation of Vincent for the purpose of certain
work he had inquired of them, and that while he exited the premises,
the raid occurred while they waited for Vincent’s return, to have
raised a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case in respect of all the

56

five (5) charges against them. I therefore acquit and discharge both
accused of the all the five (5) charges against them.
