kewajipan  untuk  membangkitkan  sesuatu  anggapan  bagi  inferens  bertentangan  terhadap  pendakwaan  di  bawah  114g  akta  keterangan  1950  tidak  timbul  2  tidak  terdapat  pemutusan  rantaian  penyebab  dalam  kes  pendakwaan  kecederaan  yang  dialami  oleh  si  mati  di  jalan  johor  semabok  yang  disebabkan  oleh  perayuperayu  yang  telah  mengakibatkan  pendarahan  dalam  otak  si

si  mati  sahaja  dalam  keadaan  kes  ini  fakta  bahawa  pegawai  penyiasat  tidak  melakukan  siasatan  forensik  terhadap  rumput  yang  dijumpai  pada  bahagian  rambut  si  mati  tidak  akan

pertuduhan  adalah  cacat  tidak  mempunyai  asas  berdasarkan  keterangan  ahli  patologi  kerajaan  pw18  yang  telah  secara  positif  memberi  keterangan  bahawa  si  mati  telah  meninggal  dunia  akibat  kecederaan  yang  dialaminya  berikutan  serangan  terhadap  dirinya  oleh  perayuperayu  di  hadapan  pintu  pagar  rumah  yang  telah  diperihalkan  dalam  pertuduhan  di  jalan  johor  semabok  melaka  si  mati  telah  mengalami  kecederaan  di  kepala  disebabkan  penggunaan  senjatasenjata  seperti  kayukayu  dan  batang  besi  pada  pelbagai  bahagian  pada  dirinya  oleh  perayuperayu  dakwaan  perayuperayu  bahawa  si  mati  telah  meninggal  dunia  di  tanah  perkuburan  di  bukit  jelutong  melaka  adalah  tidak  berasas  4  pembelaan  alibi  seperti  manamana  pembelaan  yang  lain  harus  merujuk  kepada  dakwaan  yang  terkandung  dalam  pertuduhan  terhadap  tertuduh  oleh  demikian  adalah  tidak  terbuka  kepada  tertuduh  untuk  memilih  apakah  pertuduhan  yang  mungkin  boleh  dikenakan  terhadapnya  dalam  kes  ini  pertuduhan  telah  secara  jelas  menyatakan  bahawa  kesalahan  telah  berlaku  di  sebuah  tempat  di  jalan  johor  semabok  melaka  bukan  di  tanah  perkuburan  di  bukit  jelutong  ia  mungkin  versi  perayuperayu  bahawa  kejatuhan  yang  membawa  kematian  telah  berlaku  di  tanah  perkuburan  tetapi  ternyata  ia  bukan  versi  pendakwaan  seperti  yang  terbukti  berdasarkan  kandungan  pertuduhan  yang  telah  dikenakan  terhadap  mereka  eks  p1  berdasarkan  alasan  tersebut  sahaja  pembelaan  alibi  oleh  tertuduh  kedua  adalah  sememangnya  dan  sudah  tentu  cacat  5  berdasarkan  keseluruhan  sifat  keterangan  yang  telah  dikemukakan  oleh  pendakwaan  terhadap  kesemua  perayuperayu  keperluan  untuk  hakim  bicara  mempertimbangkan  pembelaan  yang  berkemungkinan  berkenaan  homisid  salah  dalam  kes  ini  tidak  timbul  daripada  sifat  kecederaankecederaan  yang  diakibatkan  ke  atas  si  mati  dan  di  mana  ke  atas  dirinya  kecederaankecederaan  tersebut  telah  diakibatkan  adalah  jelas  bahawa  kesan  yang  lebih  berkemungkinan  berdasarkan  kecederaankecederaan  yang  diakibatkan  telah  menyebabkan  kematian  si  mati  sememangnya  si  mati  meninggal  dunia  akibat  kecederaankecederaan  tersebut  keterangan  di  hadapannya  telah  mewajarkan  dapatan  hakim  bicara  berkenaan  pembunuhan  si  mati  yang  telah  dilakukan  oleh  perayuperayu  6  di  bawah  34  adalah  tidak  penting  siapa  di  antara  perayuperayu  yang  telah  mengakibatkan  kecederaan  yang  membawa  maut  oleh  kerana  ia  telah  diakibatkan  oleh  salah  seorang  daripada  mereka  lanjutan  daripada  niat  bersama  mereka  seperti  yang  telah
