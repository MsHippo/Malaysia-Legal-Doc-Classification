The appellant, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences committed under the Penal Code, the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (‘MACCA’) and the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities
Act 2001 (‘AMLATFAPUA’). At the High Court, the appellant sought
pre-trial production, by the respondent (‘the prosecution’), of statements and
documents given by potential witnesses to the officers of the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission (‘MACC’) in the course of the investigation. In
support of his application, the appellant submitted that (i) the non obstante
clauses, in s. 30(9) of the MACCA and s. 40 of the AMLATFAPUA,
rendered the statements recorded and documents collected during the course
of the investigations automatically admissible as evidence, at the behest of
either party to the proceedings; (ii) given the automatic admissibility,
arts. 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution (‘FC’) demand that copies of the said
documents and statements must be supplied by the prosecution to the
appellant before the commencement of the trial; and (iii) the crux of the
appellant’s case was supported by s. 51A of the Criminal Procedure Code
(‘CPC’) and s. 62 of the MACCA. The High Court Judge (‘HCJ’) found that
the appellant failed to establish a case for the delivery of the documents and
information applied for. In dismissing the appellant’s application, the HCJ
held that (i) the appellant failed to make out a case as to the extent to which
the legislature had intended to give the relevant non obstante clauses an
overriding effect over all other rules and legal provisions; (ii) as such claim
of privilege, public policy and confidentiality would still be applicable to bar
the production of the investigation statements and the other documents;
(iii) even if the other documents and investigation statements were
admissible, in the absence of clear statutory provisions, the appellant had no
right of disclosure or production of the same; (iv) section 62 of the MACCA
makes reference to s. 51A of the CPC and therefore, the MACCA envisages
disclosure of documents/statements under ss. 51 or 51A of the CPC; (v) the
appellant did not meet the threshold of the test of ‘desirability’ and
‘necessity’ under s. 51 of the CPC to justify the production of other
documents and the investigation statements. As the prosecution had duly
complied with s. 51A of the CPC, the disclosure obligation of documents,
on the part of the prosecution, for pre-trial, had been met. The appellant was
not entitled to any further disclosure at this stage; (vi) the case of Husdi v. PP
barred the disclosure of investigation statements; (vii) the issue of likelihood
of witness-tampering was another reason that investigations statements was
being prohibited to accused persons; and (viii) s. 124 of the Evidence Act
1950 (‘EA’) applied to bar the production of the investigation statements
which are confidential. Hence, the present appeal.

Held (dismissing appeal; affirming decision of High Court)
Per Zabariah Mohd Yusof JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) The appellant misconstrued the application of the non obstante clauses
found in s. 30(9) of the MACCA and s. 40 of the AMLATFAPUA, to
exclude all other legislations or provisions in force in other legislations,
particularly the EA. This could not be the intention of Parliament. The
non obstante clauses found in the said sections must be read subject to
rules of privilege and prohibition on the ground of public policy. The
appellant failed to show how he had been discriminated against, as
compared to other persons who are similarly under the investigation by
the MACC. (paras 27 & 29)
(2) Article 5(1) of the FC states that ‘No person shall be deprived of his life
or personal liberties save in accordance with law’, which implies it is
not absolute. Similarly, art. 8 of the FC, which is on the equality
principle, is also not absolute. The provisions of the MACCA applies
across the board on all persons alike and thus, the issue of discrimination
against the appellant did not arise. (paras 32-34)
(3) There is no compelling legal analysis that could support the argument
that automatic admissibility gives the automatic right to disclosure and
inspection, in the absence of clear legislative prescriptions to that effect.
Section 51A of the CPC provides for disclosure at pre-trial stage. It
provides access of disclosure, but a limited one, and does not envisage
full unlimited disclosure and inspection of the prosecution’s case.
Section 51A of the CPC lists the documents that are required to be
furnished to the accused before trial. However, the prosecution need not
supply any facts favourable to the defence of the accused if its disclosure
would be contrary to public interest. (paras 39-41)
(4) In exercising its discretion, under s. 51A of the CPC, for the supply of
documents before the commencement of trial, the court must have
regard to ss. 152, 153 and 154 of the CPC. Hence, the discovery at this
stage, namely at the pre-trial stage, as in the present case, is only limited
to matters that are specified in the charge, to enable the appellant to
prepare his defence. The appellant would not be prejudiced, in any
event, as the appellant had been fully informed of the charge against
him. Therefore, by virtue of s. 51A of the CPC, as the appellant was at
the pre-trial stage, he was only entitled to: (i) a copy of the first
information report made under s. 107 of the CPC; (ii) copies of
documents which the prosecution intended to tender as part of the
evidence for the prosecution; and (iii) written statement of facts
favourable to the defence of the accused. (paras 43-44)

(5) The appellant applied for all statements recorded by the MACC, and
other documents taken by them in the course of investigation, without
specifying the exact documents. The application was of a general nature
and not targeted towards any specific document. It is a general rule of
law that the request must be directed at a specific document and a
general direction to produce all documents relating to the subject matter
in dispute will not be enforced. (para 46)
(6) The appellant sought the statements given by potential witnesses to the
MACC and other documents obtained by the MACC under the relevant
provisions compelling production embodied in the MACCA and
AMLATFAPUA in the course of the investigations pertaining to the
charges against the appellant. It is trite that an accused person is not
entitled to copies of police statements recorded from witnesses in the
course of investigations. Firstly, such statement is a privileged document
and secondly, as a matter of public policy, it is undesirable for the
prosecution to supply the defence with the police statements as there is
a danger of tampering with witnesses. This failed the test of ‘desirability’
and ‘necessity’ in s. 51A of the CPC. (para 47)
(7) It was not in the public interest if statements taken from witnesses and
documents obtained during the course of police investigations be
furnished to the appellant. Section 124 of the EA provides that a public
officer could not be compelled to disclose communications made to him
in official confidence if he considers that public interest would suffer by
such disclosure. This would also include communications made to the
MACC officers in their official confidence. Providing the appellant with
the documents sought in the prayer, which were made in official
confidence to the MACC, would prejudice further investigations relating
to other cases involving the appellant. (para 49)
(8) It is the prerogative of the prosecution as to how to prove their case and
it is not for the court to anticipate as to how the prosecution is to proceed
with the conduct of proving the charges against the appellant. The
application in this case was not for documents which were specified in
the charge against the appellant. Therefore, to allow the appellant to go
beyond these particulars would be to provide the accused with the
knowledge of means by which the prosecution proposed to prove the
alleged facts. Save for the documents provided under s. 51A of the CPC,
the defence was not entitled to ask for disclosure or inspection of
documents/materials in the possession of the prosecution before the
commencement of the trial. (para 53)
(9) The appellant was not entitled to be supplied with the documents
sought. The HCJ did not err in his findings that the appellant failed to
establish a case for the delivery of the information and documents
sought. (paras 55 & 56)

Bahasa Malaysia Headnotes
Perayu, bekas Perdana Menteri Malaysia, dituduh dengan tujuh pertuduhan
pelakuan kesalahan-kesalahan berkaitan Kanun Keseksaan, Akta Suruhanjaya
Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia 2009 (‘ASPRM’) dan Akta Pengubahan Wang
Haram, Pencegahan Pembiayaan Keganasan dan Hasil Daripada Aktiviti
Haram 2001 (‘AMLATFAPUA’). Di Mahkamah Tinggi, perayu membuat
permohonan pra-perbicaraan agar responden (‘pihak pendakwaan’)
mengemukakan kenyataan-kenyataan dan dokumen-dokumen yang diberi
oleh saksi-saksi berpotensi kepada pegawai-pegawai Suruhanjaya Pencegahan
Rasuah Malaysia (‘SPRM’) semasa menjalankan siasatan. Menyokong
permohonannya, perayu menghujahkan (i) klausa-klausa non obstante, dalam
s. 30(9) ASPRM dan s. 40 AMLATFAPUA, menjadikan kenyataankenyataan yang direkod dan dokumen-dokumen yang diambil semasa
menjalankan siasatan, secara automatik, boleh diterima sebagai keterangan,
atas perintah salah satu pihak dalam prosiding; (ii) susulan kebolehterimaan
automatik ini, per. 5 dan 8 Perlembagaan Persekutuan (‘PP’) menuntut agar
semua salinan dokumen dan kenyataan ini dibekalkan oleh pihak
pendakwaan kepada perayu sebelum perbicaraan bermula; dan (iii) teras kes
perayu disokong oleh s. 51A Kanun Tatacara Jenayah (‘KTJ’) dan s. 62
ASPRM. Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi (‘HMT’) mendapati perayu gagal
membuktikan satu kes penyerahan dokumen-dokumen dan maklumat yang
dipohon. Menolak permohonan perayu, HMT memutuskan (i) perayu gagal
membuktikan satu kes tentang setakat mana badan perundangan meniatkan
agar klausa-klausa non obstante mempunyai kesan mengatasi semua peraturan
dan peruntukan undang-undang; (ii) berkenaan tuntutan keistimewaan, polisi
awam dan kerahsiaan masih terpakai dalam menghalang pengemukaan
kenyataan-kenyataan siasatan dan dokumen-dokumen lain; (iii) jika pun
lain-lain dokumen dan kenyataan-kenyataan siasatan boleh diterima, tanpa
peruntukan statutori, perayu tiada hak pendedahan atau pengemukaan;
(iv) seksyen 62 ASPRM merujuk pada s. 51A KTJ dan dengan itu, ASPRM
membayangkan pendedahan dokumen-dokumen/kenyataan-kenyataan
bawah ss. 51 dan 51A KTJ; (v) perayu tidak memenuhi ambang ujian
‘kebaikan’ dan ‘keperluan’ bawah s. 51 KTJ untuk mewajarkan
pengemukaan lain-lain dokumen dah kenyataan-kenyataan siasatan. Oleh
kerana pihak pendakwaan telah mematuhi s. 51A KTJ, kewajipan
pendedahan dokumen-dokumen, pra-perbicaraan oleh pihak pendakwaan,
sudah dipenuhi. Perayu tidak berhak terhadap pendedahan lanjut di peringkat
ini; (vi) kes Husdi v PP menghalang pendedahan kenyataan-kenyataan
siasatan; (vii) isu kemungkinan gangguan pada saksi ialah satu lagi sebab
kenyataan-kenyataan siasatan dilarang diberi kepada tertuduh-tertuduh; dan
(viii) s. 124 Akta Keterangan 1950 (‘AK’) terpakai untuk menghalang
pengemukaan kenyataan-kenyataan siasatan yang rahsia. Maka timbul
rayuan ini.

Diputuskan (menolak rayuan, mengesahkan keputusan Mahkamah
Tinggi)
Oleh Zabariah Mohd Yusof HMR menyampaikan penghakiman
mahkamah:
(1) Perayu tersalah tafsir pemakaian klausa-klausa non obstante dalam
s. 30(9) ASPRM dan s. 40 AMLATFAPUA, agar mengecualikan semua
perundangan atau peruntukan yang berkuat kuasa dalam lain-lain
perundangan, khususnya AK. Ini tentu bukan niat Parlimen. Klausaklausa non obstante dalam seksyen-seksyen tersebut mesti dibaca
tertakluk pada peraturan keistimewaan dan larangan atas sebab polisi
awam. Perayu gagal menunjukkan bagaimana beliau didiskriminasi,
berbanding lain-lain orang yang turut disiasat oleh SPRM.
(2) Perkara 5(1) PP menyatakan ‘Tiada seorang pun boleh diambil
nyawanya atau dilucutkan kebebasan dirinya kecuali mengikut undangundang’, yang menandakan ini bukan mutlak. Perkara 8 PP, yang
memperuntukkan tentang prinsip kesamarataan, juga bukan mutlak.
Peruntukan ASPRM terpakai menyeluruh pada semua orang dan oleh
itu, isu diskriminasi terhadap perayu tidak timbul.
(3) Tiada analisis undang-undang, yang mendesak, yang boleh menyokong
hujahan bahawa kebolehterimaan automatik memberi hak automatik
untuk mendedahkan dan memeriksa, tanpa peruntukan perundangan
jelas yang menyatakan sedemikian. Seksyen 51A KTJ memperuntukkan
pendedahan semasa peringkat pra-perbicaraan. Seksyen ini memberi
akses untuk pendedahan, tetapi terbatas, dan tidak membayangkan
pendedahan dan pemeriksaan penuh tidak terhad ke atas kes
pendakwaan. Seksyen 51A KTJ menyenaraikan dokumen-dokumen
yang perlu dikemukakan kepada tertuduh sebelum perbicaraan. Walau
bagaimanapun, pihak pendakwaan tidak perlu membekalkan apa-apa
fakta yang menyokong pembelaan tertuduh jika pendedahan sedemikian
bertentangan dengan kepentingan awam.
(4) Dalam menjalankan budi bicara, bawah s. 51A KTJ, untuk pembekalan
dokumen-dokumen sebelum bermula perbicaraan, mahkamah mesti
melihat pada ss. 152, 153 dan 154 KTJ. Oleh itu, penzahiran pada
peringkat ini, iaitu peringkat pra-perbicaraan, seperti dalam kes ini,
hanya terhad pada hal-hal perkara yang dinyatakan dalam pertuduhan,
untuk membolehkan perayu membuat persediaan untuk pembelaan
beliau. Perayu tidak akan terprejudis, dalam apa-apa jua keadaan, kerana
sedia maklum akan pertuduhan terhadap beliau. Oleh itu, berdasarkan
s. 51A KTJ, kerana perayu di peringkat pra-perbicaraan, beliau hanya
berhak mendapat: (i) sesalinan laporan maklumat pertama yang dibuat
bawah s. 107 KTJ; (ii) salinan semua dokumen yang pihak pendakwaan

ingin kemukakan sebagai sebahagian keterangan untuk pendakwaan; dan
(iii) pernyataan bertulis tentang fakta-fakta yang berpihak pada
pembelaan tertuduh.
(5) Perayu meminta semua kenyataan yang direkodkan oleh SPRM, dan
lain-lain dokumen yang diambil oleh mereka semasa menjalankan
siasatan, tanpa menyatakan dokumen-dokumen tersebut dengan tepat.
Permohonan tersebut bersifat umum dan tidak ditujukan pada dokumen
khusus. Menjadi satu peraturan umum undang-undang bahawa
permintaan mestilah ditujukan pada dokumen khusus dan satu tujuan
umum untuk mengemukakan semua dokumen berkenaan hal perkara
yang menjadi pertikaian tidak akan berkuat kuasa.
(6) Perayu meminta kenyataan-kenyataan yang diberi oleh saksi-saksi
berpotensi SPRM dan semua dokumen yang diperoleh oleh SPRM,
bawah peruntukan-peruntukan relevan ASPRM dan AMLATFAPUA,
yang mendesak pengemukaan semasa siasatan terhadap pertuduhanpertuduhan terhadap perayu. Undang-undang tetap menetapkan seorang
tertuduh tidak berhak atas salinan kenyataan-kenyataan polis yang
direkodkan daripada saksi-saksi semasa menjalankan siasatan. Pertama,
kenyataan sedemikian adalah dokumen istimewa dan kedua, sebagai
hal perkara polisi awam, tidak diingini jika pihak pendakwaan
membekalkan pihak pembelaan dengan kenyataan-kenyataan polis
kerana terdapat risiko gangguan saksi-saksi. Ini gagal ujian ‘kebaikan’
dan ‘keperluan’ bawah s. 51A KTJ.
(7) Bukanlah demi kepentingan awam jika kenyataan-kenyataan
yang diambil daripada saksi-saksi, dan dokumen-dokumen yang
diperoleh semasa siasatan polis dijalankan, dikemukakan kepada perayu.
Seksyen 124 AK memperuntukkan bahawa seorang pegawai awam tidak
boleh didesak agar mendedahkan komunikasi yang dibuat kepadanya
dalam keamanahan rasmi jika dia berpendapat kepentingan awam akan
terjejas dengan pendedahan tersebut. Ini termasuk komunikasi yang
dibuat kepada pegawai-pegawai SPRM dalam keamanahan rasmi.
Menyediakan buat perayu dokumen-dokumen yang dipohon dalam
permohonan, yang dibuat dalam keamanahan rasmi kepada SPRM, akan
memprejudis siasatan lanjut berkenaan lain-lain kes yang melibatkan
perayu.
(8) Menjadi prerogatif pihak pendakwaan bagaimana mereka hendak
membuktikan kes mereka dan mahkamah tidak boleh menjangka
bagaimana pihak pendakwaan akan meneruskan dengan pembuktian
pertuduhan-pertuduhan terhadap perayu. Permohonan dalam kes ini
bukan untuk dokumen-dokumen yang dinyatakan dalam pertuduhan
terhadap perayu. Oleh itu, membenarkan perayu melangkaui butir-butir
ini seolah-olah memberi seorang tertuduh maklumat tentang cara pihak

[2019] 5 CLJ

pendakwaan bercadang membuktikan fakta-fakta yang didakwa. Kecuali
dokumen-dokumen yang diperuntukkan bawah s. 51A KTJ, pihak
pembelaan tidak berhak memohon pendedahan atau permeriksaan
dokumen-dokumen/material-material dalam milikan pihak pendakwaan
sebelum perbicaraan bermula.

A

(9) Perayu tidak berhak dibekalkan dokumen-dokumen yang dipohon.
Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi tidak terkhilaf dalam dapatan beliau bahawa
perayu gagal membuktikan satu kes untuk penyerahan maklumat dan
dokumen-dokumen yang dipohon.

[1]
The appeal before us, is by the appellant against the decision of the
learned High Court Judge dismissing his application by way of notice of
motion for an order that the prosecution deliver certain documents,
statements, information and/or reports, statements of witnesses’ books,
accounts, computerised data, articles, list of witnesses and copies of witness
statements that the prosecution intends to adduce at trial.
[2]
The appellant is faced with seven charges relating to offences
committed under the Penal Code, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009 (MACC Act 2009) and the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001
(AMLATFA 2001). All charges were ordered to be jointly tried and trial is
to commence from 12 February 2019 to 29 March 2019.
[3]
The respondent/prosecution had delivered the necessary documents
under s. 51A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), mostly covering the
documents sought by the appellant in the notice of motion, save for
paras. 1(g), (h), (i), (j), and 2(b)(i) which are reproduced herein below:
1(g) records of all examinations and/or written statements on oath or
affirmations obtained pursuant to Section 30(1)(a) and/or Section
30(8) and/or section 30(1)(c) of the MACC Act 2009 and/or Section
32(2)(a) and/or Section 32(2)(c) of the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing And Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act
2001 (AMLAFTA 2001) during the course of investigations which
have culminated into the subject matter of the SRC Proceedings;
1(h) all books, documents, records, accounts or computerised data or
articles obtained pursuant to Section 30(1)(b) of the MACC Act
2009 or otherwise in the course of examinations under Section 30(a)

The learned trial judge dismissed the appellant’s application for the
documents as aforesaid and it is against the dismissal of this application that
the appellant is appealing before this court.
Basis Of The Application By The Appellant
[5]
The application is premised on the non-obstante clauses found in
s. 30(9) of the MACC Act 2009 and s. 40 of the AMLATFA 2001, whereby
these statements, documents etc, such as those obtained under s. 30(9) of
MACC Act 2009 and s. 40 of AMLATFA 2001, are automatically
admissible at the behest of either party. The clauses should be given a liberal
interpretation, unlike the narrow scope given by the learned judge.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

33

Section 30(9) of the MACC Act 2009 provides:
The record of an examination under paragraph (1)(a), or a written
statement on oath or affirmation made pursuant to paragraph 1(c), or any
book, document, record, account or computerised data, or article
produced under paragraph (1)(b) or otherwise in the course of an
examination under paragraph (1)(a), or under a written statement on oath
or affirmation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(c), or record of examination
of sample taken under paragraph (1)(d) shall, notwithstanding any
written law or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible in evidence in
any proceedings in any court:
(a) For an offence under this Act; or
(b) For the forfeiture of property pursuant to section 40 or 41,
regardless whether such proceedings are against the persons who
was examined, or who produced the book, document, record,
account or computerized data, or article, or who made the written
statement on oath or affirmation, or against any other person.
(emphasis added)

Section 40 of the AMLATFA 2001 provides:

E

F

G

40. The record of an examination under paragraph 32(2)(a), any property,
record, report or document produced under paragraph 32(2)(b) or any
statement under paragraph 32(2)(c) shall, notwithstanding any written
law or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible as evidence in any
proceedings in any court for or in relation to an offence or any other
matter under this Act or any offence under any written law, regardless
whether such proceedings are against the persons who was examined, or
who produced the property, record, report or document, or who made the
written statements on oath or affirmation, or against any other person.
(emphasis added)

[6]
It is the appellant’s contention that the operational parts of the said
provisions provide that any statements or documents obtained in the course
of investigations “Notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to the
contrary, be admissible as evidence” thus taking the form of a non-obstante
clause.
[7]
Further, it was argued that, the scope of the non-obstante clauses are
unambiguous and exclude all rules of admission and rules of exclusion
vis-à-vis:

H

I

(i) All statements recorded from witnesses during the entire investigations
into the subject matter of the offences under the Penal Code, MACC Act
2009 and AMLATFA 2001 (investigation statements);
(ii) All other documents received by the authorities in the course of the
above investigations (other documents).



Current Law Journal

[8]
Given the automatic admissibility, the operation of arts. 5 and 8 of the
Federal Constitution would demand that copies of the said documents and
investigation statements must be supplied by the respondent as the prosecutor
to the applicant, before the commencement of the trial. It was also asserted
by the appellant that the application is also supported by the operation of
s. 62 of the MACC Act 2009 which provides:

A

B

62. Defence Statement
Once delivery of documents by the prosecution pursuant to section 51A
of the Criminal Procedure Code has taken place, the accused shall, before
commencement of the trial, deliver the following documents to the
prosecution:

C

(a) A defence statement setting out in general terms the nature of the
defence and the matters on which the accused takes issue with the
prosecution, with reasons; and
(b) A copy of any document which would be tendered as part of the
evidence for the defence.

D

[9]
The common law privilege outlined in Husdi v. PP [1979] 1 LNS 33;
[1979] 2 MLJ 304 has no application.
[10] The public policy on witness tampering has no application in this case
and neither is it justified. The reasoning by the learned trial judge in
para. 112 of the grounds was completely baseless as there is nothing in any
of the respondent’s affidavits which alleged any reluctance or possible
reluctance by any potential witnesses. Neither is there anything in the
affidavits of the respondent which alleged any repercussions to other possible
investigations or even the existence of any other pending investigations
against the appellant. It is noted that the powers of the investigators under
the MACC Act 2009 and AMLATFA 2001 clearly compel witnesses to
provide statements to the MACC Act 2009 on penal consequences of non
attendance. There is further provisions for witness to seek for witness
protection as laid down in the Witness Protection Act 2009.

E

F

G

[11] In light of the circumstances of this case, it was submitted by the
appellant that the production of investigation statements and other
documents would be necessary or desirable under s. 51 of the CPC.
Respondent’s Argument
[12] The respondent’s position is that the application ought to be dismissed
as the applicant has misconstrued s. 30(9) of MACC Act and s. 40 of
AMLATFA to exclude all other legislation/provisions, particularly the
Evidence Act 1950. The non-obstante clauses must be read subject to the rules
of privilege and prohibition on grounds of public policy (See Husdi v. PP
[1979] 1 LNS 33; [1979] MLJ 304; PP v. Raymond Chia Kim Chwee & Anor
& Another Case [1985] 2 CLJ 457; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 260; [1985] 2 MLJ 436;
PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim & Another Appeal [2010] 4 CLJ 331).

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

35

[13] The respondent disagreed with the prismatic approach taken by the
applicant in the interpretation of arts. 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution in
support of the applicant’s argument that these two articles would mean that
the automatic admissibility of the documents pursuant to the non-obstante
clauses necessarily require disclosure of copies of such documents by either
side.
The Issue

C

[14] The central issue is whether the non-obstante clause has the effect of
excluding the rules on evidence in respect of rules on privilege or
confidentiality.
[15] The learned trial judge dismissed the appellant’s application as the
appellant failed to establish a case for the delivery of documents and the
information applied for.
The High Court Findings

D

[16] The High Court made the following findings as to the application by
the appellant:

E

F

G

(i) The appellant failed to make out a case as to the extent to which the
Legislature had intended to give the relevant non-obstante clauses an
overriding effect over all other rules and legal provisions, premised on
the weight of authorities in Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail
[2016] 3 CLJ 19; [2016] 1 MLJ 733, which subject the admissibility to
the rules of evidence and Ho Tack Sien & Ors v. Rotta Research
Laboratorium S.p.A & Anor; Registrar Of Trade Marks (Intervener) & Another
Appeal [2015] 4 CLJ 20; [2015] 4 MLJ 166 which required specific
identification of the rules to be excluded. The learned trial judge was not
persuaded by the proposition of the counsel for the appellant that the
non-obstante clauses had the effect of automatic disclosure of all
statements and documents admissible obtained by MACC as evidence in
any proceedings;
(ii) As such claims of privilege, public policy and confidentiality would still
be applicable to bar the production of the investigation statements and
the other documents;

H

I

(iii) Even if the other documents and investigation statements are admissible,
in the absence of clear statutory provisions, the appellant has no right
of disclosure or production of the same. Section 62 of the MACC Act
2009 makes reference to s. 51A of the CPC and therefore the MACC Act
2009 envisages disclosure of documents/statements under ss. 51A or 51
of the CPC.
(iv) The appellant clearly does not meet the threshold of the test of
“desirability or necessity” under s. 51 of the CPC justifying the
production of the other documents and the investigation statements. As



Current Law Journal

36

[2019] 5 CLJ

the prosecution has duly complied with s. 51A of the CPC, the
disclosure obligation of documents on the part of the prosecution for
pre-trial has been met, and the appellant is not entitled to any further
disclosure at this stage;
(v) Husdi v. PP [1979] 1 LNS 33; [1979] MLJ 304 bars the disclosure of
investigation statements;

A

B

(vi) The issue of the likelihood of witness tampering is another reason that
investigation statements are prohibited from being disclosed to the
accused persons;
(vii) Section 124 of the Evidence Act 1950 applies to bar the production of
the investigation statements which are confidential.

C

Our Decision
Whether The Non-obstante Clauses Exclude All Other Provisions Of The Law
[17] The learned trial judge made reference to Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk
Ishak Ismail which held that where statements taken in the course of
investigation are to be automatically admissible, they must be subject to
provisions of the Evidence Act 1950, which were made to codify rules
pertaining to law of privilege and public policy against disclosure of
investigation statements. While the appellant argued that the provisions in
Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail’s case do not involve a non-obstante
clause, the learned trial judge further referred to Ho Tack Sien & Ors v. Rotta
Research Laboratorium S.p.A & Anor; Registrar Of Trade Marks (Intervener) &
Another Appeal and held that the appellant had not clearly made out a case
as to the extent to which the Legislature had intended to give the relevant
non-obstante clauses overriding effect over all other rules and legal
provisions.
[18] In PP v. Awalluddin Sham Bokhari [2018] 1 CLJ 305; [2018] 2 MLJ 401
which concerned a non-obstante clause in AMLATFA, it was ruled by the
Federal Court that the statements and documents exhibited to the
investigation officer’s affidavit were admissible, notwithstanding the rule
against hearsay. This is in relation to s. 134(4) of the Securities Commission
Malaysia Act 1993 (SCA) which was examined by the Federal Court in
Suruhanjaya Securities v. Dato Ishak Ismail where the accused had applied for
discovery of all statements made to and recorded by the investigation officer
of the Securities Commission in relation to investigation against the accused.
The Federal Court after reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal
dismissed the application for the production of such statements. Section
134(4) of the SCA 1993 provides:
134. Power to call for examination
(1) If an Investigating Officer of the Commission carrying out an
investigation under any securities law suspects or believes on
reasonable grounds that any person can give information relevant

to a matter that he is investigating, the Investigating Officer of the
Commission may by notice in writing to such person require such
person:
(a) To give to the Investigating Officer of the Commission all
reasonable assistance in connection with the investigation; and

B

C

D

(b) To appear before a specified Investigating Officer of the
Commission or specified Investigating Officers of the
Commission to be examined orally.
(1A) An Investigating Officer of the Commission exercising his authority
under paragraph (1)(b) shall reduce into writing any statement made
by the person examined under subsection (1).
(2) A person referred to in subsection (1) shall be legally bound to
answer all questions relating to such case put to him by the
Investigating Officer of the commission and to state the truth,
whether or not the statement is made wholly or partly in answer to
questions, and shall not refuse to answer any question on the
ground that it tends to incriminate him.
(3) ...
(4) Any statement made and recorded under this section shall be
admissible as evidence in any proceeding in any Court.

[19] The Federal Court ruled that the provision under s. 134(4) of the SCA
must be read subject to the rules of privilege and prohibition on grounds of
public policy. This equally applies to civil and criminal proceedings. In the
context of Suruhanjaya Securities v. Dato Ishak Ismail, the relevant and
applicable rules for consideration are found in ss. 123 and 124 of the
Evidence Act 1950. Sections 123 and 124 of the Evidence Act 1950 codify
the rules of the law of privilege and public policy against the disclosure of
investigation statements.
[20] However, the appellant submitted that his application is in “stark
contrast” to the application in Suruhanjaya Securities v. Dato Ishak Ismail
which was made under s. 134 of the Securities Commission Malaysia Act
1993 (SCA), and does not have the non-obstante clauses as in s. 30(9) of the
MACC Act 2009 and s. 40 of the AMLATFA 2001. Hence the principle of
law as enunciated by the Federal Court in Suruhanjaya Securities v. Dato Ishak
Ismail that “statements made to and recorded by an investigating officer ...
are not to be disclosed to the defence” and ss. 123 and 124 of the Evidence
Act 1950 are superseded by the non-obstante clauses contained in the
provisions.
[21] The learned trial judge, had considered this point specifically and
noted that the non-obstante clause was absent in s. 134(4) of the SCA.
However, there are a plethora of authorities which suggest that where the
non-obstante clause refers generally without stating the specific provision or
statute to be overridden, it is not permissible to exclude per se all other



38

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

legislations or provisions in force in other statutes. In the absence of specific
words of the exact rules or laws to be excluded, no such automatic
displacement can be made effective.
[22] It is noted that the non-obstante clauses contain the word
“Notwithstanding ...”. The Federal Court in Perbadanan Kemajuan Kraftangan
Malaysia v. DW Margaret David Wilson [2010] 5 CLJ 899; [2010] 2 MLJ 713
at p. 912 (CLJ); p. 726 (MLJ) had the occasion to explain the term
“notwithstanding” which is:
The term “notwithstanding” means generally “not to stand against it”, or
“in the way” or overriding.
The words notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure Code found at the beginning of s. 5A(1) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1947 (now s. 17 Prevention of Corruption Act 1988)
merely carve out a limited exemption from the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure in so far as they limit the class of persons who are
competent to investigate offences mentioned in the section and to arrest
without warrant. It does not mean that the whole of the Code of Criminal
Procedure ... is made inapplicable - Union of India v. IC Lala [1973]
2 SCC 72 at 77.

A

B

C

D

(emphasis added)

[23] From the grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge said that the
extent of such exclusion must be worked out from a further examination of
the true objective or scope or purpose behind the provisions where the
non-obstante clause is adopted. The learned trial judge agreed that a literal
reading appears to support the appellant’s stance, which, if true means the
operation of, inter alia, the Evidence Act 1950 in respect of the rules on
privilege and confidentiality in admitting as evidence, documents or
statements obtained under s. 30 of the MACCA and s. 32 of the AMLATFA
would be excluded.
[24] The learned trial judge also held that if there arises a conflict between
the specific statutory objective behind that provision and such other law on
the same subject, the other law would be held to be excluded from being
operative. He referred to the Federal Court case of Ho Tack Sien & Ors v. Rotta
Research Laboratorium S.p.A & Anor; Registrar Of Trade Marks (Intervener) &
Another Appeal [2015] 4 CLJ 20; [2015] 4 MLJ 166 where it concerns s. 40
of the Trade Marks Act 1976 which begins with the word “notwithstanding
...” and Zulkefli CJ (Malaya) (as he then was) held that it is a general
principle that a non-obstante clause cannot go outside the limits of the Act
itself. Non-obstante clause is subject to the limitations contained in the section
and cannot be read excluding the whole Act and standing by itself.
The Federal Court relied on the principle as stated in Varadarajulu & Anor
v. The State of Tamil Nadu & Ors AIR 1998 SC 1388 which states:

E

F

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

39

It is well settled that while dealing with a non-obstante clause under which
the legislature wants to give overriding effect to a section, the Court must
try to find out the extent to which the legislature had intended to give
one provision overriding effect over another provision. Such intention of
the legislature in this behalf is to be gathered from the enacting part of
the section. In Aswini Kumar v. Arbinda Bose AIR 1952 SC 369, Patanjali
Sastri J observed: The enacting part of a statute must, where it is clear,
be taken to control the non-obstante clause where both cannot be read
harmoniously. In Madhav Rao Scindia v. Union of India [1971] 1 SCC 85
(at p 139) AIR 1971 SC 530 Hidayatullah CJ observed that the
non-obstante clause is no doubt a very potent clause intended to exclude
every consideration arising from other provisions of the same statute or
other statute but for that reason alone we must determine the scope of
that provision strictly. When the section containing the said clause does
not refer to any particular provisions of the statute generally, it is not
permissible to hold that it excludes the whole Act and stands all alone
by itself. A search has, therefore, to be made with a view to determining
which provisions answer the description and which does not.

Therefore as far as Ho Tack Sien & Ors is concerned, the Federal Court ruled
that s. 40(1)(f) of the Trade Marks Act 1976 “only applies to a right to use
a mark that has been duly registered under the Act”. It is therefore tied to
s. 35(1) of the Act which governs the rights given by registration. It reads:
E

F

G

H

I

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the registration of a person ... as
registered proprietor of a trade mark (other than a certification trade mark)
in respect of any goods or services shall, if valid, give or be deemed to
have been given to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade
mark in relation to those goods or services subject to any conditions,
amendments, modifications or limitations entered in the Register.

[25] Premised on the weight of authorities of Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk
Ishak Ismail, which subject the admissibility to the rules on evidence and
Ho Tack Sien & Ors v. Rota Research Laboratorium SPA, which requires specific
reference to the provision/statute to be excluded, the learned trial judge
concluded and held that the appellant had not clearly made out a case as to
the extent to which the Legislature had intended to give the relevant
non-obstante clauses overriding effect over all other rules and legal
provisions. It is our view that the learned trial judge did not err in his judicial
evaluation of the provisions and consideration of the authorities cited.
[26] In any event, the learned trial judge had gone on to consider that, even
if the construction ascribed to the non-obstante clauses by the appellant is to
be taken as correct, that the documents and statements obtained during
investigations are admissible as of right, the appellant still failed to establish
whether their production to the appellant as the accused must necessarily
follow. As rightly pointed out by the learned trial judge that admissibility of
these documents does not equate to the right to inspect.



40

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[27] Therefore, it appears that the appellant had misconstrued the
application of the non-obstante clauses found in s. 30(9) of the MACCA and
s. 40 of the AMLATFA 2001 to exclude all other legislation or provisions
in force in other legislations particularly the Evidence Act 1950. That cannot
be the intention of Parliament. The non-obstante clauses found in the
aforesaid sections must be read subject to the rules of privilege and
prohibition on the grounds of public policy.
[28] Various authorities were cited by the appellant in support of the
equality of arms principle by claiming the appellant was being put at a
disadvantage if not afforded the opportunity to view the documents etc. It
was submitted that the appellant as an accused person should be accorded
equal opportunity in deciding whether to admit the said evidence or
otherwise premised on the observations by Lord Mustill in Re D (Minors)
(Adoption reports: Confidentiality) [1996] AC 593 where he said:
(the) first principle of fairness (is) that each party to a judicial process
should have an opportunity to answer by evidence and by argument any
adverse material that the tribunal may take into account when forming its
opinion.

[29] This was also considered by the learned trial judge and we agree with
his view that the appellant failed to show how has he been discriminated
against, as compared to other persons who are similarly under investigation
by the MACC.
[30] True, other countries have had advancements in adhering to the equal
arms principle, as demonstrated by the cases cited by the appellant from the
various jurisdiction in the submissions. The authorities cited by the
applicant, namely Fitt v. United Kingdom [2000] ECHR 29777/96 which held
that “it is a fundamental aspect of the right of a fair trial that criminal
proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to
procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms
between the prosecution and defence”. The learned trial judge had
considered this, at best, to be of persuasive authority. It is also undeniable
that some of the authorities cited by the appellant expressed concerns against
unfettered access by accused persons to investigations documents and
statements as shown in the South Africa Constitutional Court in Shabalala v.
AG of the Transvaal and Anor 1995 (12) BCLR 1593 which was an authority
relied upon by the appellant which ruled:
[5] The state is entitled to resist a claim by the accused for access to any
particular document in the police docket on the grounds that such access
is not justified for the purposes of enabling the accused properly to
exercise his or her right to a fair trial or on the ground that it has reason
to believe that there is reasonable risk that access to the relevant
document would lead to the disclosure of the identity of an informer or
state secrets or on the grounds that there was a reasonable risk that such
disclosure might lead to the intimidation of witnesses or otherwise
prejudice the proper end of justice.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

41

[31] The appellant submitted that the operation of arts. 5 and 8 of the
Federal Constitution demand that copies of the said documents and
statements must be provided to the appellant before the commencement of
trial. It was further submitted that in line with art. 5 and the application and
ambit of s. 62 of the MACC Act 2009 justifies disclosure of admissible
documents and statements to the appellant.
[32] Article 5(1) of the Federal Constitution states that “No person shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberties save in accordance with law” which
implies that it is not absolute. In Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar
Balakrishnan [2002] 4 CLJ 105; [2002] 3 MLJ 72, where the constitutionality
of s. 59 of the Immigration Act 1959/63 was challenged on the basis that the
exclusion of the right to be heard in that provision, before the cancellation
of the respondent’s entry permit, was unconstitutional as it was said to have
infringed his right to livelihood. It was held that the constitutional rights as
guaranteed by art. 5(1) can be deprived in accordance with law. (See also
S Kulasingam & Anor v. Commissioner of Lands, Federal Territory & Ors [1982]
1 MLJ 204).

E

[33] Similarly, art. 8 of the Federal Constitution, which is the equality
principle is also not absolute. The principles on the interpretation of art. 8
of the Federal Constitution was laid down in Datuk Haji Harun Idris v. PP
[1976] 1 LNS 180; [1976] 2 MLJ 116 which essentially held that the equality
provision is not absolute, it is qualified and that it envisages that there may
be lawful discrimination based on rational classification (See also PP v. Khong
Teng Khen [1976] 1 LNS 100; [1976] 2 MLJ 166).

F

[34] The provisions of the MACC Act 2009 applies across the board on all
persons alike, and thus the issue of discrimination against the appellant does
not arise.

G

H

I

[35] The reference of the appellant to the provisions on fundamental
liberties of Constitutions of South Africa is misconceived as the provision in
their Constitution is different from our art. 8 and s. 35(3)(h) of the
Constitution of South Africa provides that “Every accused person shall have
the right to a fair trial, which shall include the right to be presumed innocent
and to remain silent during plea proceedings or trial and not to testify during
trial.” In this regard, the judgment of Raja Azan Shah J (as he then was) in
Loh Kooi Choon v. Government of Malaysia [1975] 1 LNS 90; [1977] 2 MLJ
187 is relevant where His Lordship said:
Whatever may be said of other Constitutions, they are ultimately of little
assistance to us because our Constitution now stands in its own right and
it is in the end the wording of our Constitution itself that is to be
interpreted and applied, and this wording ‘can never be overridden by
extraneous principles of other Constitutions’ ... Each country frames its
constitution according to its genius and for the good of its own society.

We look at other Constitution to learn from their experiences, and from
a desire to see how their progress and well-being is ensured by their
fundamental law.

[36] Section 51A of the CPC is a step towards the equality in arms
principle. As stated by the learned trial judge, any further development must
await legislative interventions, and not by a mere prismatic construction of
constitutional provisions.

A

B

[37] In the context of s. 62 of the MACC Act 2009, the appellant argued
that these investigation statements and other documents are admissible as of
right, and which admissions, should be the prerogative of both parties.
C

[38] The learned trial judge found that the reasoning advanced by the
appellant in regard to s. 62 of the MACC Act 2009 is rather misconceived
and unsustainable. Such arguments defeat the purpose of Parliament
legislating the MACC Act 2009 to rely on s. 51A in s. 62 of the MACC Act
2009. The learned trial judge found that other than s. 51A of CPC and s. 62
of the MACC Act 2009, there is no other law that exists demanding
disclosure, and no automatic disclosure can be founded on non-obstante
clause. Further, if automatic disclosure is correct, without any express
provisions on production, it would not have been necessary for the MACC
Act 2009 to enact s. 62 of the MACC Act 2009 at all. We do not see how
is the judge wrong in such reasoning. It is trite that Parliament does not
legislate in vain.
[39] Section 51A of the CPC is a significant amendment with regards to
disclosure at pre-trial stage. So is s. 62 of the MACC Act 2009. There is no
compelling legal analysis that could support the argument that automatic
admissibility gives the automatic right to disclosure and inspection, in the
absence of clear legislative prescriptions to that effect.
[40] Section 51A of the CPC provides for disclosure at pre-trial stage. It
provides access of disclosure, but a limited one and does not envisage full
unlimited disclosure and inspection of the prosecution’s case. Section 51A
of the CPC provides:

E

F

G

51A(1) The prosecution shall before the commencement of the trial deliver
to the accused the following documents:
(a) A copy of the information made under section 107 relating to the
commission of the offence to which the accused is charged, if any;

H

(b) A copy of any document which would be tendered as part of the
evidence for the prosecution; and
(c) A written statement of facts favourable to the defence of the
accused signed under the hand of the Public Prosecutor or any
person conducting the prosecution.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), the prosecution may not supply any
fact favourable to the accused if its supply would be contrary to public
interest.

(3) A document shall not be inadmissible in evidence merely because of
non-compliance with subsection (1).
(4) The Court may exclude any document delivered after the
commencement of the trial if it is shown that such delivery was done
deliberately and in bad faith.

B

(5) Where a document is delivered to the accused after the

F

G

H

I

(b) To recall or re-summon and examine any witness in relation to the
document.
(emphasis added)

[41] Section 51A lists the documents that are required to be furnished to
the accused before trial. But as for fact that is favourable to the defence ie,
s. 51A(1)(c), the prosecution need not supply any fact favourable to the
defence of the accused, if its disclosure would be contrary to public interests.
Further, s. 51A(5) of the CPC provides that where the document is delivered
to the accused after the trial had commenced, the court shall give to the
accused reasonable time to examine the document and to recall and examine
any witness in relation to the document. However, notwithstanding the
aforesaid, the court may exclude the document to be delivered after the trial
had commenced if it is shown that such delivery was done deliberately and
in bad faith.
[42] There are leading authorities and case laws which have established this
clear proposition of law on the scope of s. 51A of the CPC (Refer to: Syed
Abu Bakar Ahmad v. PP [1981] 1 LNS 127; [1982] 2 MLJ 186; PP v. Raymond
Chia Kim Chwee & Anor & Another Case [1985] 2 CLJ 457; [1985] CLJ (Rep)
260; [1985] 2 MLJ 436.) The decision of Raymond Chia Kim Chwee was
followed in PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim & Another Appeal [2010] 4 CLJ
331).
[43] In PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim & Another [2010] 4 CLJ 331, the
accused applied for the production of witness statements of various witnesses
and all documents not used by the prosecution and a list of prosecution
witnesses at the pre-trial stage, similar as in our present case (refer to
pp. 273-274 of the report). At the High Court, the application was allowed.
However, the Court of Appeal set aside the order of the High Court which
was affirmed by the Federal Court. PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim And
Another referred to Raymond Chia Kim Chwee. It is pertinent to quote what
was said by Hashim Yeop Sani SCJ in Raymond Chia Kim Chwee at pp. 264
& 264 (CLJ); p. 439 (MLJ), the legal position in the following terms:
The entitlement of the accused under section 51 of the CPC to any
document or copies of document or other material in the possession of
the prosecution is entirely at the discretion of the Court having regard to
the justice of the case. The discretion should not however be exercised



44

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

so as to enable the accused to gain access to materials before the trial as
in the case of pre-trial discovery and inspection of documents in a civil
proceeding. The accused in a criminal trial should have sufficient notice
of what is alleged against him so as to enable him to prepare his defence.
So long as that requirement is satisfied the law is satisfied ...

A

... If the discretion is to be exercised before the commencement of the trial
the Court cannot anticipate how the prosecution will proceed. In other
words the court would not be justified to direct the prosecution to deliver
to the accused all documents taken from him for that will not be a correct
exercise of the discretion under section 51 of the Criminal procedure
Code ...

B

Under section 51A of the CPC the accused is most certainly entitled to
have copies of documents which are specified in the charge. But the
accused cannot be expected to be given access to all documents
whatsoever taken by the police during investigation ... .

In exercising its discretion under s. 51A for the supply of documents before
the commencement of trial, the court must have regard to ss. 152, 153 and
154 of the CPC. Hence the discovery at this stage, namely at the pre-trial
stage, as in our present case (where trial has not commenced) is only limited
to matters that are specified in the charge, to enable the appellant to prepare
his defence. The appellant would not be prejudiced in any event as the
appellant had been fully informed of the charge against him. How can it be
said that the appellant would be put at a disadvantage in preparing his defence
as that is not a relevant consideration at this stage. The Federal Court in
Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2010] 4 CLJ 265 held that:
[4] Sections 51 and 51A are two separate and distinct provisions. Section
51A imposes an obligation upon the prosecution to supply the accused
with certain documents and materials. It has no connection to s. 51 which
gives the court discretion to allow for discovery in specific instances.
Section 51 could not be modified with the aid of the supposed philosophy
underlying the new s. 51A, even if such philosophy existed. It was thus
wrong for the judge to conclude that s. 51A, had changed the mode of
prosecution in a criminal trial, and in the process ignore past precedents
on interpretation. It was also wrong for the judge to say that earlier cases
decided on s. 51 were no longer applicable.
[5] In the instant case, the application for discovery by the Appellant was
made at a pre-trial stage and not made “in the course of the trial”. At the
pre-trial stage the appellant would only be entitled to those documents
and materials pertaining to the charge, to enable him to understand the
charge and prepare his defence. The phrase “in the course of trial” means
that the trial proper has commenced in that evidence has been led by the
calling of witnesses. The phrase does not mean the stage where the
charge is only read to the accused. PP v. Raymond Chia Kim Chwee & Anor
(foll) ...
[6] Although s. 51 appears couched in rather wide terms, it should not
literally be taken to be capable of allowing for a wide ranging application,
as in the instant case. Its scope is confined to the production of

documents or materials “necessary or desirable” for the purposes of trial.
These 2 qualifications depend on which particular stage or point of time
the application is made. If, as in this case, it is made at the pre-trial stage,
then the discovery must be confined to the matters specified in the charge.
In the instant case, the charge was specific and was sufficiently
particularised to accord the appellant a fair trial. The requirement of justice
had been met, even without the documents and materials sought. PP v.
Raymond Chia Kim Chwee & Anor (foll) ...

[44] Therefore, by virtue of s. 51A of the CPC, as we are now at the
pre-trial stage, the appellant is only entitled to the following documents:
C

(i) A copy of the first information report made under s. 107 of the CPC;
(ii) Copies of documents which the prosecution intends to tender as part of
the evidence for the prosecution; and
(iii) Written statement of facts favourable to the defence of the accused.

D

What the appellant sought in his notice of motion in prayer (1)(g) are for
examination and written statements on oath or affirmations recorded by
MACC under MACC Act 2009 or AMLATFA 2001. Essentially, the
appellant is asking for him to be supplied with all statements recorded from
witnesses other than the appellant/accused.

E

[45] In prayer 1(h), the appellant is asking for inspection of documents
seized in the course of investigation which is not within the ambit of s. 51A.

F

G

H

I

[46] The appellant is applying for all statements recorded by the MACC
and other documents taken by them in the course of investigation without
specifying the exact documents. The application is of a general nature and
not targeted towards any specific document. It is a general rule of law that
the request must be directed at a specific document and a general direction
to produce all documents relating to the subject matter in dispute will not be
enforced (Refer to PP v. Teoh Choon Teck [1962] 1 LNS 141; [1963] 1 MLJ
34.)
[47] The application is also for statements given by potential witness to the
MACC and other documents obtained by the MACC under the relevant
provisions compelling production embodied in the MACC Act 2009 and
AMLATFA 2001 in the course of investigation pertaining to the charges
against the appellant. It is trite that an accused person is not entitled to copies
of police statements recorded from witnesses recorded in the course of
investigations. Firstly, such statement is a privileged document
(see Methuram Dass v. Jagannath Dath ILR 28 Cal 794) and secondly, as a
matter of public policy, it is undesirable for the prosecution to supply the
defence with the police statements as there is a danger of tampering with
witnesses (Refer to Husdi v. PP [1980] 1 LNS 29; [1980] 2 MLJ 80). This
fails the test of desirability and necessity in s. 51A of the CPC.



46

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[48] It has been submitted by the appellant that the respondent’s affidavits
did not aver on any reluctance or possible reluctance by any potential
witnesses. Neither is there any averments by the respondent in any of the
affidavits which alleged any repercussions to other possible investigations or
even the existence of any other pending investigations against the appellant.
It is also to be noted that the powers of the investigators under the MACC
Act 2009 and AMLATFA 2001 clearly compel witnesses to provide
statements to the MACC Act 2009 and the penal consequences of non
attendance. On this, we refer to what was said by the Federal Court in Husdi
v. PP [1980] 1 LNS 29; [1980] MLJ 80 at p. 82:

A

We do not think that the prosecution should supply copies of the police
statement direct to the defence without the intervention of the courtbecause of the peculiar circumstances prevailing in this country. Malaysia
is a small country, with a small population, and Malaysians are easily
scared; they are reluctant to be involved. If a crime is committed under
their nose they look the other way, see, hear and say nothing, do little
or nothing to help identify - let alone - arrest an offender, and yet
complain that the police do not catch criminals and that courts are
bedazzled by technicalities. If the prosecution is obliged to supply copies
of police statements to the defence without the intervention of the court,
the defence may be tempted to ask for, and the prosecution will be obliged
to supply copies of every statement in the police investigation file, and
Malaysians will be more reluctant to come forward with evidence to
incriminate their fellows.

C

Thus, regardless of the absence of any averments by the respondent in the
affidavits as to the possibility of witness tampering, the risk is substantive and
real.
[49] Further, it is not in the public interest if statements taken from
witnesses and documents obtained during the course of police investigations
be furnished to the appellant. Section 124 of the Evidence Act 1950 provides
that a public officer cannot be compelled to disclose communications made
to him in official confidence if he considers that public interest would suffer
by such disclosure. This will also include communications made to MACC
officers in their official confidence (See s. 6(2) of the MACCA 2009).
Providing the appellant with the documents sought for in the prayers which
were made in official confidence to the MACC would prejudice further
investigations relating to other cases involving the appellant (See Suruhanjaya
Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail).
[50] The learned trial judge based his findings on the ratio in the case of
Federal Court case of Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail which held
that the provision of s. 134(4) of the SCA must be read subject to the rules
of privilege and prohibition on grounds of public policy.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

47

[51] The learned trial judge held that the statements of witnesses made to
MACC officers are privileged documents under s. 124 of the Evidence Act
1950. Therefore, it is his findings that as investigators are public officers
under s. 6(2) of the MACCA thus attracting s. 124 of the Evidence Act 1950
which means communications made to such officers of MACC in official
confidence cannot be compelled to be disclosed.
[52] It is the prerogative of the prosecution as to how to prove their case
and it is not for the court to anticipate as to how the prosecution is to proceed
with the conduct of proving the charge against the appellant.

C

D

E

F

G

H

I

[53] The application in this case is not for documents which are specified
in the charge which is against the accused. Therefore, to allow the appellant
to go beyond these particulars would be to provide the accused with
knowledge of the means by which the prosecution proposed to prove the
alleged facts. That is not what s. 51A envisaged. Syed Abu Bakar Ahmad v. PP
[1981] 1 LNS 127 is a case which illustrates this point. The accused applied
for an order to inspect and make copies of all documents in the possession
of the prosecution. The accused contended that he would be gravely impaired
in preparing his defence without giving him an opportunity to have sight of
the documents. His application was dismissed by Seah J, who was of the
view that s. 51 of the CPC should be construed strictly and it does not allow
an accused to ask for discovery of documents or inspection of documents
seized by the police in the course of their investigation or in their possession
before the criminal trial because to do so would mean an inspection of the
evidence of the prosecution by the defence prior to the trial. Therefore, save
for the documents as provided under s. 51A of the CPC, the defence is not
entitled to ask for the disclosure or inspection of documents/materials in the
possession of the prosecution before the commencement of the trial.
[54] It is submitted by the respondent in the submission before us that the
application by the appellant does amount to a fishing expedition, thus the
generality of the documents applied for. This has been specifically addressed
by the Federal Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP where the Federal
Court said that:
[47] The appellant cannot say at this stage that his defence is going to
be so and so and that he needs to have access to such and such
documents and materials to prepare for his defence. One settled principle
attached to the application for discovery under s. 51 CPC is that, at this
pre trial stage, a roving and fishing inquiry for evidence is not permissible.
A catch all net cannot be cast. The appellant is not entitled to know by
what means the prosecution proposes to prove the facts underlying the
charge he faces. This remains the prerogative of the prosecution.

Conclusion

A

[55] Therefore, based on the aforesaid, the appellant is not entitled to be
supplied with the documents stipulated in paras. (1)(g), (h), (i), (j) and 2(i) in
the notice of motion.
[56] We find that the learned trial judge did not err in his findings that the
applicant has failed to establish a case for delivery of the information and
documents applied for. We unanimously dismissed the appeal by the
appellant and affirmed the decision of the learned High Court Judge.
