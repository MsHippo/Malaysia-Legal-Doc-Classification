LINTON ALBERT JCA
HAMID SULTAN ABU BACKER JCA
[CRIMINAL APPEAL NO: P-05-86-2011]
12 APRIL 2013
CRIMINAL LAW: Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971 - Section
3A - Appeal against sentence and decision - Whether accused disassociated
himself from principle offender - Mere denial of knowledge - Whether
elements of offence made out
This was an appeal by the appellant against his conviction under
s. 3A of the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971 (‘Act’) for
failing to show satisfactory disassociation from the accomplice (‘the
deceased’). The offences were alleged to have been committed on
14 January 2008 where the appellant and the deceased had
broken the glass display of a jewellery shop in order to steal
jewellery. During the said robbery, the deceased took out a gun
and shot several times upon which the appellant made no attempt
to stop the deceased. Eventually, the appellant was caught and
the deceased was shot dead by the police in a separate armed
robbery operation. It was the appellant’s defence that he had no
knowledge that the deceased was carrying a firearm and that he
would discharge shots.
Held (dismissing appeal; affirming conviction and sentence)
Per Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA delivering the judgment
of the court:
(1) One need not be the principal offender to be liable for the
offence under s. 3A of the Act and s. 34 of the Penal Code.
Association in the crime and failing to show satisfactory
disassociation from the crime or principal offender will attract
the charge as well as the sentence. (para 4)
(2) The learned trial judge had considered the appellant’s defence
in extenso. There was no evidence to suggest that the appellant
had disassociated himself from the act of the deceased in
discharging the firearm. The appellant did not leave the scene

after the first gun shot by the deceased but continued to pick
up the jewelleries during the whole tenure of subsequent
shots fired by the deceased. (paras 10 & 11)
(3) On the balance of probabilities, there was no evidence to
indicate that the appellant took reasonable steps to prevent
the discharge of the firearm by the deceased. Mere denial of
knowledge would not, per se, be sufficient to satisfy the
burden placed under s. 3A of the Act and relieve the accused
of the elements under s. 34 of the Penal Code. (para 12)

Ini adalah rayuan oleh perayu terhadap sabitan di bawah
s. 3A Akta Senjata Api (Penalti Lebih Berat) 1971 (‘Akta’) atas
kegagalan menunjukkan pemisahan yang memuaskan daripada rakan
sejenayah (‘si mati’). Kesalahan-kesalahan didakwa telah dilakukan
pada 14 Januari 2008 di mana perayu dan si mati telah
memecahkan cermin kaca sebuah kedai barang kemas untuk
mencuri barang kemas. Semasa rompakan, si mati telah
mengeluarkan pistol dan menembak beberapa kali yang mana
perayu tidak cuba untuk menghalang si mati. Akhirnya, perayu
telah ditangkap dan si mati telah ditembak mati oleh polis dalam
operasi rompakan bersenjata yang berasingan. Pembelaan perayu
adalah bahawa dia tidak mempunyai pengetahuan bahawa si mati
membawa senjata api bersama-samanya dan akan melepaskan
tembakan.

(1) Seseorang tidak perlu menjadi pesalah utama untuk
menanggung kesalahan di bawah s. 3A Akta dan s. 34 Kanun

penembakan senjata api. Perayu tidak meninggalkan tempat
kejadian selepas tembakan pertama oleh si mati tetapi terus
mengambil barang-barang kemas sepanjang tempoh tembakan
oleh si mati.
(3) Atas imbangan kebarangkalian, tidak ada keterangan yang
menunjukkan bahawa perayu telah mengambil langkah-langkah
yang munasabah untuk menghalang tembakan dilepaskan oleh
si mati. Penafian pengetahuan semata-mata tidak mencukupi
untuk memenuhi beban pembuktian yang diletakkan di bawah

Brief Facts
[2] The appellant and another accomplice named Jayakumar
(deceased) entered into a jewellery shop to rob on 14 January
2008. From the evidence of SP3 and SP5 it was clear that the
appellant and the deceased had broken the glass display in the
shop with a hammer and pocketed the jewellery into a bag. In
that process, the deceased took out a gun from his pocket and

had shot several times. There was no evidence to show that the
appellant made any attempt to stop the deceased from using the firearm
or disassociate himself from the deceased when the firearm was used
(emphasis added). After the robbery both ran out and the
appellant was caught and the deceased managed to escape.
Subsequently, on 27 March 2009 the deceased was shot dead by
the police in a separate armed robbery operation.
[3] The appellant was charged with two offences. One under
s. 3A of the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971 (‘FIPA
1971’) the other for robbery using a deadly weapon, ie, a
hammer. The appellant was found guilty of both the charges. On
the first charge he was sentenced to death. On the second charge
he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and ten strokes of
the rotan. The appellant is not appealing on the second charge
but only the first which reads as follows:
Bahawa kamu bersama-sama seorang lagi yang telah meninggal
dunia, pada 14 Januari 2008, jam lebih kurang 11.00 pagi, di
Kedai Emas Gayanthrii Tangga Maligai Jewellers, No. 42, Lebuh
Pasr, dalam Daerah Timur Laut, dalam Negeri Pulau Pinang,
telah melepaskan tembakan yang boleh menyebabkan kematian
semasa melakukan rompakan di mana kamu mengetahui rakan
sejenayah tersebut ada di bawah jagaan atau kawalannya senjata
api dan dengan itu kamu telah melakukan satu kesalahan di bawah
seksyen 3A Akta Senjatapi (Penalti Lebih Berat) 1971 yang boleh
dihukum di bawah seksyen yang sama dan dibaca bersama
seksyen 34 Kanun Keseksaan.

[4] What is important to note, under s. 3A FIPA 1971 and
s. 34 of the Penal Code which deals with common intention is
that one need not be the principal offender to be liable for the
offence. Association in the crime and failing to show satisfactory
disassociation from the crime or principal offender will attract the
charge as well as the sentence as per decided cases in this area
of jurisprudence. Section 3A FIPA 1971 reads as follows:
Where, with intent to cause death or hurt to any person, a
firearm is discharged by any person at the time of his committing
or attempting to commit or abetting the commission of a
scheduled offence, each of his accomplices in respect of the
offence present at the scene of the commission or attempted
commission or abetment thereof who may reasonably be presumed
to have known that such person was carrying or had in his



838

Current Law Journal

[2013] 8 CLJ

possession or under his custody or control the firearm shall,
notwithstanding that no hurt is caused by the discharge thereof,
be punished with death, unless he proves that he had taken all
reasonable steps to prevent the discharge.

Section 34 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

A

B

When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of
the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that
act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.

[5] It is well settled that for the prosecution to succeed in
relation to a charge under s. 3A of the FIPA 1971 it has to
establish five essential elements of the offence, namely:

C

(i) The said scheduled offence was committed;
(ii) The accused was an accomplice;

D

(iii) The accused was present at the scene of the robbery;
(iv) The firearm was discharged within the meaning of s. 2 of
FIPA 1971; and
E

(v) The accused may reasonably be presumed to have known
that the person who discharged the firearm was carrying the
same (emphasis added). The burden to disprove is one on the
balance of probabilities as imposed by s. 3A FIPA 1971.
[6] In PP v. Choo Chuan Wang [1992] 2 CLJ 1242; [1992] 3
CLJ (Rep) 329 Edgar Joseph Jr J (as he then was) had this to
say:
Thus, the onus is passed to the accused to prove, on the
balance of probabilities that he had taken all reasonable steps
to prevent the discharge of the firearm concerned. (emphasis
added). However, the accused’s bare denial that he was a party
to the robbery and his conduct at the scene of the crime could
not possibly discharge the onus which lay upon him.

[7] Having said that, it must be noted that s. 34 does not
provide such a high burden on the accused. However, there must
be some evidence at the trial either at prosecution stage or
defence stage to show that the accused at the time of the incident
had disassociated from the criminal act to be relieved from s. 34.
For example, if several persons have joined hands to assault a

person by hand and suddenly one of the accomplice takes a knife
to assault, any accomplice who attempts to stop the other from
using the knife or moves away from the incident will not be
charged for murder or culpable homicide in the event the knife
was used to kill the victim. The only offence at all the accomplice
may face is for assault. (See Joginder Ahir and Ors v. State of Bihar
AIR 1971 SC 1834).
[8] The difference between s. 3A FIPA 1971 and s. 34 inter alia
is that the threshold burden for the prosecution to establish the
case is low and the burden to disprove the case for the accused
is on the balance of probabilities (high threshold). However, when
s. 34 is relied on the threshold burden is high for the prosecution
and burden on the defence is low, ie, need not disprove on the
balance of probabilities, and it will be sufficient if the defence cast
a reasonable doubt. Further, the existence of a common intention
among the participants in a crime is the essential element for the
application of s. 34 and in the absence of such common intention,
the section has no application. (See Ashok Kumar v. State of
Punjab AIR 1977 SC 109). It is also well settled in relation to s.
34 that at times it is difficult if not impossible to procure direct
evidence to prove the intention of an individual. In most cases it
has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant
circumstances of the case. (see Suresh v. State of UP AIR 2001
SCC 1344). On similar note the position under s. 3A FIPA 1971
is not only the same but the threshold for the prosecution to
satisfy this requirement is placed much lower than s. 34.
[9] In the instant case, the learned judge had meticulously dealt
with the elements of the offence at the prosecution stage and
made a finding that the elements of the offence had been
established. That part of the judgment reads as follows:
Adalah juga sukar bagi Mahkamah ini membayangkan Tertuduh
tidak mengetahui bahawa rakan sejenayahnya memiliki pistol ketika
itu apabila menurut SP5, beliau mendengar tembakan pertama
sejurus selepas Tertuduh memecahkan cermin-cermin tempat
pameran apabila rakan sejenayah beliau memasuki kedai emas
tersebut tanpa sesiapa mencabar atau melontarkan apa-apa
peralatan ke arah mereka berdua. Tambahan pula, selepas
tembakan pertama tersebut, Tertuduh bukan sahaja tidak melarikan
diri atau menahan rakan sejenayahnya dari melepaskan tembakan,
malah sepanjang tempoh tembakan kedua dan ketiga oleh rakan



840

[2013] 8 CLJ

sejenayahnya (menurut SP3 terdapat 3-4 kali tembakan). Tertuduh
masih terus mengutip barang-barang kemas dan memasukkan ke
dalam beg yang beliau bawa dan juga sebagaimana terbukti
kemudiannya, di dalam pouch bag beliau.

[10] The appellant has filed a lengthy memorandum of appeal on
issues of facts and pleads that if the deceased was alive his
evidence would have been corroborated ie, to say that he had no
knowledge the gun was carried by the accused. The learned trial
judge had written a lengthy judgment and had considered the
defence in extenso. It is not in dispute during the defence stage the
appellant had conceded to going to the jewellery shop to rob.
That part of the evidence reads as follows:
Mengenai pertuduhan kedua terhadap saya, saya mengakui bahawa
pada 14.1.2007 jam lebih kurang 11.00 pagi tersebut, saya
sememangnya ada pergi ke kedai emas Gayanthrii No. 42, Lebuh
Pasar, Pulau Pinang bersama Ramu tetapi tidak mengetahui yang
Ramu mempunyai pistol dan bertujuan akan melepaskan tembakan
pistol tersebut. Semasa di dalam kedai tersebut, saya tidak melihat
siapa sebenarnya yang melepaskan tembakan. Saya hanya dengar
bunyi tembakan dari arah belakang saya mendengar sebegitu. Saya
terus berlari keluar.

[11] There is no evidence to suggest that the appellant
disassociated from the act of the deceased in discharging the
firearm. In fact, evidence from PW3 shows that the appellant did
not leave the scene after the first gun shot by the deceased but
he instead continued to pick up the jewelleries during the whole
tenure of subsequent shots fired by the deceased. That part of
the evidence during cross-examination reads as follows:

F

Put: Apabila lelaki India lain tersebut menembak pertama kalinya,
Tertuduh terus melarikan diri daripada kedai kamu.

G

J: Tidak, Tertuduh tidak lari semasa tembakan pertama
tersebut.

Further PW3 in re-examination went on to say as follows:

H

… Saya hanya ingat lelaki yang menembak tersebut bercakap
kepada Tertuduh yang bermakna ‘kita keluar’ atau ‘Kilambuda’
dalam Tamil yang bermaksud ‘kita keluar’.

Semasa lelaki India yang menembak tersebut melepaskan tembakan

[12] We have read the appeal record and the memorandum of
appeal in detail. We could not find any evidence to show on the
balance of probabilities that the appellant had taken all reasonable
steps to prevent the discharge of the said firearm by the deceased.
Mere denial of knowledge would not per se be sufficient to satisfy
the burden placed under s. 3A FIPA 1971. Mere denial also will
not be sufficient to relieve the accused of the elements of s. 34
of the Penal Code.
[13] In conclusion we find the appeal has no merits. The appeal
is dismissed and we affirm the decision of the High Court.
