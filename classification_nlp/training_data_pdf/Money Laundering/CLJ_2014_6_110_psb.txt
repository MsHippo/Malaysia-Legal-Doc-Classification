Azmi Osman v. PP

111

The appellant was said to be involved in corrupt practices of
receiving bribes. It was alleged that the appellant had an
unaccounted source of income totalling about RM9,481,414,18.
The appellant appealed against the conviction and sentence under
ss. 55(1) and 61(2) of the Act. The trial judge (‘the judge’) had
earlier acquitted the appellant at the end of the prosecution case
on 7 January 2011. The respondent (‘the prosecution’) appealed
against the decision of acquittal (‘the first appeal’) whereby the
High Court allowed the appeal and ordered the appellant to enter
his defence on 29 November 2011. The trial judge convicted the
appellant at the end of the defence and ordered a third party
notice to be issued in respect of the appellant’s properties which
were seized earlier on 27 August 2012 under s. 55(1) read with
s. 61(2) of the Act. The appellant thus appealed to the High
Court (‘the second appeal’) against the conviction and the order
of the third party notice under ss. 55 and 61 of the Act. A
preliminary issue was raised as to whether the High Court in the
second appeal could re-evaluate the decision made by the High
Court in the first appeal that a prima facie case against the
appellant had been made out on all the charges and that the
appellant was to enter his defence. The respondent submitted that
as a general rule, there was no necessity for the High Court in
the second appeal to ‘re-evaluate’ the decision made by the High
Court in the first appeal that a prima facie case against the
accused had been made out on all the charges unless there was
fresh evidence raised by the appellant which could cast a
reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case. The appellant on the
other hand submitted that an appeal was filed against conviction
and sentence after the case had been fully disposed of at the
court below and therefore the High Court in the second appeal
should determine on reviewing the whole case, whether or not the
defence ought to have been called (whether prosecution had made
out a ‘prima facie case’).
Held (allowing appeal against conviction and sentence;
dismissing appeal against issuance of notice under
s. 61(2) of the Act):
(1) The High Court in hearing the second appeal, had the power
to re-evaluate whether the prosecution had established a prima
facie case at the end of the prosecution case. The High Court
in the first appeal was standing in the shoes of the trial judge
in deciding whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution



112

Current Law Journal

[2014] 6 CLJ

in the court below had established a prima facie case which
was overlooked by the trial judge. When the High Court in
the first appeal decided that there was a prima facie case
established at the end of the prosecution case and ordered
the accused to enter his defence, it is settled law that the
decision was not appealable by the accused as his right had
not been finally determined and he could file an appeal only
at the end of the full trial that is, after he was found guilty
and convicted. Hence, the order of the High Court in the
first appeal to call the accused to enter his defence shall be
treated as that of the trial judge which could be re-evaluated
by the High Court in the second appeal. The duty of the
High Court in the second appeal was to ensure that all rulings
made at the trial court were in accordance with the evidence
adduced. If any ruling or order was made against the weight
of evidence, the High Court in the second appeal had the
power to correct a miscarriage of justice on appeal.
(para 22)
(2) To constitute an offence under s. 4(1) of the Act, the
prosecution must prove the following elements against the
accused: (i) that the accused had received or used the monies
(‘the first element’); that the monies received or used were the
proceeds of an unlawful activity (‘the second element’). To
prove the proceeds of an unlawful activity, the prosecution
must prove the commission of a serious offence known as the
predicate offence specified in the second schedule and the
monies specified in the charges are the proceeds of the serious
offence; and (iii) once these elements are proven, it could be
inferred from the objective factual circumstances that the
accused knew or had reason to believe, that the monies were
the proceeds from any unlawful activity or in respect of the
conduct of a natural person, the accused without reasonable
excuse failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether or
not the property was proceeds from an unlawful activity
(‘the third element’). (para 26)
(3) The circumstantial evidence in this case was not sufficient to
constitute a prima facie proof of the second element of the
offence that is, the monies in the bank accounts were
proceeds from unlawful activities. It is trite law that where
prosecution is relying on circumstantial evidence, the onus

upon it is a very heavy one and that evidence must point
irresistibly to the guilt of the accused. If there are gaps in it
then that will not be sufficient. The circumstantial evidence
adduced by the prosecution failed to satisfy the beyond
reasonable doubt test. The High Court Judge had erred in
law and in fact in holding that the prosecution had established
a prima facie case in respect of the four charges against the
appellant. The defence ought not have been called in the first
place: PP v. Lin Lian Chen (refd); Sunny Ang v. PP (refd).
(para 45)

(4) The procedure of forfeiture of property upon prosecution for
an offence under s. 55(1) is civil in nature and the standard
of proof required is that of the balance of probabilities and not
that of beyond reasonable doubt. The burden is always on the
prosecution to prove that the properties which are liable to be
forfeited are the subject matters of the offence that is, under
s. 4(1) of the Act. (para 64)
(5) In interpreting the phrase ‘subject matter of the offence’ under
s. 55(1) of the Act, it should be interpreted broadly to include
not only the properties specified in the charges but also all
those properties seized under ss. 50 and 51 of the Act.
(para 68)
(6) In order to forfeit the properties under s. 55(1) the Act, the
court had to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that
(i) the said properties were in fact the subject matters of the
offence; (ii) the accused was not the true and lawful owner of
the properties; and (iii) no other person was entitled for the
property as a purchaser in good faith for valuable
consideration. (para 68)
(7) The circumstantial evidence in totality constituted sufficient
proof on the balance of probabilities that the proceeds found
in the bank accounts stated in the charges as well as all the
other properties seized in respect of the money laundering
offence under ss. 50 and 51 of the Act were proceeds of an
unlawful activity which constitute the subject matters of the
offence and the appellant was not the true and lawful owner
of such properties. Hence, the trial judge had rightly issued the
notice to show cause under s. 61(2) of the Act. (paras 71

JUDGMENT
Teo Say Eng JC:
Background
[1] This is an appeal by the appellant (the accused) against the
conviction and sentence and order issued by the trial judge
(Sessions Court Judge) under ss. 55(1) and 61(2) of the
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001
(hereinafter to be referred to as “the Act”).
[2] Prior to the commencement of this appeal, the trial judge has
acquitted the appellant at the end of the prosecution case on
7 January 2011.
[3] The respondent (the prosecution) appealed against the
decision of acquittal whereby the High Court (hereinafter to be
referred to as the High Court in the first appeal) allowed the
appeal and ordered the appellant to enter his defence on
29 November 2011.

[4] The trial judge convicted the appellant at the end of the
defence and ordered a third party notice to be issued in respect
of the appellant’s properties which were seized earlier on 27 August
2012 under s. 55(1) to be read with s. 61(2) of the Act.
[5] The appellant hence appealed to the High Court (hereinafter
to be referred to as the High Court in the second appeal) against
conviction and the order of the third party notice under ss. 55
and 61 of the Act.
Preliminary Issue For Determination
[6] The preliminary issue raised during the appeal before this
court is whether the High Court in the second appeal may reevaluate the decision made by the High Court in the first appeal
that a prima facie case against the appellant had been made out
on all the charges and ordered the appellant to enter his defence.
Respondent’s Submission (Prosecution)

E

F

G

H

I

[7] The respondent submits that as a general rule, there is no
necessity for the High Court in the second appeal to ‘re-evaluate’
the decision made by the High Court in the first appeal that a
prima facie case against the accused had been made out on all the
charges unless there was fresh evidence raised by the appellant
which could cast a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.
[8] The respondent relied on the Court of Appeal case of PP
lwn. Sulaiman Saidin [2010] 1 CLJ 184; at p. 194, para. 16 and
at p. 197, para. 27 to support its contention.
[9] The respondent further submits that the learned High
Court Judge in the first appeal in his grounds of judgment
(dated 29 November 2011) had discussed at length as to why
the appellant was ordered to enter his defence after finding that a
‘prima facie’ case had been made out by the prosecution.
[10] The respondent therefore submits that His Lordship had
made the decision based on the correct principles of law, that is,
by referring to the Federal Court case of Balachandran v. PP
[2005] 1 CLJ 85 and the Court of Appeal case of Looi Kow Chai
& Anor v. PP [2003] 1 CLJ 734.

Appellant’s Submission (Accused)

A

[11] The appellant submits that an appeal was filed against
conviction and sentence after this case has been fully disposed of
at the court below.
[12] This court now shall determine on reviewing the whole case,
whether or not the defence ought to be called (whether
prosecution has made out a “prima facie case”).
[13] The court is hearing this appeal by the way of re-hearing. It
is imperative for the court to look at the prosecution’s evidence
again as decided in Balachandran v. PP (supra).

B

C

[14] The appellant has constitutional rights to have two automatic
rights of appeal.
[15] In the earlier appeal by the prosecution, the accused was
the respondent.
[16] Section 50 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 clearly
stipulates an automatic two-tier appeals for cases heard from
Sessions Courts.

D

E

[17] The accused is entitled to be acquitted at the end of
prosecution case, hence it goes without saying he has the right to
appeal (twice) against any such order wrongly made.
[18] The appellant submits that there were instances where the
Court of Appeal ruled that earlier Court of Appeal ought not to
have called for the defence in cases where High Court sits as trial
court.
[19] The appellant cited the Court of Appeal case of Jaferi Ipee
v. PP [2013] 3 CLJ 381; [2013] 3 MLJ 467, where the High
Court had acquitted the accused at the end of prosecution case.
The prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal which ordered
the accused to enter his defence. At the end of the defence, the
accused was convicted by the High Court. The accused appealed
to the Court of Appeal wherein the central issue was the
identification of the accused by the prosecution’s witness. This
same issue though was again raised, it was considered again by
the Court of Appeal hearing the accused’s appeal.

[20] The appellant submits that the court hearing this appeal (the
High Court in the second appeal) has the power to correct any
miscarriage of justice if the prima facie ruling was so made against
the weight of evidence by the High Court in the first appeal.
[21] The decision made by the High Court in the first appeal
does not bind the High Court in the second appeal as both the
High Courts are at the same level of jurisdiction.
Ruling Of The Court

C

D

E

F

G

H

I

[22] Having carefully considered the submissions and the cases
cited by the respective parties I am of the considered view that
this court in hearing the appellant’s appeal against conviction and
sentence after he was ordered to enter his defence by the High
Court in the first appeal and was found guilty and convicted after
his defence by the trial court, has the power to re-evaluate
whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case at the
end of the prosecution case for the following reasons:
(a) The High Court in the first appeal when hearing an appeal by
the prosecution against acquittal was standing in the shoes of
the trial judge in deciding whether the evidence adduced by
the prosecution at the court below had established a prima
facie case which was overlooked by the trial judge. When the
High Court in the first appeal decided that there was a prima
facie case established at the end of the prosecution case and
ordered the accused to enter his defence it is settled law that
the decision is not appealable by the accused as his right has
not been finally determined and he could file an appeal only
at the end of the full trial that is, after he was found guilty
and convicted.
In the above circumstances I am of the view that the order
of the High Court in the first appeal to call the accused to
enter his defence shall be treated as that of the trial judge
which could be re-evaluated by the High Court in the second
appeal against conviction and sentence by the appellant.
(b) What is more pertinent is that it is the duty of the High Court
in the second appeal in hearing an appeal from the Sessions
Court against conviction and sentence after the defence case
is to ensure that all rulings made at the trial court are in
accordance with the evidence adduced. If any ruling or order



118

Current Law Journal

[2014] 6 CLJ

is made against the weight of evidence, the High Court in the
second appeal has the power to correct a miscarriage of
justice on appeal. This view finds support in the Court of
Appeal case of Jaferi Ipee v. PP [2013] 3 CLJ 381; [2013]
3 MLJ 407 where the facts are similar to our case here. In
that case when the Court of Appeal in the earlier appeal had
called for the accused to enter his defence, it must be taken
that the prosecution had sufficiently proved the identity of the
accused as one of the assailants who had caused the death
of the deceased. When the accused was found guilty and
convicted after he had entered his defence, he appealed
against the conviction to the Court of Appeal. The central
issue in the subsequent appeal was the identification of the
accused which was considered again in the Court of Appeal.
However the prosecution has relied on another Court of
Appeal’s case of PP lwn. Sulaiman Saidin [2010] 1 CLJ 184
to say that there is no necessity for a subsequent appellate
court to re-evaluate the prima facie ruling made by the earlier
Court of Appeal in ordering the accused to enter his defence
unless there is new evidence raised by the defence which
could cast doubt in the prosecution’s case.
It is to be noted that Sulaiman Saidin’s case can be
distinguished from our present case that in the former case,
no grounds of judgment was prepared by the earlier Court of
Appeal in calling for the defence, so the subsequent Court of
Appeal had ruled that there was no necessity to re-evaluate
the prima facie ruling made by the earlier Court of Appeal in
the absence of any fresh evidence which could cast a
reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. Whereas in the
present case, the learned High Court Judge in the first appeal
has written his grounds of judgment and has analysed the
evidence adduced by the prosecution at the end of the
prosecution case.
I am still of the considered view that the stand taken by the
Court of Appeal in Jaferi’s case is to be preferred. I am
therefore of the considered view that the High Court in the
second appeal could, even in the absence of any additional
evidence raised by the accused, re-evaluate the earlier High
Court decision in calling for the defence to cure a miscarriage
of justice if the prima facie ruling was made against the weight
of evidence.

Whether The High Court In The First Appeal Erred In Law And In
Fact In Ordering The Appellant To Enter His Defence
[23] Having determined that this court has the power to reevaluate the prima facie ruling made by the High Court in the first
appeal I shall now proceed to determine whether the High Court
in the first appeal had erred in law and in fact in ordering the
appellant to enter his defence.

The Law
[25] Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and AntiTerrorism Financing Act 2001 (Act 613) reads as follows: Any person
who:

F

(a) engages in, or attempts to engage in; or
(b) abets the commission of,
money laundering, commits an offence and shall on conviction be
liable to a fine not exceeding RM5 million or to imprisonment for
a term not exceeding five years or to both.
The interpretation of “money laundering” under s. 3(1) of the Act
is as follows:

G

H

“money laundering” means the act of a person who:
(a) engages, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that involves
proceeds of any unlawful activity;
(b) acquires, receives, possesses, disguises, transfers, converts,
exchanges, carries, disposes, uses, removes from or brings
into Malaysia proceeds of any unlawful activity; or

I



[2014] 6 CLJ
A

Azmi Osman v. PP

121

(c) conceals, disguises or impedes the establishment of the true
nature, origin, location, movement, disposition, title of, rights
with respect to, or ownership of, proceeds of any unlawful
activity;
where:

B

(aa) as may be inferred from objective factual circumstance, the
person knows or has reason to believe, that the property is
proceeds from any unlawful activity; or
C

D

(bb) in respect of the conduct of a natural person, the person
without reasonable excuse fails to take reasonable steps to
ascertain whether or not the property is proceeds from any
unlawful activity.

[26] To constitute an offence under s. 4(1) of the Act the
prosecution must therefore prove the following elements against
the accused:
(a) the accused has received or used (according to the charge)
the monies (first element);

E

F

(b) The monies received or used are the proceeds of an unlawful
activity (second element). To prove the proceeds of an
unlawful activity, the prosecution must prove the commission
of a serious offence known as the predicate offence specified
in the Second Schedule and the monies specified in the
charges are the proceeds of the serious offence. It is to be
noted that s. 4(2) allows a person to be convicted of money
laundering offence irrespective of whether or not he has been
convicted of the offence that generated the money (the
predicated offence under Schedule 2 of Act).

G

H

(c) Once the above elements are proven, it could be inferred from
the objective factual circumstance that the accused knows or
has reason to believe, that the monies are the proceeds from
any unlawful activity or in respect of the conduct of a natural
person, the accused without reasonable excuse fails to take
reasonable steps to ascertain whether or not the property is
proceeds from an unlawful activity (third element).

[27] It is not disputed by the appellant that the first element of
the offence in respect of all the four charges has been proven by
the respondent (the prosecution) that is, all the monies that were

banked into the appellant’s Maybank Mentakab account through
the cash deposit and ATM machines at Lumut, Sitiawan in
respect of the first and second charges and all the monies were
deposited by the appellant’s wife Puan Maznah into the
appellant’s Maybank account in Johor Bahru in respect of the
third and the fourth charges.

A

B

Whether Second Element Proven
[28] The crux of the appellant’s contention is that the
prosecution had failed to adduce prima facie evidence on the
second element of the offence as per the four charges that is, the
monies in the accused’s Maybank accounts were proceeds from
the illegal activities.

C

Appellant’s Submission
D

[29] The prosecution failed to prove the second element of the
offence, to wit, the monies which were banked into the appellant’s
Maybank accounts were proceeds from illegal activities for the
following reasons:
(a) There is no presumption under the Act that any money which
cannot be accounted for shall be presumed to be proceeds
from illegal activities.

E

It is the duty of the prosecution to prove affirmatively that
the monies found in the appellant’s Maybank accounts were
proceeds from illegal activities.

F

The appellant submits that the prosecution should have called
Puan Maznah who had deposited the monies in the Johor
Bahru Maybank account to explain the source of the monies.
An adverse inference should be drawn by the court on failure
to call the said witness to testify in court.

G

(b) The prosecution only relied on the evidence of SP19, SP20
and SP21 to prove that the monies found in the two
Maybank accounts were proceeds from the illegal activities.

H

The evidence adduced through SP19, SP20 and SP21 may be
summarized as follows:
(i) The evidence established at the court below is that SP19
acted as ‘orang tengah untuk kutip wang untuk accused.’
Whereas SP20 said he was an illegal lottery operator and
he paid RM1,500 per month to the appellant through

I



[2014] 6 CLJ
A

Azmi Osman v. PP

123

SP21 to ensure that his business was not disturbed. He
said he only paid for two years. After that he stopped
paying because SP21 told him that the appellant was
transferred and no longer in charge of the place of
gambling.

B

C

(ii) SP21 said he was operating some gambling machines in
1999 or 2000. He was introduced by SP19 to the
appellant. SP21 said he would take the money from SP20
(RM1,500) including his own money (RM3,000) and put
them in an envelope and gave it to the appellant for every
meeting he had with the appellant.
(iii) All this happened in 1999 and/or 2000 and 2001.

D

[30] The appellant submits that the High Court in the first appeal
had erred in law and in fact in accepting the evidence of SP19,
SP20 and SP21 for the following reasons:
(i) SP19, SP20 to SP21 were in fact accomplices and their
evidence was not corroborated;

E

F

G

(ii) Their evidence was full of inconsistencies and was therefore
not reliable; and
(iii) Their evidence was previous bad character evidence of the
appellant which was not related to the time and dates stated
in the four charges and should be rejected by the court.
[31] The appellant further submits that even if the court were to
accept the evidence of SP19, SP20 and SP21, the date of
payment of the monies by the SP20 and SP21 to the appellant
started in 1999 and stopped in 2001 and was too far apart from
the dates of the offence stated in the four charges against the
appellant.

H

[32] The appellant further submits that it is not proven that the
monies purportedly paid by SP20 and SP21 for two years were
banked into the appellant’s account let alone which particular
account of the appellant.

I

[33] For the above reasons, the appellant submits that the High
Court in the first appeal erred in law and in fact in ruling that the
prosecution has established a prime facie case by failing to subject
the prosecution evidence to a maximum evaluation test and the
said ruling was made against the weight of the evidence.

Respondent’s Submission (Prosecution)

A

[34] The respondent submits that the High Court in the first
appeal has rightly ruled that the prosecution has established a
prima facie case and ordered the appellant to enter his defence
based on the following evidence adduced at the court below:

B

(a) The prosecution had adduced evidence through SP19, SP20
and SP21 that the appellant had received the proceeds from
the illegal activities amounting to RM30,000 or more;
(b) It has also been proven through the bank staffs that is, SP8,
SP9, SP10, SP15 and SP16 the following sums of monies had
been paid into the two Maybank accounts belonging to the
appellant:
(i) RM2,085,300;

C

D

(ii) RM679,850;
(iii) RM941,930;
(iv) RM250,000.
(c) Evidence has also been adduced through SP3 ASP Wan
Mustafa on the salary of the appellant which was paid into the
appellant’s CIMB’s account which does not commensurate
with the huge amounts of cash found in his two Maybank
accounts;
(d) One Executive Officer from SSM Johor, SP4 Encik Azrin bin
Mohd Ripin had testified from the records of SSM that the
appellant was not involved in carrying out any form of
business activities. Neither was he a director of any company;
(e) SP24 a forensic officer from the forensic branch Ibu Pejabat
BPR Putrajaya told the court he had prepared a ‘Laporan
Forensik Perakaunan’ (exh. P98) which reveals that the
appellant had an unknown source of income of about
RM9,481,414.18 without taking into account his alleged
commission from Shah.
[35] The prosecution submits that the High Court in the first
appeal has carefully evaluated the evidence adduced at the court
below and had correctly applied the principles of law to the facts
as found and ruled that the prosecution had established a prima
facie case on all the four charges against the appellant.

Ruling Of The Court On The Second Element
[36] It is the duty of the prosecution to prove the second
element of the offence against the appellant beyond reasonable
doubt. There is no presumption of law or fact as to what
constitutes “monies or proceeds from unlawful activities” under the
Act. The prosecution has to adduce evidence, direct or
circumstantial to prove that the monies in the two Maybank
accounts are proceeds from the unlawful activities. Once it is
proven that the monies in the appellant’s Maybank accounts are
proceeds from unlawful activities the prosecution may invoke
(i) s. 3(1)(aa) to infer from the objective factual circumstances,
that the appellant knew or had reasons to believe that the
property was proceeds from the unlawful activity or (ii) s. 3(i)(bb)
that in respect of the conduct of a natural person, the person
(the appellant) without reasonable excuse failed to take reasonable
steps to ascertain whether or not the property was the proceeds
from any unlawful activity.
[37] I have perused the findings of the High Court Judge in the
first appeal in his grounds of judgment and the evidence adduced
pertaining to the second element of the offence at the court
below. I find that the learned High Court Judge had relied on the
evidence of SP19, SP20 and SP21 who were alleged to be
accomplices to prove the second element of the offence.
[38] I agree with the contention of the appellant that SP19,
SP20 and SP21 were accomplices whose evidence must be
corroborated by credible evidence. However the law permits the
court to convict on the evidence of an accomplice in the absence
of corroborating evidence if it feels safe to do so and to decide
on the weight to be given to such evidence: See s. 133 of the
Evidence Act 1950.

H

[39] Having reviewed the evidence of SP19, SP20 and SP21, I
find that it is safe to rely on their evidence since there were no
criminal charges pending against them at the time they testified in
court and they had nothing to gain by testifying against the
appellant.

I

[40] I also find that the contention of the appellant that the
evidence of SP19, SP20 and SP21 is tantamount to evidence of
bad character of the appellant is totally without merit. First, I am
of the view that whether the monies received by the appellant



126

Current Law Journal

[2014] 6 CLJ

were proceeds of unlawful activity is a fact in issue and is relevant
to the charge. It does not matter that the monies received by the
appellant from SP20 and SP21 were earlier than the dates stated
in the charges so long as the prosecution could prove the link of
the corrupt monies to the monies in the two Maybank accounts.

A

B

[41] I therefore find that the learned High Court Judge in the first
appeal has correctly relied upon the evidence of SP19, SP20 and
SP21 to prove the second element of the offence.
[42] The next question arises is whether the evidence of SP19,
SP20 and SP21 that the appellant had received a certain sum of
corrupt monies for two years prior to the dates of the charges is
sufficient to constitute prima facie proof that the monies found in
the two Maybank accounts belonging to the accused were
proceeds of unlawful activities.
[43] Having reviewed the evidence adduced, I find that the
learned High Court Judge in the first appeal had erred in fact and
in law in ruling that “apabila terbuktinya yang wang-wang yang
dimaksudkan itu telah diterima oleh responden (tertuduh) melalui
akaun yang dimaksudkan itu, makanya bebanan adalah tertanggung
di pihak responden untuk menjelaskan tentang kedudukan serta
status wang-wang tersebut sama ada ianya adalah merupakan hasil
daripada aktiviti judi ekor haram yang diperolehi oleh responden
daripada ketiga-tiga saksi tersebut.” I find that the learned High
Court Judge had committed two errors in his grounds of
judgment, that is, one is that his finding of prima facie case is
made against the weight of evidence and two, his finding on the
burden of proof was incorrect as there is no legal burden on the
part of the appellant to explain that the monies which he received
from SP19, SP20 and SP21 were not proceeds from illegal
activities. The burden to prove the offence beyond reasonable
doubt is always on the prosecution and it never shifts throughout
the trial. The only duty of the appellant after the defence is called
is either to create any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case
or to rebut the inference invoked under s. 3(1)(aa) or (bb) of the
Act on the balance of probabilities.
[44] As regards his finding of facts, I find that there is no direct
evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove that the illegal
proceeds collected from SP20 and SP21 were paid into the
Maybank accounts. The only question arises here is whether the
evidence adduced (circumstantial) is sufficient for the trial judge to

C

Azmi Osman v. PP

127

come to the conclusion that the monies collected from SP20 and
SP21 were banked into the appellant’s Maybank accounts.
However I am satisfied that the prosecution has established the
following circumstantial evidence:
(i) Substantial sums of monies amounting to RM3,957,080 were
banked into the Maybank accounts belonging to the appellant;
(ii) The appellant had received a certain sum of corrupt monies
for about two years from SP20 and SP21 prior to the dates
stated in the four charges;
(iii) His income as a police officer was around RM4,000 per
month and he was not involved in any form of business and
had no other source of income;

D

E

F

G

H

I

(iv) Laporan Forensik Perakaunan prepared by SP24 reveals that
the appellant had an unaccounted source of income totalling
about RM9,481,414.18 without taking into account his alleged
commission from Shah.
[45] I am of the considered view that the sum total of the above
circumstantial evidence is still not sufficient to constitute a prima
facie proof of the second element of the offence that is, the
monies in the Maybank accounts were proceeds from the unlawful
activities because there was no link that the corrupt monies
collected from SP20 and SP21 were actually banked into his
Maybank Accounts.
[46] The law on circumstantial evidence is that: It is trite law
that where prosecution is relying on circumstantial evidence, the
onus upon it is a very heavy one and that evidence must point
irresistibly to the guilt of the accused. If there are gaps in it then
that will not be sufficient: PP v. Lin Lian Chen [1992] 4 CLJ 2086;
[1992] 1 CLJ (Rep) 285; [1992] 2 MLJ 561; Sunny Ang v. PP
[1965] 1 LNS 171; [1966] 2 MLJ 195.
[47] In fact the irresistible conclusion test was synonymous with
the standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt as was held by
our Federal Court in Jayaraman Velayuthan v. PP [1982] CLJ 464;
[1982] CLJ (Rep) 130; [1982] 2 MLJ 306.
[48] Applying the principles relating to the circumstantial evidence
to the facts of the case, I find that the circumstantial evidence
adduced by the prosecution has failed to satisfy the beyond
reasonable doubt test.



Current Law Journal

128

[2014] 6 CLJ

[49] For the above reasons, I find the learned High Court Judge
had erred in law and in fact in holding that the prosecution has
established a prima facie case in respect of the four charges against
the appellant. I am therefore of the view that the defence ought
not to be called in the first place. I allowed the appeal against the
conviction and sentence in respect of the four charges. I hereby
set aside the finding of guilt and conviction and sentence by the
trial judge and acquitted and discharged the appellant of all the
four charges.
The Defence

A

B

C

[50] I shall now proceed to consider the defence put forward by
the appellant on the assumption that a prima facie case has been
established by the respondent (prosecution).
[51] I have perused the findings of the trial judge in her grounds
of judgment and the defence adduced by the appellant. I find that
she has carefully considered the evidence of each defence witness
and the documents tendered by the defence.

D

[52] She has dealt with each document and held that they were
of no evidential value and she has given her reasons for her
findings. The trial judge held that the appellant’s story that he had
received RM6.25 million just by introducing customers to Shah
was not reasonable and unbelievable. I find that she has correctly
applied the principles of law to the facts as found.

E

F

[53] All considered, I find that the court below has rightly
rejected the defence and ruled that it has failed to create any
reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.
On Forfeiture Of Property Upon Prosecution For An
Offence Law
[54] The law governing forfeiture of property upon prosecution of
an offence is laid under s. 55 to be read with s. 61 of the Act
which may be summarised as follows:
(i) Section 55(1) provides two situations in any prosecution for
an offence under s. 4(1), where the court shall make an order
for the forfeiture of any property which is proved to be the
subject matter of the offence or to have been used in the
commission of the offence ... where:
(a) the offence is proved against the accused; or

G

H

I



[2014] 6 CLJ
A

Azmi Osman v. PP

129

(b) the offence is not proved against the accused but the
court is satisfied:
(i) that the accused is not the true and lawful owner of
such property; and

B

(ii) that no other person is entitled to the property as a
purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration;

C

(ii) In determining whether the property is the subject matter of
the offence ... the court shall apply the standard of proof in
civil proceedings.

D

[55] In the case before us, since I have ruled that the
prosecution has failed to prove the four charges under s. 4(1) of
the Act against the appellant the procedure of forfeiture falls under
the second situation stipulated in s. 55(1) of the Act.
[56] Under the second situation, the court shall make an order
of forfeiture if the following requirements can be satisfied on the
balance of probabilities:

E

(i) the property concerned must be the subject matter of the
offence;
(ii) the accused is not the true and lawful owner of the property;

F

G

H

(iii) No other person is entitled to the property as a purchaser in
good faith for valuable consideration.
[57] Once the above requirements have been proved on the
balance of probabilities, the court shall then issue a third party
notice by way of gazette calling upon any third party who claims
to have any interest in the property to attend before the court on
the date specified in the notice to show cause as to why the
property shall not be forfeited: Section 61(2).
[58] The court shall return the property to the third party when
it is satisfied that:
(i) The claimant is a purchaser in good faith for valuable
consideration;
(ii) The claimant has a legitimate legal interest in the property;

I

(iii) No participation, conclusion or involvement with respect to
the offence under sub-s. 4(1) which is the object of the
proceedings can be imputed to the claimant;



130

Current Law Journal

[2014] 6 CLJ

(iv) The claimant lacked knowledge and was not intentionally
ignorant of the illegal use of the property, or if he had
knowledge did not freely consent to its illegal use;
(v) The claimant did not acquire any right in the property from a
person proceeded against under circumstances that give rise to
a reasonable inference that any right was transferred for the
purpose of avoiding the eventual subsequent forfeiture of the
property; and
(vi) The claimant did all that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the illegal use of the property: See s. 55(1)(b)(ii) and
s. 61(4) of the Act.

A

B

C

[59] When the third party fails to satisfy any of the above
requirements, the court shall forfeit the said property.
D

Issues For Determination
[60] The main contention of the appellant is that the prosecution
must prove on the balance of probabilities that the properties
concerned are the subject matters of the offence. The appellant
submits that the subject matter of the offence stated in s. 55(1)
should only be confined to those properties specified in the four
charges and should not be extended to those properties seized
under ss. 50 and 51 of the Act, namely: exhs. P100-P112.
[61] The burden of proof is still on the prosecution to prove that
the monies specified in the four charges are proceeds of unlawful
activities on the balance of probabilities. The appellant submits
that the prosecution has failed to prove the monies in the
Maybank accounts were in fact proceeds of crime on the balance
of probabilities. Neither was there evidence to show that the
properties seized under ss. 50 and 51 were acquired from the
monies in the Maybank accounts or from any source.
[62] For the above reasons, the appellant submits that the trial
judge had erred in issuing the third party notice under s. 61(2)
since the requirements under s. 55(1) have not been satisfied.

E

F

G

H

Respondent’s Reply (Prosecution)
[63] The respondent submits that the subject matter of the
offence should not be confined to the properties specified in the
four charges but should include all those properties seized under
ss. 50 and 51 of the Act in respect of the money laundering

I

offence under s. 4(1) of the Act (P100-P112). The respondent
further submits that the prosecution has adduced sufficient
evidence on balance of probabilities that the monies in the
Maybank accounts specified in the four charges and all the
properties seized (exhs. P100-P112) were proceeds from the
unlawful activity that is, corrupt practice and the appellant failed
to satisfy the court that he was the true and lawful owner of the
said properties. The respondent therefore submits that the trial
judge had rightly issued the third party notice under s. 61(2) of
the Act.

C

Ruling Of The Court
What Constitutes The Subject Matter Of The Offence?
D

E

[64] First and foremost I must reiterate here that the procedure
of forfeiture of property upon prosecution for an offence under
s. 55(1) is civil in nature and the standard of proof required is
that of the balance of probabilities and not that of beyond
reasonable doubt. The burden is always on the prosecution to
prove that the properties which are liable to be forfeited are the
subject matters of the offence that is, under s. 4(1) of the Act.
[65] What is the subject matter of the offence in s. 55(1) should
be read with ss. 50 and 51 of the Act. For convenience, I shall
append below ss. 50(1) and 51(1):

F

G

H

[66] Section 50(1) reads:
Where the Public Prosecutor is satisfied on information given to
him by an investigating officer that any movable property,
including any monetary instrument or any accretion to it, which
is the subject-matter of an offence under subsection 4(1) or
evidence in relation to the commission of such offence, is in the
possession, custody or control of a financial institution, he may,
notwithstanding any law or rule of law, after consultation with
Bank Negara Malaysia, the Securities Commission or the Labuan
Offshore Financial Services Authority, as the case may be, by
order direct the financial institution not to part with, deal in, or
otherwise dispose of such property or any part of it until the
order is revoked or varied.

[67] Section 51(1) reads:
I

Where the Public Prosecutor is satisfied on information given to
him by an investigating officer that any immovable property is the
subject-matter of an offence under subsection 4(1) or evidence of
the commission of such offence, such property may be seized.



132

Current Law Journal

[2014] 6 CLJ

[68] It is clear from the above provisions that the Public
Prosecutor is satisfied that the properties seized under s. 50 and
s. 51 are the subject matters of the offence under s. 4(1) of the
Act. Similarly any properties specified in the four charges are also
alleged to be the subject matters of the money laundering offence
under s. 4(1) of the Act. I am of the considered view that in
interpreting the phrase ‘subject matter of the offence’ under s. 55(1)
of Act it should be interpreted broadly to include not only the
properties specified in the charges but also all those properties
seized under s. 50 and s. 51 of the Act. The broad interpretation
is to promote the underlying purpose or object of the Act. The
properties which are before the court consist of monies stated in
the four charges and the properties seized under ss. 50 and 51 of
the Act which were tendered in court as exhs. P100-P112. The
said properties are alleged to be the subject matters of the offence.
In order to forfeit the above mentioned properties under s. 55(1)
the Act, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities
that the said properties are in fact the subject matters of the
offence and the accused is not the true and lawful owner of the
properties and no other person is entitled for the property as a
purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration.
[69] The only issue before this court is to see if the evidence
adduced at the court below is sufficient to prove that those
properties stated in the charges as well as seized under s. 50 and
s. 51 are the subject matters of the offence under s. 4(1) of the
Act.

A

D

E

F

[70] I shall summarise the evidence adduced by the prosecution
at the court below as follows:
G

(i)

The appellant was involved in corrupt practices that is,
receiving bribes from SP20 and SP21 which is a predicated
offence;

(ii)

Evidence has been adduced through SP19, SP20 and
SP21 that a certain sum of corrupt monies had been paid
to the appellant over a period two years prior to the dates
stated in the charges;

H

A large sum of money amounting to RM3,957,080 was
found in the appellant’s Maybank accounts and his
movable and immovable properties in respect of the offence
under s. 4(1) were also seized;

was not involved in any form of business and he had no
other source of income;

The appellant failed to account for the monies paid in his
two Maybank accounts and the evidence which was led to
explain how he obtained the commission of RM6,250,000
from Shah was rejected by the trial judge; and

(vii)

SP24, told the court that his investigation revealed that
the appellant had an unknown source of income of about

commission from Shah.

[71] I agree that in the prosecution of a criminal offence under
s. 4(1) of the Act against the appellant the totality of the above
circumstantial evidence may not be sufficient to constitute prima
facie proof (beyond reasonable doubt standard) that the proceeds
were from an unlawful activity. Nevertheless in determining
whether a property is the subject matter of the offence in a
forfeiture proceeding which is civil in nature, I am satisfied that the
aforesaid circumstantial evidence in totality would constitute
sufficient proof on the balance of probabilities that the proceeds
found in the two bank accounts stated in the four charges as well
as all the other properties seized in respect of the money
laundering offence under ss. 50 and 51 of the Act are proceeds
of an unlawful activity which constitute the subject matters of the
offence and the appellant is not the true and lawful owner of such
properties.
[72] I find that the trial judge has rightly issued the notice to
