CRIMINAL PROCEDURE: Sentence - Adequacy of sentence - Whether

There were two appeals before this court. The appellants were appealing against
their convictions and sentences by the trial judge of the High Court. The 1st
appellant was the former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia (‘DPM’) who
was convicted for an offence punishable under s. 377B of the Penal Code
(‘PC’). He was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment to commence after he
had served his first sentence in respect of his conviction under the first trial.
The 2nd appellant was convicted for an offence punishable under s. 109 read
with s. 377B PC. He was also convicted for an offence punishable under
s. 377B PC. For his first conviction, the 2nd appellant was sentenced to six
years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the rattan whilst for the second
conviction, he was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and two strokes of
the rattan. The imprisonment terms were to run concurrently.
The issues, inter alia, were:

f

(i)

whether the trial judge should have disqualified himself from hearing the
case on the ground of conflict of interest and likelihood of bias;

(ii)

whether the amendments to the charges after the transfer of the case to
the High Court from the subordinate court pursuant to s. 418A Criminal
Procedure Code (‘CPC’) were a nullity since they should have been
reverted to the subordinate court;

(iii)

whether the appellants were deprived of their constitutional rights as they
could not rely on the defence of alibi for want of notice to be served as
required by s. 402A CPC since the trial judge had refused the 2nd
appellant’s application for an adjournment of the hearing to enable him
to serve a second notice of alibi in connection with the amended charges;

whether the trial judge failed to invoke s. 114(g) of the Evidence Act
1950 (‘EA’) against the prosecution since the charges were re-amended
and the prosecution failed to call certain persons as witnesses;

witness, Azizan, and his credibility as a witness was not impeached;

(vi)

a

b

whether Azizan was an accomplice and his testimony required
corroboration;

(vii) whether the confession of the 2nd appellant (‘the confession’) should not
have been taken into consideration by the trial judge against the 1st
appellant since it was subsequently retracted;

c

(viii) whether the trial judge erred in interpreting s. 30 EA in relation to the
use of the confession against the 1st appellant based on the Singapore
case of Chin Seow Noi & Ors v. Public Prosecutor.

Held:
Per Pajan Singh Gill JCA
[1]

[2]

The mere fact that at one time the trial judge had shares in the company
in which the Prime Minister’s son was also a shareholder was not
sufficient ground or circumstance to meet the bias test. Other than that,
there was nothing else shown by the 1st appellant that the relationship
of the shareholders in the company at the material time went beyond
business interest and that it was still continuing. Neither was it shown
that the Prime Minister’s son had any interest in the matter that was
before the trial judge. (p 434 g)
Under s. 418A CPC, it is the proceeding that is transferred when a
certificate is issued under that section and not the charge as contended
by the 1st appellant. Hence, there was no error by the trial judge when
he allowed the amendments to the charges. It has been consistently held
that it is for the public prosecutor to consider what charge to prefer
against an accused even upon an order of re-trial. Further, the
amendments were only related to the time and the period of the
commission of the alleged offences. There are authoritative decisions to
show that the time and date in a charge are immaterial. (pp 436 g &
437 d-g)

Section 402A CPC requirement for want of notice was enacted more for
the convenience of the prosecution. Since the 1st appellant did not serve
any notice of alibi nor did he request for time to serve one in respect of
the amended charge, there was no merit in his contention on this issue.
The 2nd appellant suffered no prejudice since the first notice of alibi
had been served and he was allowed to adduce evidence pursuant to that
notice. (pp 440 g-i & 441 a-e)

[4]

There was no merit in the appellants’ contention that the charges were
stale and vague. The trial judge found the charges to be clear and
unambiguous. There was no question of delay as the investigation began
in 1998 and the prosecution was initiated in 1999. Further, it was for
the appellants to show prejudicial effects. In any event, there should
hardly be any difficulty accounting the movements of the 1st appellant
since being a member of the cabinet and the DPM at the material time
his whereabouts would have been recorded. As for the 2nd appellant the
success or failure of his defence of alibi hinged on the alibi of the 1st
appellant. (pp 442 g-h, 443 a-h & 444 a-b)

[5]

There was no basis that the deputy public prosecutors acted in bad faith
when they preferred the charges against the appellants. The evidence relied
upon to indicate fabrication or extortion on their part did not support
such an assertion. (pp 444 g-h & 445 a-b)

[6]

The calling of witnesses in any prosecution is within the discretion of
the public prosecutor. As such, it was not appropriate to expect the trial
judge to invoke s. 114(g) EA on the prosecution’s failure to call certain
persons as witnesses. Further, there was no dispute that these persons
were offered to the defence at the end of the prosecution’s case. Hence,
there was no ground for the appellants to complain that they were not
available. (pp 445 h & 446 a-e)

[7]

The trial judge assessed the credibility of Azizan from various aspects,
inter alia, from the impeachment proceedings, the inconsistent statements
made by Azizan, corroborative evidence, the probability of Azizan being
an accomplice and his previous conviction for khalwat. Therefore, there
was nothing wrong in the conclusion of the trial judge for not impeaching
the credit of Azizan. Further, the trial judge accepted Azizan’s explanation
for the seemingly contradictory statements made by him. His acceptance
of the explanation should be given significant consideration as he had
the advantage of listening and seeing the demeanour of this witness in
the proceedings. (pp 452 g-h, 453 a-b & 456 d-e)

It would be wrong in law to reject the evidence of Azizan just because
he faltered in a few instances in the course of his testimony. Discrepancies
found in the testimony of a witness may be evidence of his truthfulness
rather than the reverse. Further, the apparent inconsistent statements of
Azizan during the first trial became the reason for the commencement
of the impeachment proceedings against him. With the conclusion arrived
at by the trial judge in respect of the said proceedings, any subsequent
reliance on those statements as positive evidence for the trial proper
should be disallowed. (p 459 b-d)
There were limits to the use of evidence adduced in a previous trial.
There was no assertion from the appellants that reliance was placed on
the previous statements of Azizan for their truth. They were only referred
to in an attempt to undermine the credibility of Azizan as a witness. Such
record of the previous inconsistent statement is only admissible if the
witness denies making that statement. The mere fact that the record
contains the inconsistencies does not make it admissible. (p 459 e-f)

a

b

d

[10] On corroboration, the legal principle as restated in TN Nathan v. Public
Prosecutor had no application in view of the trial judge’s finding of
Azizan being a truthful and reliable witness. (p 461 b)
[11] There was no reason to disagree with the trial judge that the act of the
1st appellant in asking Azizan to deny the contents of his statutory
declaration was corroborative of Azizan’s evidence and relevant by virtue
of s. 8 EA. There was no challenge from either of the appellants to the
prosecution’s assertion that the 1st appellant had asked Azizan to deny
the contents of the statutory declaration. Similarly, it was reasonable for
the trial judge to find corroborative evidence in the action of the 1st
appellant instructing one SAC1 Musa to cease investigations into the
matter. Further, the confession of the 2nd appellant as held by the trial
judge, was corroborative of Azizan’s evidence as it was made voluntarily
and was admitted in evidence. Although the confession was retracted, it
was still good corroboration for it is settled law that a confession even
if it is subsequently retracted can be a basis to convict a person so long
as the court is satisfied of its voluntariness and truth. (p 463 c-d & gh)

[12] There was no reason to disagree with the finding of the trial judge that
Azizan was not an accomplice. The trial judge did warn himself of the
danger of convicting an accused person in sexual cases on uncorroborated
evidence. Such a direction was sufficient. Further, the mere fact that
Azizan was convicted for the offence of khalwat was not a ground to
undermine his credibility as a witness as held by the trial judge. (p 465
c-g)
[13] Re-examination is confined to matters touched on during crossexamination. Fresh evidence adding to or re-affirming evidence-in-chief
is not permitted in re-examination. In the present case, Azizan was only
asked to explain his earlier answer that appeared to be contradictory.
Further, it could not be said that the appellants were totally shut out at
the material time. The appellants too could have asked for leave to further
cross-examine Azizan if they felt there was undue advantage taken during
the re-examination. (pp 466 h & 467 a-c)
[14] After a lapse of time, medical examination is not a reliable mean and
not the only method to determine whether or not a person has been
sodomised. As such, there was no merit in the 1st appellant’s contention
that there was no best corroborative evidence available because there was
no medical report of Azizan. Further, the failure to send Azizan for a
medical examination was not within the scope of s. 114(g) EA. There
was nothing to indicate that there was an intentional suppression of
evidence or an attempt to do so. (p 468 b-f)
[15] The trial judge had given his reasons for not attaching weight to the
evidence of one DSP Zull Aznam on the allegation that Azizan was
bribed to make the accusation against the 1st appellant. There was no
basis to differ from the finding of the trial judge as the credibility of a
witness is primarily a matter for the trial judge. Furthermore, Azizan
denied making such a disclosure. (pp 468 h & 469 a-c)

g

[16] There was no political conspiracy against the 1st appellant. The act of
Azizan in consulting a lawyer for advice at the material time and the
absence of any rebuttal from the 1st appellant demolished any theory of
fabrication on Azizan’s part. (p 469 f-g)

h

[17] Although the trial judge did not specifically consider why Azizan did not
make the police report earlier, he found Azizan to be a truthful witness
after having heard and seen him in the witness box and for other reasons.
Therefore, it could be assumed that the trial judge must have taken into

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

account this issue before coming to his conclusion. At any rate, failure
to lodge a police report is not fatal to the prosecution and it is not a
prerequisite for the commencement of an investigation by the police.
(p 470 d-e)
[18] As Azizan’s explanation for going back to work for the 1st appellant’s
wife despite being sodomised was not rebutted, it could be accepted as
credible explanation in the circumstances. (p 471 b)
[19] The press statements made by the Prime Minister and the then Inspector
General of Police were made in relation to the earlier police report lodged
against the 1st appellant and were therefore irrelevant. The result of an
investigation in an earlier police report does not necessarily negate any
probable positive result in an investigation based on a subsequent police
report. (p 472 c-g)
[20] There was no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s finding on the
admissibility of the confession by the 2nd appellant. There was no legal
necessity for him to expressly state that the standard of beyond reasonable
doubt had been met in order for the admission to be good in law. It
was implied from the finding. There was also no merit in the allegation
that the 2nd appellant was compelled to give his evidence. Save for his
bare denial on the truth of the material parts of the confession, the 2nd
appellant adduced no further evidence to support his assertion that the
contents of the confession were orchestrated by the police. Accordingly,
the trial judge was correct in his appreciation of the value and weight
to be attached to the confession and the resultant conclusion arising
therefrom in respect of proof against the 2nd appellant. (pp 476 e-h, 477
a & 479 f-h)
[21] The trial judge erred in interpreting s. 30 EA in relation to the use of
the confession against the 2nd appellant based on the Singapore case of
Chin Seow Noi & Ors v. Public Prosecutor. The trial judge had departed
from the obvious binding effect of the decisions of the highest court in
this country which enunciated the principle that a confession of one
accused may only be taken into consideration against the other to lend
assurance to the other evidence against them in believing the accused to
be guilty (Herchun Singh & Ors v. Public Prosecutor, Yap Chai Chai
& Anor v. Public Prosecutor). However, this misdirection did not nullify
the convictions of the appellants. The trial judge was prepared to act on
the evidence of Azizan without the confession to prove the guilt of the
1st appellant. Nevertheless, upon this court re-evaluating the confession,
it could be taken into consideration against the 1st appellant. (pp 482 c

[22] On the abetment charge against the 2nd appellant, it could be discerned
from the findings of the trial judge that the acts and omission of the
2nd appellant came under the third limb of s. 107 Penal Code. The mere
failure of the trial judge to clearly indicate the limb or limbs of the said
section did not prejudice the 2nd appellant in any way. More so when
the findings of the trial judge were findings of fact in which there were
limited reasons to interfere. (p 496 d-g)

c

[23] The trial judge had taken all the relevant factors into consideration in
the process of sentencing the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant’s previous
conviction that was taken into account by the trial judge was upheld by
the highest court of the country. As to the 2nd appellant, although the
trial judge did not take into account his previous conviction, the trial
judge did not err in any way in his process of sentencing the 2nd
appellant. (p 500 a-h)

Fakta semata yang bahawa pada satu masa hakim bicara mempunyai
saham dalam syarikat yang anak kepada Perdana Menteri juga merupakan
pemegang saham bukanlah satu alasan yang cukup atau keadaan yang
memenuhi ujian berat sebelah. Sebaliknya, perayu pertama tidak
menunjukkan langsung bahawa hubungan pemegang-pemegang saham di
dalam syarikat tersebut pada masa-masa matan, melebihi dari kepentingan
urusniaga dan ianya masih berterusan. Juga tidak ditunjukkan langsung
bahawa anak Perdana Menteri mempunyai sebarang kepentingan di dalam
perkara di hadapan hakim bicara.

Di bawah s. 418A KPJ, ianya adalah prosiding yang dipindahkan apabila
satu sijil dikeluarkan di bawah seksyen tersebut dan bukannya pertuduhan
sebagaimana yang dikatakan oleh perayu pertama. Dari itu, tidak terdapat
sebarang kesilapan oleh hakim bicara apabila beliau membenarkan
pindaan-pindaan pada pertuduhan. Ianya telah dengan konsistennya
diputuskan bahawa ianya adalah untuk pendakwa raya menimbangkan
pertuduhan apa yang wajar dibuat terhadap seseorang tertuduh malahan
pada masa satu perintah untuk bicara semula dibuat. Selanjutnya,
pindaan-pindaan tersebut hanya berhubung dengan masa dan tempoh
kesalahan yang didakwa dilakukan. Terdapat keputusan autoritatif yang
menunjukkan bahawa masa dan tarikh di dalam satu pertuduhan adalah
tidak material.

[3]

Keperluan untuk notis di bawah s. 402A KPJ digubalkan untuk lebih
memudahkan pendakwa. Oleh kerana perayu pertama tidak menyampaikan
sebarang notis dan tidak memohon masa untuk menyampaikan notis
berhubung dengan pertuduhan yang terpinda, tidak terdapat merit di dalam
pernyataan beliau berhubung dengan isu ini. Perayu kedua tidak
dimemudaratkan oleh kerana notis alibi telah pun diserahkan dan beliau
dibenarkan untuk mengemukakan keterangan berhubung dengan notis
tersebut.

[4]

Tidak terdapat sebarang merit di dalam dakwaan perayu-perayu bahawa
pertuduhan-pertuduhan tersebut tidak jelas dan lapuk. Hakim bicara
mendapati pertuduhan-pertudahan tersebut jelas dan terang. Tidak terdapat
persoalan berkenaan dengan kelewatan kerana penyiasatan bermula dalam
tahun 1998 dan pendakwaan telah diambil dalam tahun 1999. Selanjutnya,
ianya adalah untuk perayu untuk menunjukkan kesan-kesan yang
memudaratkan. Bagaimanapun, adalah tidak rumit untuk menjejaki
pergerakan perayu pertama oleh kerana beliau merupakan seorang ahli
kabinet dan TPM pada masa matan, dan pergerakan beliau pada masa
tersebut tentulah direkodkan. Mengenai perayu kedua pula, kejayaan atau
kegagalan pembelaan alibi bergantung kepada alibi perayu pertama.

Tidak terdapat sebarang asas bahawa timbalan pendakwa raya bertindak
dengan niat jahat apabila mereka membuat pertuduhan terhadap perayuperayu. Keterangan yang disandarkan untuk menunjukan rekaan palsu
atau pemerasan oleh mereka tidak menyokong tuduhan tersebut.

Pemanggilan saksi-saksi di dalam sesuatu pendakwaan adalah dalam
budibicara pendakwa raya. Oleh yang demikian, ianya adalah tidak wajar
untuk mengharap hakim bicara untuk menggunakan s. 114(g) AK apabila
pendakwa raya gagal untuk memanggil orang-orang tertentu sebagai saksi.
Selanjutnya, tidak terdapat sebarang pertikaian bahawa orang-orang ini
telah ditawarkan kepada pihak defendan pada akhir kes pendakwa. Dari
itu, tidak terdapat sebarang alasan untuk perayu-perayu merungut yang
mereka tidak ada.
Hakim bicara menilai kebolehpercayaan Azizan dari berbagai aspek,
antara lain, dari prosiding pencabaran, pernyataan-pernyataan yang tidak
konsisten yang dibuat oleh Azizan, keterangan-keterangan sokongan,
kebarangkalian yang Azizan merupakan rakan sejenayah dan sabitan
khalwat beliau yang terdahulu. Oleh yang demikian, tidak terdapat
sebarang silap pada keputusan hakim bicara untuk tidak mencabar
kebolehpercayaan Azizan. Selanjutnya, hakim bicara menerima penjelasan
Azizan untuk pernyataan-pernyataannya yang nampak bercanggah itu.
Penerimaan hakim bicara terhadap penjelasan tersebut wajar diberi
pertimbangan yang penting kerana beliau mempunyai kelebihan mendengar
dan melihat tingkahlaku saksi tersebut semasa prosiding.
Ianya salah disisi undang-undang untuk menolak keterangan Azizan hanya
kerana beliau beberapa kali teragak-agak dalam memberi testimoninya.
Perselisihan yang diketemui di dalam testimoni seorang saksi mungkin
keterangan mengenai kejujurannya dan bukan sebaliknya. Selanjutnya,
pernyataan-pernyataan yang nyatanya tidak konsisten oleh Azizan semasa
perbicaraan yang pertama menjadi sebab permulaan prosiding pencabaran
terhadapnya. Dengan kesimpulan yang dibuat oleh hakim bicara
berhubung dengan prosiding tersebut, sebarang sandaran kemudiannya
pada kenyataan-kenyataan tersebut sebagai keterangan positif untuk
perbicaraan sebenar patut tidak dibenarkan.
Terdapat batas pada kegunaan keterangan yang dikemukakan di dalam
perbicaraan yang terdahulu. Tidak terdapat sebarang tegasan dari perayuperayu bahawa sandaran dibuat pada pernyataan-pernyataan terdahulu
Azizan untuk kebenaran mereka. Mereka hanya dirujukkan sebagai satu
percubaan untuk melemahkan kebolehpercayaan Azizan sebagai saksi.
Rekod sedemikian berhubung dengan pernyataan terdahulu yang tidak
konsisten hanya diboleh diterima jika saksi menafikan membuat
pernyataan. Fakta semata yang rekod mengandungi percanggahan tidak
membuatkannya boleh diterima.

[10] Mengenai sokongan, prinsip undang-undang yang dinyatakan di dalam TN
Nathan v. Public Prosecutor tidak terpakai memandangkan pendapat

kandungan akuan berkanun beliau menyokong keterangan Azizan dan
relevan melalui s. 8 AK. Tidak terdapat sebarang cabaran dari manamana perayu kepada tuduhan pendakwa bahawa perayu pertama telah
meminta Azizan menafikan kandungan akuan berkanun. Sama juga, ianya
adalah wajar bagi hakim bicara untuk menemui keterangan sokongan
dalam tindakan perayu pertama memberi arahan kepada SAC1 Musa
untuk memberhentikan siasatan dalam perkara ini. Selanjutnya, pengakuan
perayu kedua sebagaimana yang diputuskan oleh hakim bicara,
menyokong keterangan Azizan kerana ianya dibuat secara sukarela dan
dibenarkan sebagai keterangan. Walaupun pengakuan telah ditarikbalik,
ianya masih satu sokongan yang baik kerana undang-undang menetapkan
bahawa pengakuan walaupun ianya kemudiannya ditarikbalik boleh
menjadi asas untuk mensabitkan seseorang selagi mahkamah berpuashati
yang ianya dibuat secara sukarela dan benar.
[12] Tidak terdapat sebarang sebab untuk tidak bersetuju dengan keputusan
hakim bicara bahawa Azizan bukan rakan sejenayah. Hakim bicara telah
menasihati dirinya mengenai bahaya mensabit seseorang tertuduh di dalam
kes seksual berdasarkan keterangan yang tidak disokong. Arahan
sedemikian sudah memadai. Selanjutnya, fakta semata yang Azizan telah
disabit dengan kesalahan khalwat tidak merupakan satu alasan untuk
melemahkan kebolehpercayaannya sebagai saksi sebagaimana yang
diputuskan oleh hakim bicara.
[13] Pemeriksaan semula hanya terhad kepada perkara-perkara yang disentuh
semasa pemeriksaan balas. Keterangan baru yang ditambah kepada atau
mengesahkan semula keterangan utama tidak dibenarkan dalam
pemeriksaan semula. Dalam kes semasa, Azizan hanya diminta untuk
menjelaskan jawapan beliau yang terdahulu yang nampak bercanggah.
Selanjutnya, ianya tidak dapat dikatakan bahawa perayu-perayu dihalang
secara mutlak pada masa matan. Perayu-perayu juga boleh memohon izin
untuk memeriksa balas Azizan jika mereka fikir terdapat kelebihan yang
tidak wajar diambil semasa periksa balas.

[14] Selepas keluputan masa, pemeriksaan perubatan tidak boleh dipercayai
dan bukan merupakan hanya satu kaedah untuk memutuskan sama ada
seseorang itu telah diliwat. Oleh yang demikian, tidak terdapat merit
dalam dakwaan perayu pertama bahawa tidak terdapat keterangan
sokongan yang terbaik kerana tidak ada laporan perubatan mengenai
Azizan. Selanjutnya, kegagalan untuk menghantar Azizan untuk
pemeriksaan perubatan tidak termasuk di bawah s. 114(g) AK. Tidak
terdapat apa-apa untuk menunjukkan bahawa terdapat niat untuk menyekat
keterangan ataupun sebarang percubaan untuk berbuat demikian.
[15] Hakim bicara telah memberikan sebab-sebab beliau tidak meletakkan berat
kepada keterangan DSP Zull Aznam pada tuduhan yang Azizan telah
dirasuah untuk membuat tuduhan tersebut terhadap perayu pertama. Tidak
terdapat sebarang asas untuk tidak mempersetujui keputusan hakim bicara
kerana kebolehpercayaan seseorang saksi adalah perkara yang terletak
terutamanya kepada hakim bicara. Tambahan pula, Azizan menafikan
membuat pendedahan sedemikian.
[16] Tidak terdapat sebarang konspirasi politik terhadap perayu pertama.
Tindakan Azizan meminta nasihat peguam pada masa matan dan
ketidakwujudan pematahan dari perayu pertama meruntuhkan sebarang
teori rekaan pada pihak Azizan.
[17] Walaupun hakim bicara tidak secara khusus mempertimbangkan mengapa
Azizan tidak membuat laporan polis terdahulunya, beliau mendapati
Azizan seorang saksi yang jujur setelah mendengar dan melihat beliau
di dalam kandang saksi dan juga atas alasan-alasan lain. Oleh yang
demikian, ianya boleh dianggap bahawa hakim bicara telah mengambilkira
isu ini sebelum mencapai keputusan beliau. Walaupun begitu, kegagalan
untuk membuat laporan polis tidak memudaratkan pendakwaan dan ianya
bukanlah sesuatu prasyarat untuk memulakan penyiasatan polis.
[18] Oleh kerana penjelasan Azizan balik bekerja semula dengan isteri perayu
pertama walaupun telah diliwat tidak dipatahkan, ianya dapat diterima
sebagai penjelasan yang boleh dipercayai dalam keadaan tersebut.
[19] Pernyataan akhbar yang dibuat oleh Perdana Menteri dan Ketua Polis
Negara pada masa itu dibuat berhubung dengan laporan polis terdahulu
terhadap perayu pertama dan dengan itu tidak relevan. Keputusan siasatan
pada laporan polis yang terdahulu tidak semestinya menafikan sebarang
keputusan positif dalam siasatan yang kemudiannya.

[20] Tidak terdapat sebarang sebab untuk campurtangan dengan pendapat
hakim bicara kerana membenarkan pengakuan perayu kedua. Tidak
terdapat sebarang keperluan undang-undang untuk beliau secara jelas
menyatakan bahawa tahap melebihi kesangsian yang wajar telah dicapai
untuk membenarkan kebolehterimaan pengakuan tersebut disisi undangundang. Ianya tersirat dalam pendapatnya. Juga, tiada merit dalam
dakwaan bahawa perayu kedua telah dipaksa untuk memberi keterangan.
Melainkan penafian semata beliau terhadap kebenaran bahagian material
pengakuan tersebut, perayu kedua tidak mengemukakan keterangan
tambahan untuk menyokong dakwaan beliau bahawa kandungan
pengakuan tersebut direka oleh polis. Dari itu, hakim bicara adalah betul
dalam penilaian beliau terhadap pengakuan tersebut dan kesimpulan
berikutannya berkaitan bukti terhadap perayu kedua.
[21] Hakim bicara tersilap dalam interpretasi s. 30 AK berhubung penggunaan
pengakuan tersebut terhadap perayu kedua berdasarkan kes Singapura
Chin Seow Noi & Ors v. Public Prosecutor. Hakim bicara tidak
mengikuti keputusan mahkamah yang tertinggi di negara ini yang
menetapkan prinsip bahawa pengakuan seorang tertuduh boleh diambilkira
terhadap seseorang tertuduh yang lain untuk memberi jaminan kepada
lain-lain keterangan terhadap mereka dalam mempercayai mereka bersalah
(Herchun Singh & Ors lwn. Public Prosecutor, Yap Chai Chai & Anor
v. Public Prosecutor). Walau bagaimanapun, salah arahan ini tidak
membatalkan sabitan-sabitan perayu-perayu. Hakim bicara telah bersedia
untuk bertindak di atas keterangan Azizan tanpa pengakuan tersebut untuk
membuktikan kesalahan perayu pertama. Namun demikian, selepas
mahkamah ini menilai semula pengakuan tersebut, ianya boleh
dipertimbangkan terhadap perayu pertama.
[22] Mengenai pertuduhan persubahatan terhadap perayu kedua, ianya dapat
dilihat dari keputusan hakim bicara bahawa perbuatan-perbuatan dan
peninggalan-peninggalan perayu kedua termasuk di bawah bahagian ketiga
s. 107 Kanun Keseksaan. Kegagalan semata hakim bicara untuk
menunjukan secara jelas bahagian mana seksyen tersebut terpakai tidak
memudaratkan perayu kedua dalam apa cara pun. Lebih-lebih lagi apabila
pendapat hakim bicara adalah pendapat fakta dalam mana mahkamah ini
sebagai mahkamah rayuan mempunyai batasnya untuk bercampurtangan.

[23] Hakim bicara telah mengambil semua faktor yang relevan dalam membuat
pertimbangan untuk menjatuhkan hukuman terhadap perayu pertama.
Sabitan terdahulu perayu pertama yang diambil kira oleh hakim bicara
telah disahkan oleh mahkamah yang tertinggi di negara ini. Mengenai
perayu kedua pula, walaupun hakim bicara tidak mengambil kira sabitan
beliau yang terdahulu, hakim bicara tidak silap dalam apa cara pun dalam
proses beliau menghukum perayu kedua.

The ingredients of the offences alleged in the charges preferred against the
appellants have been correctly dealt with by the learned trial judge in his
grounds of judgment. There was no dispute on that point.

g

Thus, having heard the appeals as a whole we noted that the thrust of the
complaint of both the appellants was on the learned trial judge’s assessment
of witnesses called, reception, appreciation and application of the evidence
adduced by both the prosecution and the defence vis-à-vis the charges preferred
against them.
For convenience we reproduce herewith the relevant sections under consideration.

h

In respect of the sole charge preferred against the first appellant and the second
charge preferred against the second appellant the relevant sections in the Penal
Code read:

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

429

377A. Carnal intercourse against the order of nature

a

Any person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction
of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit
carnal intercourse against the order of nature.
Explanation – Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual connection
necessary to the offence described in this section.

b

377B. Punishment for the committing carnal intercourse against the order
of nature
Whoever voluntarily commits carnal intercourse against the order of nature
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to twenty
years, and shall also be liable to whipping.

c

As for the first charge preferred against the second appellant the relevant
sections in the Penal Code read:
107. Abetment of a thing
A person abets the doing of a thing who:

d

(a) instigates any person to do that thing;
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for
the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in
pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing;
or

e

(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1 – A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful
concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily
causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is
said to instigate the doing of that thing.

f

109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in
consequence, and where no express provision is made for its punishment
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in
consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code
for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment
provided for the offence.

Brief Background Summary
It is the version of the Prosecution that one night between the months of January
1993 and March 1993 Azizan came to the apartment of the second appellant
at Unit No. 10-7-2, Tivoli Villa, Jalan Medang Tanduk, Bangsar, in the Federal
Territory of Kuala Lumpur on the latter’s invitation. On arrival Azizan was
surprised to find the first appellant there. Anyway he was signalled by way of
a hand gesture to go into a room where he was sodomized by the first appellant
in the presence of the second appellant. Thereafter the second appellant
proceeded to sodomize him as well.
After the incident there was no immediate complaint lodged by Azizan with
the police or other relevant authorities. However by way of a statutory
declaration made on 5 August 1997 (‘P5’) drafted by one Umi Halfida at his
request, the said Azizan narrated the fact that he had been sodomized by the
first appellant in 1992. Copies of the same were given to certain personalities
including the Prime Minister and a lawyer Mr. Karpal Singh. Initially there
was a flurry of Police investigation carried out to record statements including
that of Azizan. Nevertheless, for a while the issue appeared to subside.
However, it resurfaced following the Police report lodged by one Mohd Azmin
bin Ali vide Dang Wangi Police Report No 144140/ 98. Azizan was then asked
to give his statement to the Police. He had given statements to the Police earlier
on in connection with another Police report also related to allegation of sexual
misconduct of the first appellant.
The revival of the investigation resulted in a charge being preferred against
the first appellant accusing him of having sodomized Azizan. But the month
and year stated in the initial charge was May 1994 when the matter was first
brought before the Sessions Court Kuala Lumpur on 29 September 1998.
Subsequently vide a certificate issued by the public prosecutor in the exercise
of his power under s. 418A(1) of the CPC the matter was transferred to the
Kuala Lumpur High Court. And during the mention of the case on 27 April
1999 the prosecution applied to amend the charge in respect of the year only
from 1994 to 1992. Typographical error was given as the reason.
Meanwhile on 23 April 1999 the second appellant was charged for two offences,
firstly for abetting the first appellant in May 1992 in the commission of the
alleged offence for which the first appellant was charged and secondly for
sodomizing Azizan during the same period. The matter first came before the
Sessions Court Kuala Lumpur. Later on it was transferred to the Kuala Lumpur
High Court pursuant to a certificate issued by the public prosecutor under
s. 413A(1) of the CPC. The second appellant then served a notice of alibi dated
27 May 1999 on the public prosecutor in connection with the charges preferred
against him wherein the alleged date of incident was ‘May 1992’.

A joint trial for both the matters commenced before the Kuala Lumpur High
Court on 7 June 1999. At the commencement of the joint trial the prosecution
applied to amend the respective May 1992 charges of the appellants to the
dates ‘between the months of January to March 1993’.
It is to be noted that after the first mention of the case against the first
appellant on 10 October 1998 there were further mentions on 14 April 1999,
27 April 1999 and 4 May 1999. Pending the commencement of the trial proper
Azizan was also called by the Investigation officer Senior Assistant
Commissioner-1 (‘SAC1’) Musa bin Hassan to give his further statement.
Objections were made against the amendments to the respective charges but
were overruled by the learned trial judge. In fact there was an application made
by the defence to have the charges struck out. That was also dismissed and
an appeal against that decision is pending in the Court of Appeal. The
objections and application took time for consideration by the learned trial judge,
hence the first witness was called only when hearing resumed on 16 June 1999.

It was also drawn to our attention during the hearing of these appeals that at
the commencement of the hearing on 7 June 1999 in the court below the lead
counsel for the first appellant was YM Raja Aziz Addruse. Mr. Karpal Singh
was appearing for the second appellant.

The Trial Before The High Court
The trial before the learned judge in the court below took several weeks
interspersed with adjournments. At the conclusion of the hearing and after
deliberating on the evidence adduced the learned trial judge came to several
findings on facts and law to the issues raised, and ultimately held that the
prosecution had proved its case against both the appellants beyond reasonable
doubt and that the defence failed to raise any reasonable doubt on the
prosecution’s case.
Some of the pertinent findings of the learned trial judge are as follows, inter
alia:

f

g

(i) on the technical points:
(a) that there was no merit in the application to strike out the charges
preferred against the appellants;
(b) that the reason advanced to disqualify him from hearing the case was
frivolous and irrelevant; and
(c) that the notice of alibi given by the second appellant before the
amendment to the May 1992 charges preferred against him remained
valid and that there was no necessity for the second appellant to file a

fresh notice under s. 402A of the CPC. It is to be noted that contrary
to what the learned trial judge had said but as contended by the learned
public prosecutor before us which we agree, the first appellant never
served a notice of alibi pursuant to s. 402A of the CPC in connection
with the charge preferred against him.
(ii) on the merits:
(a) that the prosecution had proved its case against both the appellants on
the following evidence adduced:

c

d

(i) the evidence of the principal witness, Azizan. The learned trial judge
found this witness credible and that his testimony believable and
remained un-impeached. In assessing the credibility of Azizan the
learned trial judge considered the several applications and
submissions by the defence advanced to negate the evidence of
Azizan. Such applications included the impeachment proceeding and
for his recall after his conviction for khalwat; and
(ii) the admission of the confession of the second appellant as against
him and his co-accused.

e

(b) that the defence failed to prove its defences of alibi, fabrication and
conspiracy.

f

The Appeals
Before us the several grounds in the petitions of appeal were categorized and
given different emphasis in submissions. But ultimately we note that the main
focal points in the appeals are the acceptance by the learned trial judge of
Azizan as being a credible witness despite of the contradictory statements he
made in the present case as well as in the first trial and the amendment of the
May 1992 charges against the respective appellants. Having heard all the
submissions we are of the view that the grounds can be summarized in two
broad categories, namely, on technical issues and on merits.

g

The technical issues raised are as follows:
(i) that the trial was not according to law and thus infringed art. 5 of the
Federal Constitution in that:

h

(a) the learned trial judge should have disqualified himself from hearing
the case on the ground of conflict of interest and likelihood of bias;
and
(b) the learned trial judge disregarded the basic elements of the law on
procedure and evidence in particular as regards the standard of proof
at the close of the prosecution’s case.

i

ii. that the amendments to the May 1992 charges after the transfer to High

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

433

Court pursuant to s. 418A of the CPC was a nullity since the same should
have been reverted to the lower court from where they originated before
the amendment were made;

a

iii. that with the amendments to the charges the trial was a nullity since no
opportunity was given for notice of alibi to be served as required by law;
iv. that the admission of alibi evidence without notice being given was a
serious error in law as the learned trial judge had no discretion to admit
such evidence;
v. that the charges preferred against the appellants were vague and stale and
the public prosecutor and his deputies acted in bad faith when preferring
the charges against the appellants;

b

c

vi. that there was a failure by the learned trial judge to appreciate the burden
and standard of proof required of the prosecution and the defence
respectively in order to succeed in their stands; and
vii. that there was a failure by the learned trial judge to invoke s. 114(g) of
EA 1950 when it was appropriate to do so.

d

On merits the primary heads of complaints are:
(a) on the approach and analysis by the learned trial judge on the testimony
of Azizan in respect of:

e

i. his credibility as a witness;
ii. the impeachment proceeding;
iii. the law on corroboration vis-à-vis the evidence of Azizan; and

f

iv. the law of accomplice and the confession of the second appellant.
(b) on the admission and truth of the confession of the second appellant and
the reliance on the confession against the first appellant;
(c) the failure of the learned trial judge to properly consider and evaluate the
evidence adduced to substantiate the defences of fabrication and conspiracy
raised by the first appellant;

g

(d) the appreciation of the evidence on the alibi adduced by the appellants;
and
(e) the lack of evidence against the second appellant in respect of the charge
of abetment.

h

The grievances on the sentences imposed will be dealt with later.

The technical issues – contentions and findings
(i) Was the trial according to law?
(a) Disqualification of the trial judge

b

c

d

e

Learned counsel for the first appellant contended that the learned trial judge
should have disqualified himself from hearing the case in view of his past
ownership of shares in Dataprep, a company in which one of the sons of the
Prime Minister was also a shareholder. And this was added by the fact that
the learned trial judge failed to disclose such fact voluntarily. According to
learned counsel there was a failure to meet the bias test as understood in law.
In response the learned public prosecutor argued that in his application to
disqualify the learned trial judge the first appellant failed to show that there
was a real danger of bias on the part of the learned trial judge in proceeding
to hear the case. The cases of R v. Gough [1993] 2 All ER 724 and Mohamed
Ezam bin Mohd. Nor & Ors. v. Ketua Polis Negara [2001] 4 CLJ 701 FC
were cited.
In his grounds of judgment the learned trial judge ruled that the application
was without logic since neither the Prime Minister’s son nor the company was
a party to the matter before him. And he went on to say this:
The principle in Pinochet’s case does not apply.

f

g

h

The real danger and reasonable apprehension and suspicion that I may be
biased as alleged although it is not alleged, I am biased is a mere allegation
by the counsel without any basis. It is raised for the purpose to embarrass
me and for no apparent reasons and to delay this proceedings (sic).

We have considered this issue and we are of the view that there is no merit
in it. We agree with the learned trial judge that such an issue should not arise
in the first place since the matter before him did not involve the entity or
personality that he had once associated with. Hence the mere fact that at one
time he had shares in the company in which the son of the Prime Minister
was also a shareholder could not be held to be a sufficient ground or
circumstance to meet the test, namely, whether ‘there was a real danger of bias
on the part of the learned trial judge’. (See: Mohamed Ezam bin Mohd. Nor
& Ors. v. Public Prosecutor (supra); R v. Gough (supra)). We would go
further and say that the allegation and the factual circumstance simply could
not have ‘caused a fair-minded and informed bystander to entertain a fear of
real danger of bias’. (See: Alor Janggus Soon Seng Trading Sdn Bhd & Ors
v. Sey Hoe Sdn Bhd & Ors [2002] 4 CLJ 268; Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield
Properties Ltd & Anor. [2000] 1 All ER 65).

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

435

Indeed other than the fact that the learned trial judge was a shareholder in the
said company there was nothing else shown by the first appellant that indeed
the relationship of the shareholders in the company at the material time went
beyond business interest. And that it is still continuing. It was also not shown
that the Prime Minister’s son had any interest in the matter that was before
the learned trial judge as to allow a fair-minded and informed bystander to
entertain a fear of a real danger of bias on the part of the learned trial judge.
In our view it is not for any reason or assertion that a judge should be
disqualified from hearing a case. Indeed a judge was even allowed to try a
case involving a person he had contacts with previously. (See: R.C Pollard v.
Satya Gopal Mazumdar AIR [1943] Cal 594). And this court had also
expressed its abhorrence to the unhealthy trend of parties to disqualify judges
for minor reasons. In Hock Hua Bank (Sabah) Bhd v. Yong Liuk Thin & Ors
[1995] 2 CLJ 900 this is what the court said:

a

b

c

I notice an unhealthy trend of late to allege bias too readily against a judicial
arbiter on insufficient material. Nothing is capable of eroding public confidence
in the judicial arm of the state than unwarranted and unfounded allegations
of bias. It is therefore to be avoided at all costs, if necessary, by having resort
to the power to punish for contempt. per Gopal Sri Ram JCA at p. 220.

d

(b) Observance of elements of procedure and evidence
Next, the assertion on the failure by the learned trial judge to observe the basic
elements of procedure and evidence when conducting the trial. We find this
complaint devoid of any merit. It is too general and could only be dealt with
specifically on the various grounds advanced by the appellants. We propose to
do just that. At any rate we find no fault in respect of the standard of proof
adopted by the learned trial judge at the end of the prosecution’s case. He said
this:

e

… the standard of proof required of the prosecution at the end of its case in
the instant case before me is proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the charges
against both accused as the alleged offences committed by the accused were
between the month of January to March 1993.

(c) Section 418A and the amendments to the charges
Briefly put, it was the contention of learned counsel for the first appellant that
pursuant to the certificate issued under s. 418A CPC it was the charges
containing the allegations of wrongdoing in 1994 and/or May 1992 that were
transferred to the High Court from the subordinate court. As such the High
Court should have declined the application to amend those charges. Otherwise
it would be an infringement of s. 418A resulting in the subsequent trial illegal.
Any amendment should entail the reverting of the matter to the subordinate
court.

In reply the learned public prosecutor submitted that pursuant to the certificate
issued under s. 418A, what was transmitted to the High Court was the
proceeding and not the charges.
This issue was not directly addressed in the grounds of judgment of the learned
trial judge. But in the earlier miscellaneous applications by the appellants to
have the proceeding struck out due to the amendments to the charges preferred,
the learned trial judge dismissed them on the ground that they were devoid of
any merits. There is a pending appeal on that dismissal. Be that as it may the
issue lies before us for consideration.
Section 418A reads:
Trials by High Court on a certificate by the Public Prosecutor

d

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 417 and subject to section 418b,
the Public Prosecutor may in any particular case triable by a criminal
Court subordinate to the High Court issue a certificate specifying the
High Court in which the proceedings are to be instituted or
transferred and requiring that the accused person be caused to appear
or be produced before such High Court.
(2) The power of the Public Prosecutor under subsection (1) shall be
exercised by him personally.

e

(3) The certificate of the Public Prosecutor issued under subsection (1) shall
be tendered to the Subordinate Court before which the case is triable
whereupon the Court shall transfer the case to the High Court specified
in the certificate and cause the accused person to appear or be brought
before such Court as soon as may be practicable.

f

(4) When the accused person appears or is brought before the High Court
in accordance with subsection (3), the High Court shall fix a date for
his trial which shall be held in accordance with the procedure under
Chapter XX. (emphasis added).

g

h

From our reading of the section it is patently clear that it is the proceeding
that is being transmitted when a certificate is issued and not the charge. That
can be implied in the judgment of his Lordship Ahmad Fairuz FCJ (as he then
was) in the case of Abdul Ghani bin Ali & Ors v. Public Prosecutor [2001]
3 CLJ 769 where at p. 811 his Lordship said this:
In s. 418A of the CPC, a public prosecutor’s certificate would effect a transfer
of a case pending in a subordinate court to a High Court and thereafter the
trial in the case shall be held in accordance with the procedure under Chapter
XX of the CPC. (emphasis added).

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

437

To agree therefore with the contention of learned counsel for the first appellant
would mean to curtail the powers of the High Court in the further conduct of
the trial, for instance, the power under s. 158 of CPC which reads:

a

Court may alter or add to charge
(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment
is pronounced.

b

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the
accused. (emphasis added).

There is also nothing to indicate in the foregoing section that it is subject to
s. 418A.
In respect of the application by the prosecution to amend the charges preferred
against the appellants the learned trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion,
allowed it. He also ruled that there was no necessity for the prosecution to
explain the reason for such amendments. However in this case explanation was
given when the application was made.
Hence, we find no error in the conclusion of the learned trial judge in allowing
the amendments to the charges. It has been consistently held that it is for the
public prosecutor to consider what charge to prefer against an accused person
even upon an order of retrial. That question was posed and answered in the
affirmative in the case of Lee Weng Sang v. Public Prosecutor [1977] 1 MLJ
166. His Lordship Hashim Yeop Sani J (as he then was) said this at p. 167:
To sum up, an order of retrial would result in the trial to commence de novo
and it is my opinion that even if the appellate judge had thought it fit to
frame the charge or charges appropriate in his view for retrial that would
not deprive the Public Prosecutor from exercising his own power under the
Criminal Procedure Code to amend, alter, reduce or enhance the charges or
even to offer no evidence in the proceedings.

In any event the amendments were only related to the time and period of the
commission of the alleged offences by the respective appellants. And there are
authoritative decisions of our courts wherein time and date in a charge were
held to be immaterial. In Hussin bin Sillit v. Public Prosecutor [1988] 2 MLJ
232 his Lordship Mohd. Azmi SCJ at p. 236 said this:
It should be borne in mind that where the charge relates to only one offence,
merely amending the date, place or time in the charge would not necessarily
constitute amending the offence, and under section 156 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, “no error in stating either the offence or the particulars
required to be stated in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or
those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless
the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission.” Thus, under

illustration (d) of section 156, it is illustrated, “‘A’ is charged with the murder
of John Smith on 6 June 1910. In fact the murdered person’s name was James
Smith and the date of the murder was 5 June 1910. ‘A’ was never charged
with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the magistrate
which referred exclusively to the case of James Smith. The court may infer
from these facts that ‘A’ was not misled, and that the error in the charge
was immaterial.” Clearly, each situation must depend on the facts and
circumstances of the particular case in determining whether any amendment
as to time, date or place affected before or in the course of the trial entails
changing the offence with which the accused is charged into an entirely
different offence. There is no reason to suppose that every amendment, either
before or after commencement of the trial, must necessarily change the
occasion in the original charge into an entirely different occasion so as to
exclude evidence pertaining to it from being “evidence in support of a defence
of alibi”.

And in Law Kiat Lang v. Public Prosecutor [1966] 1 MLJ 215 his Lordship
Thomson LP at p. 216 made reference to an English case and said this:
With regard to the first of these charges, the dates are wrong and the charge
was at no time amended. This in itself, however, is without importance. As
was observed by Atkin J in the case of Severo Dossi [1918] 13 Cr. App. R
158, 159:

e

From time immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been
a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the alleged
offence.

Accordingly, we find no merit in the contention of learned counsel for the
Appellants to the above mentioned issue.
f

g

h

i

(d) Amendment of the charges and the defence of alibi
Firstly, Mr. Karpal Singh who, in these appeals appeared for the first appellant,
submitted before us that upon amendments to the charges being allowed an
application was made by the second appellant for an adjournment of the hearing
for a period of 12 days to enable the service of notice of alibi in connection
with the amended charges but was refused when hearing resumed on 16 June
1999. It was therefore submitted before us that there was deprivation to the
appellants of their constitutional rights in that they could not rely on the defence
of alibi for want of notice to be served as required by s. 402A of CPC. Learned
counsel therefore went on to say that as a result the trial was a nullity.
Secondly, it was contended that notwithstanding the stand taken by the public
prosecutor in not demanding for notice of alibi to be served and for not
objecting to the admission of evidence pertaining to the defence of alibi, that
should not detract from the fact that there was a serious breach of a mandatory
statutory provision which entailed the trial a nullity. According to learned

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

439

counsel the statutory provision could not be construed to endow the court or
the prosecution with discretion on admission of alibi evidence without due
compliance with the prerequisite of notice to be served.
The learned public prosecutor in his response to the above arguments submitted
that in respect of the first appellant the issue did not arise simply because he
did not serve or file any notice of alibi. And neither was there an application
by him or his then learned counsel for an adjournment of the hearing for the
purpose of serving a notice of alibi on the amended charge. Thus it was the
contention of the learned public prosecutor that he would concede that the
learned trial judge misdirected himself in allowing the admission of the alibi
evidence tendered by the first appellant when no notice was served in compliance
with s. 402A of the CPC.

a

b

c

Incidentally, it was also in the submission of the learned public prosecutor that
although it was the stand of the defence that a notice of alibi was served by
the first appellant in respect of the May 1992 charge, the prosecution never
received it. Notwithstanding the denial of receipt the issue was also left for
the court to decide. With respect we have already expressed our view on this
point hereinabove and we need not reiterate it.

d

Now, in particular reference to the contention advanced for the second appellant
the learned trial judge ruled, inter alia:

e

(i) that he was of the view that the notice of alibi served earlier on the public
prosecutor in relation to the May 1992 charge was still valid and remained
effective despite the amendment to the charges at the commencement of
the trial. And that it was not necessary for the second appellant to serve
a fresh notice as in the circumstances the requirements of s. 402A(1) of
the CPC had been duly complied with and that the second appellant was
entitled to adduce evidence in support of his alibi;
(ii) that in the circumstances of the case he failed to see how the defence could
be said to have been put in a disadvantage position with the amendment
to the dates in the charges since the appellants were allowed to adduce
evidence in support of their alibi;

f

g

(iii) that the purpose of giving notice of alibi is to ‘divert the mischief of the
defence disclosing his defence of alibi at a late stage of the trial’;
(iv) that once ‘the defence of alibi is properly raised by the defence the
prosecution has the discretion to investigate into the alibi if they feel like
doing so. However, investigation into the alibi would be entirely the
discretion of the Police under the direction of the public prosecutor;
(v) that whether to investigate or not, would be entirely for the public

CLJ

h

i



440

Current Law Journal

[2003] 4 CLJ

a

prosecutor to decide and within his prerogative. No one could force the
public prosecutor to investigate as he should know what evidence he
possessed to challenge the defence of alibi. And it would be ‘the
prosecution’s own funeral if as a result of non investigation the evidence
adduced by the defence in support of the alibi is not challenged’.

b

(vi) that the court would decide on the success or failure of the defence of
alibi based on the evidence before it.
In order to appreciate the true intention of and the mischief addressed by
s. 402A of CPC it is appropriate to reproduce it here. And it reads:

c

d

e

(1) Where in any criminal trial the accused seeks to put forward a defence
of alibi, evidence in support of it shall not be admitted unless the
accused shall have given notice in writing of it to the Public Prosecutor
at least ten days before the commencement of the trial.
(2) The notice required by subsection (1) shall include particulars of
place where the accused claims to have been at the time of
commission of the offence with which he is charged, together with
names and addresses of any witnesses whom he intends to call for
purpose of establishing his alibi. (emphasis added).

the
the
the
the

On plain reading of the section it can be discerned that its only purpose is to
prevent surprise to the prosecution in a criminal trial. That view was expressed
by his Lordship Salleh Abas FJ (as he then was) in the case of Krishnan &
Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1981] 2 MLJ 121 when he said this at p. 122:
The object of the notice is merely to enable the prosecution to check upon
the veracity of the alibi.

f

g

h

And the beneficial aspects of that measure are to prevent unnecessary
prosecution of a person who could clearly show that he was not at the scene
of the crime, to allow the prosecution to prepare its rebuttal evidence on the
alibi evidence and perhaps costs saving as adjournment would be avoided. If
it is not made mandatory for an accused person to comply with the requirement
then the primary purpose of that section would be defeated. In short, the section
was enacted more for the convenience of the prosecution. To that extent we
are in agreement with the above reasoning of the learned trial judge.
In respect of the first appellant, as noted earlier on, he did not serve any notice
of alibi. Neither did he indicate that he would definitely want to serve a notice
of alibi on the public prosecutor in connection with the amended charge
preferred against him. As submitted by the learned public prosecutor the then
lead counsel of the first appellant only contended that a specific date should
be given in the charge otherwise the first appellant might not be able to serve

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

441

a notice of alibi. With respect, that is not the same as requesting for time to
enable the service of a notice of alibi on the amended charge. Indeed no
adjournment was asked for. And that could be explained by the fact that at
that time the main objection was that the charge should not have been amended
at all. Accordingly in respect of the first appellant and as contended by the
learned public prosecutor we are inclined to think that since no notice of alibi
was ever served and no request for time to serve one in respect of the amended
charge there is therefore no merit in the contention advanced on his behalf on
the issue. In respect of the reception of the evidence adduced by the first
appellant despite the absence of the required notice and whether that should
result in annulling the trial, we will deal with it later on in this judgment.
On the other hand the second appellant did ask for an adjournment. But it
was the contention of the learned public prosecutor that his inability to serve
a second notice of alibi did not prejudice him in anyway and at any rate his
defence was not one of alibi. The case of Vasan Singh v. Public Prosecutor
[1989] 2 CLJ 402; [1989] 1 CLJ (Rep) 166 was cited.
Now, in addition to what we have said earlier on, we are inclined to agree
that the second appellant suffered no prejudice since there was already the first
notice of alibi served. Further, the second appellant was allowed to adduce
evidence of his alibi pursuant to the first notice. Of course whether or not such
evidence was indeed evidence of alibi will be dealt with later on in this
judgment.
As regards the cases cited to us such as Wong Kim Leng v. Public Prosecutor
[1997] 2 MLJ 97, Public Prosecutor v. Lim Chen Len [1981] 2 MLJ 41 and
Rangapula & Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1981] CLJ 129; [1981] CLJ (Rep)
261 we have no doubt that they accurately stated the law on the prerequisites
to adducing evidence of alibi. However on the facts of the present case these
authorities are distinguishable. In respect of the second appellant they are also
not directly relevant in that there is no dispute that the second appellant served
a notice of alibi albeit for the May 1992 charge.
Accordingly we do not think the approach taken by the learned trial Judge on
this issue of alibi and the notice thereof was entirely wrong particularly in
respect of the second appellant as to warrant a ruling that the whole trial was
a nullity. Perhaps we should remind ourselves of what his Lordship H.T. Ong
CJ (Malaya) had to say on excessive legalism in the case of Yap Chai Chai
& Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1973] 1 MLJ 219 at p. 221:

[2003] 4 CLJ

What is always of paramount importance in the administration of criminal
justice is a fair trial – not such excessive legalism as to give the ordinary
meaning of words the sacrosanctity of a ritual.

On the issue of the amendment to the charges in respect of the date alleged in
the commission of the offences subsequent to the notice of alibi we need only
to adopt the view expressed by the majority in the Supreme Court of Canada
in the case of Regina v. P (M.B) 89 C.C.C. (3d) 289; [1994] C.C.C. LEXIS
2454; 113 D.L.R. (4th) 461, where Lamer CJ opined thus (at p. 297):
The fact that an accused may have an alibi for the period (or part of the
period) described in the indictment does not automatically “freeze” the dates
specified in the indictment. That is to say, there is no vested right to a given
alibi. Alibi evidence must respond to the case as presented by the Crown and
not the other way around. (emphasis added).

Accordingly, we hold that the mere giving of the notice of alibi by the second
appellant should not be construed as having the effect of limiting or ‘freezing’
the date or time specified in the charges preferred against them. As such in
our view the hype on the three times changes to the dates in the charges was
a result of a misapprehension of the true position of the law in respect of time
factor when a charge is preferred against a person. Thus, in the instant case
we find no compelling ground to accept the contention of learned counsel for
the first appellant on the forgoing issue.
Stale And Vague Charges
Next is on the contention that the charges preferred against the appellants were
stale, vague and done with bad faith.

f

g

h

In respect of the first assertion it was premised on the time lapse between the
alleged commission of the offences and the arraignment of the accused. It was
also contended that the charges were vague in term of time and other
particulars.
Now, on this issue of charge being vague we are not convinced that there is
any merit in it. The learned trial judge came to his finding on the issue in
this way:
In this instant case it is clear that in the charges it is specified the offences
were alleged to have been committed one night at about 7.45pm between the
months of January and March 1993 at Tivoli Villa, in the Federal Territory
of Kuala Lumpur, I am of the view that these are particulars sufficient to
clothe the charges with clarity and certainty. The charges as amended are clear
and unambiguous and as such both the accused have not in any way misled
by the charges as framed. Both the accused know what the charges are against
them. They are not in any way prejudiced by the failure of the prosecution

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

443

to state the exact date and this omission has not occasioned a miscarriage of
justice. In any event a date in the charge has never been material. In R v.
Severo Dossi [1918] 13 Cr App R 158 (quoted in Law Kiat Lang v. PP [1966]
1 MLJ 215 and Ho Ming Siang v. PP [1966] 1 MLJ 252) Lord Atkin J
observed:

a

From time in memorial a date specified in an indictment has never been
a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the alleged
offence.

b

With due respect we find nothing gravely erroneous in the finding as to warrant
an interference by this court.
As regards the allegation of stale charges it was also the submission of the
learned public prosecutor that the allegation of stale charge should not arise
since the investigation of the case only commenced in 1998 with the publication
of the ‘Buku 50 Dalil’ and the prosecution was launched in 1999. And it was
also contended that in criminal law there is no time limitation.

c

d

Having considered the facts and circumstances as adduced in evidence we are
inclined to agree with the learned public prosecutor. We would add that the
assertions of stale charge and delay in the prosecution are of similar nature
and hence our view on the effect of the alleged delay is therefore equally
applicable.

e

For the sake of completeness we should briefly note the submissions of learned
counsel on the issue of delay. It was submitted for the appellants that the time
lapse between the alleged commission of the offences and the prosecution was
too long. The delay according to learned counsel had prejudicial effect to the
defence particularly in recalling events for the defence of alibi.

f

In answer to that argument learned public prosecutor submitted that it was for
the defence to show that there was such delay that it amounted to an abuse of
process and had caused undue prejudice and unfairness to the appellants.
To begin, we would think that there should be no question of delay going by
what the learned public prosecutor had submitted. The investigation began in
1998 and the prosecution was initiated in 1999. Further, we are inclined to
agree that on such allegation it would be for the appellants to show prejudicial
effect or effects. Indeed it has been said that delay in the prosecution of a
person for an offence such as sexual offence should not necessarily be deemed
to be prejudicial to an accused. ‘It is a matter for the trial judge having heard
the evidence to determine whether the memory of the complainants or of the
respondent has dimmed with the passage of time and that the respondent is
thereby deprived of a fair trial.’ – per Goodridge CJN in the case of Regina

v. W.G.G. 58 C.C.C. (3d) 263; [1990] C.C.C. LEXIS 3316 (Newfoundland
Court of Appeal). In any event for the first appellant there should have been
hardly any difficulty in accounting for his movements since it was not in dispute
that being a member of the Cabinet and the Deputy Prime Minister at the
material time his where-abouts at any time were recorded. And as for the second
appellant we would agree that the success or failure of his defence of alibi
should hinge on the alibi of the first appellant.
Bad Faith
As for the second complaint it was submitted that the learned Deputies Public
Prosecutor who conducted the prosecution of these cases were involved in the
fabrication and extortion of evidence against the first appellant and thus tainted
with bad faith in the conduct of their duties. And this contention was based
on the evidence of Mr. Manjeet Singh (‘DW31’) referring to his meeting with
the then Attorney General, the present Attorney General and Dato’ Azhar
Mohamad. The case of Smyth v. Ushewokunza & Anor [1997] SC (we were
not given a complete citation of the case) – a decision of the Supreme Court
of Zimbabwe, was cited in support this complaint. Learned counsel argued that
the principle of fair hearing should be given due respect. Unfortunately learned
counsel for the appellants could only manage to secure a digest of the case.
Hence it is therefore quite difficult for us to consider if indeed this case is of
any help. Anyway even based on the digest copy it would appear that the facts
of that case differed from the present case in that there it was stated that the
prosecutor had personal cause or crusade against the accused. There was no
allegation of that nature in the present case. Thus we are very much in doubt
if the principle in that case is of any relevance to the case before us.
In reply to the foregoing complaint the learned public prosecutor submitted that
the evidence adduced did not tally with the allegation of fabrication or extortion
for evidence and the learned trial judge was correct in finding that such
evidence, for instance the statutory declaration of DW31, was irrelevant. It was
alleged in the declaration that the evidence asked for was on womanizing habit
of the first appellant and nothing to do with sodomy.
Having carefully perused the evidence adduced and the contentions of the
respective learned counsel and the learned public prosecutor we have no
hesitation to agree with the finding of the learned trial judge. We are also in
agreement with the submission of the learned public prosecutor that the evidence
relied upon to indicate fabrication or extortion on the part of the two learned
deputies, Dato’ Gani Patail and Dato’ Azahar Mohamad, who prosecuted this
case, did not support such assertion. The allegation was a demand by the
learned deputies for evidence of womanizing habit of the 1st appellant whereas

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

445

the charge preferred against him was for sodomy. If indeed the learned deputies
were anxiously gathering evidence against the first appellant then it would have
been a futile exercise in what they were alleged to have done. Further, we are
inclined to agree with the learned public prosecutor that it was DW31’s own
deduction and opinion when he said that he was asked to compel his client to
give the required information.

a

b

Thus it is our considered opinion that the assertions and allegations, in particular
of being tainted with bad faith, raised by learned counsel for the appellants
have no basis.
(e) Section 114(g) of the EA 1950
Learned counsel for the appellants argued that the learned trial judge failed to
invoke s. 114(g) of the EA 1950 against the prosecution when it was
appropriate such as when the charges were re-amended and the failure to call
certain persons as witnesses for the prosecution.

c

Now, it should be borne in mind that adverse inference is not to be invoked
liberally by the courts. Indeed it is not in all cases of where there is an act
complained of or a failure or omission to produce or adduce evidence that that
section is relied upon. Only in cases where there has been an intentional
suppression of material or crucial evidence that it may be invoked. Thus, in
the case of Public Prosecutor v. Mansor Md Rashid & Anor [1997] 1 CLJ
233 this is what his Lordship Chong Siew Fai CJ (Sabah and Sarawak) at
p. 254 had to say on the application of that section:

d

Much had been canvassed before us respecting the drawing of adverse
inference under s. 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950 from the non-calling of
Cholar and Amran Whether or not such an inference should be drawn is not
a matter of an inflexible rule but depends upon the circumstances of each
particular case. In determining this issue, the question to consider is whether
the existence of a fact or a state of things (ie, Cholar introducing PW9 and
was present at the meetings; Amran staying in room ‘K’) makes the existence
of another fact or state of things so likely that it may be presumed to exist.
The answer must naturally vary according to the circumstances, the nature of
the fact required to be proved and its importance in the controversy, the usual
and commonly recognized mode of proving it, the nature, quality and cogency
of the evidence which had not been produced and its accessibility to the party
concerned.

Thus it depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. And it should
also be remembered that the calling of witnesses in any prosecution is within
the discretion of the public prosecutor. That was stated in the case of Ti Chuee
Hiang v. PP [1995] 3 CLJ 1 where Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ delivering the grounds
of judgment of the court said this at p. 5:

Current Law Journal

[2003] 4 CLJ

We recognize that the function of the prosecution is to prosecute, and that
does not mean that it must discharge the functions both of the prosecution
and the defence.
On the other hand, it is clear law that the prosecution must have in court
all witnesses from whom statements have been taken, but they have a
discretion whether to call them or not. (See Teh Lee Tong v. PP [1956] MLJ
194.) That discretion, however, must be exercised having regard in the
interests of justice, which includes being fair to the accused (per Lord Parker
CJ in R v. Oliva [1965] 3 All ER 116 at p. 122; [1965] 2 WLR 1028 at
p. 1035), and to call witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on
which the prosecution case is based, whether the effect of their testimony is
for or against the prosecution (per Lord Roche in the Ceylon Privy Council
case of Seneviratne v. R [1936] 3 All ER 36 at p. 49, applied in R v. Nugent
[1977] 3 All ER 662; [1977] 1 WLR 789). (emphasis added).

In particular, to the complaint on the re-amendment of the charges, as discussed
above, it is the prerogative of the prosecution to do so. As such we do not
think it is appropriate to expect the learned trial judge to invoke s. 114(g) in
such instance. Hence, we find no basis to agree with the contention of learned
counsel for the appellants.
On the failure to call certain persons as witnesses it is to be noted that there
is no dispute that these persons were offered to the defence at the end of the
prosecution’s case. Hence there is no ground for the appellants to complain
that they were not available. As to whether they were required in the ‘unfolding
of the narrative on which the prosecution is based’ we are of the view that
having considered the nature of the offences as per charges preferred and the
witnesses called, in particular the victim, there was no necessity for the
prosecution to call them as witnesses. Accordingly we do not think the
invocation of s. 114(g) of EA should arise.
Overall therefore we are not persuaded that there is any merit in any of the
points raised by learned counsel for the appellants under the technical issues
identified hereinabove as to warrant allowing these appeals.
Issues On Merits – The Evidence
As an opening remark we say that it should be appreciated that the commission
of an offence which is sexual in nature involves a minimum of two persons.
And generally during commission there is no independent witness present ‘like
a fly on the wall observing the incriminating episode described’ by a victim
or complainant. Invariably therefore the truth or falsity of such charge will
depend on which version is to be accepted by the court. Credibility of the victim
or complainant as a witness is therefore of paramount importance. And that
explains the need for corroboration or at least a warning of the danger of

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

447

convicting on uncorroborated evidence of such witness. (See: PP v. Mardai
[1950] MLJ 33; Chiu Nang Hong v. PP [1965] 31 MLJ 40). As opined by
the learned trial Judge in the present case it is a charge that is easy to make
but difficult to refute. In order to secure a conviction the evidence must therefore
be convincing particularly the evidence of the victim or complainant. Hence it
is not surprising in these appeals that the credibility of Azizan, one of the three
persons in the alleged incident, became a crucial factor. And indeed the
prosecution heavily relied on his testimony coupled by the retracted confession
of the second appellant and such other corroborative evidence implicating the
guilt of the appellants. On such evidence the learned trial judge found beyond
reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellants as charged. Thus central to these
appeals on the issues of merits are the grievances of the Appellants as to the
appreciation by the learned trial judge of the testimony of Azizan and his
credibility as a witness, the admissibility, truth and trustworthy of the confession
of the second appellant as against the maker and the first appellant and the
probabilities of the defences of alibi, conspiracy and fabrication raised by the
appellants. Of course his identification of corroborative evidence or the lack
of it played an important supportive role.
The Testimony Of Azizan And His Credibility As A Witness
In coming to his finding on the guilt of the appellants the learned trial judge
relied on the testimony of Azizan. Indeed he was prepared to find conviction
of the first appellant solely on the evidence of Azizan. It became therefore the
main thrust of the complaint of the appellants in these appeals that the approach
and appreciation by the learned trial judge of the testimony of the principal
witness and the alleged victim of the offences allegedly committed by the
appellants namely, Azizan, was highly unsatisfactorily in fact and in law. And
for that it is perhaps appropriate to reproduce verbatim the opening remarks
of Mr. Fernando when he began his lengthy submissions thus:
‘prosecution’s case rests on evidence of PW6 – Azizan. Entire case turns on
credibility of Azizan. Learned Judge found PW6 credible, reliable and honest.
We say no. Most unreliable. Riddled with major inconsistencies and outright
lies ... In previous trial before Augustine Paul J he gave evidence which he
admitted during this trial that he was not sodomized by the Appellant. He
said three times and that was why he continued visiting Appellant between
1992 and 1994. Otherwise he would have kept far away from him. PW6
admitted in most unequivocal term. Judge taken aback. Told the Judge to
record it. then Judge said he might have misunderstood. So I put again and
his answer was clear and unequivocal. I asked the third time to be fair to
him. His answer was unequivocal yes. Then after several days during reexamination a leading question was asked which I felt most unfair and ought
to have been rejected. The leading question:
After 1992 were you sodomized again?

Defence objected. Judge allowed. PW6 response was:
Yes I was sodomized but from September 1992 until today (1998) I
was never sodomized.
Witness continued:

b

One incident I will never forget is that I was sodomized by Appellants
at Tivoli Villa.

It was therefore obvious that what were highlighted by the learned counsel were
the apparent inconsistent statements made by Azizan in the first trial as well
as in the present case.
c

d

It was also submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that undue weight
was placed on the credibility of Azizan when none was due and instead he
should have been impeached, that there was hardly any corroboration of his
evidence and that he was an accomplice in the commission of the alleged
offences.
Accordingly the issue of credibility of Azizan was therefore strenuously pursued.
Every possible implication of what he told the learned trial judge was unfolded
before us irrespective of the context in which it was said.

e

f

The Basic Summary Of The Complaints On The Credibility Of Azizan
Learned counsel contended that the learned trial judge gravely erred in fact and
in law in accepting the evidence of Azizan despite the following, namely:
a. the inconsistencies in his evidence particularly on whether he was in fact
sodomized by any of the appellants. References were made to the evidence
of Azizan in the first trial, in particular to his statement when he said
this:
selepas bulan September 1992 sehingga sekarang tertuduh tidak meliwat
saya.;

g

In the present case Azizan told the learned trial judge that he was sodomized
between the months of January and March 1993;
b. for having given three versions of the alleged incident in that three dates
were mentioned as indicated by the amendments to the charges;

h

i

c. for not having given any statement to the police that he was sodomized
yet the dates of 1992 and 1994 appeared in the initial charges and that
the date of 1993 came about on the insistence of or at the behest of the
police;
d. for visiting the house of the first appellant even after the alleged incident
while maintaining that he was scared of being left with him; and

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

449

e. the disclosure by Azizan of bribery to him for his role in making the
allegation against the first appellant.

a

It was also contended that the learned trial judge erred in finding Azizan a
credible witness of truth without appreciating the following, namely:
i. for accepting the explanation of Azizan on the inconsistencies in his
evidence and finding that Azizan had all to lose when in fact he benefited
in that he was made a director and manager of a development company;
ii. for making contradictory findings on the credibility of Azizan. In the course
of the proceeding the learned trial judge made a remark that Azizan was
very evasive and contradictory in his answers yet in his grounds of
judgment the learned trial judge found Azizan to be a highly credible and
reliable witness;
iii. for not taking immediate action against Azizan when he made obvious
contradictory statements in court and to the police, that is, whether or not
he was sodomized;

b

c

d

iv. for accepting the explanation of Azizan as to why he continued to visit
the house of the first appellant between 1992 and 1997;
v. for having two versions in the impeachment proceeding, firstly, the learned
trial judge agreed there were material contradictions in the statements of
Azizan, hence for the impeachment proceeding. However at the end of the
proceeding the learned trial judge ruled that there was no contradiction and
even if there was it had been explained by Azizan;
vi. for making an incomprehensible finding on the inconsistencies in the
testimony of Azizan when it was clear that during the first trial Azizan
made one statement and in the present case he made another contradictory
statement, principally on the issue of whether he was sodomized after
September 1992;
vii. for not allowing the appellants to adduce evidence on the subsequent
conviction of Azizan for khalwat. Such conviction would have gone into
the issue of credibility of Azizan; and

e

f

g

viii. for having mis-recorded the evidence during the impeachment proceeding
which could have bolster the finding on credibility of Azizan as a witness.
The Law
Before we considered the various complaints of the appellants pertaining to the
finding of the learned trial judge on the credibility of Azizan we propose to
have a quick review of the approach adopted by appellate courts in other
common law jurisdictions in so far as it relates to credibility assessment of a

h

i

CLJ



450

a

Current Law Journal

[2003] 4 CLJ

witness by a trial judge. We need only to refer to a few judicial decisions of
high authority.
In Clarke v. Edinburgh Tramways [1919] SC (HL) 35 at p. 36, Lord Shaw
of Dunfermline had this to say at p. 36:

b

c

d

e

When a judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference
with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence, that judgment
is entitled to great respect, and that quite irrespective of whether the Judge
makes any observation with regard to credibility or not. I can of course quite
understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in
which the Judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one
set of witnesses, having seen them and heard them, and does not believe
another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a Court of justice. In
Courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided;
witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their
demeanour, in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their
expressions, in even the turns of the eyelid, left an impression upon the man
who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page.
What in such circumstances, thus psychologically put, is the duty of an
appellate Court? In my opinion, the duty of an appellate Court in those
circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this
case, the question, Am I – who sit here without those advantages, sometimes
broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard
and tried the case - in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a
clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot
be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those privileges was plainly
wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.
(emphasis added).

What then should be the attitude of the Court of Appeal towards the judgment
arrived at in the court below under such circumstances as the present? It is
perfectly true that an appeal is by way of rehearing, but it must not be
forgotten that the Court of Appeal does not rehear the witnesses. It only reads
the evidence and rehears the counsel. Neither is it a reseeing court. There
are different meanings to be attached to the word ‘rehearing’. For example,
the rehearing at Quarter Sessions is a perfect rehearing because, although it
may be the defendant who is appealing, the complainant starts again and has
to make out his case and call his witnesses. The matter is rather different in
the case of an appeal to the Court of Appeal. There the onus is upon the
appellant to satisfy the court that his appeal should be allowed. There have
been a very large number of cases in which the law on this subject has been
canvassed and laid down. There is a difference between the manner in which
the Court of Appeal deals with a judgment after a trial before a judge alone

and a verdict after a trial before a judge and jury. On an appeal against a
judgment of a judge sitting alone, the Court of Appeal will not set aside the
judgment unless the appellant satisfies the court that the judge was wrong
and that his decision ought to have been the other way. (emphasis added).

And nearer home the same legal principles have been adopted both in criminal
and civil cases. For instance in the case of Herchun Singh & Ors v. Public
Prosecutor [1969] 2 MLJ 209 at p. 211 his Lordship HT Ong CJ (Malaya)
said:
This view of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witness must be given
proper weight and consideration. An appellate court should be slow in
disturbing such finding of fact arrived at by the judge, who had the advantage
of seeing and hearing the witness, unless there are substantial and compelling
reasons for disagreeing with the finding: see Sheo Swarup v. King-Emperor
AIR [1934] PC 227.

Again in Lai Kim Hon & Ors v. Public Prosecutor [1981] 1 MLJ 84 his
Lordship Abdul Hamid FJ (as he then was) expressed the law in this fashion
at p. 93:
Viewed as a whole it seems clear that the finding of fact made by the trial
judge turned solely on the credibility of the witnesses. The trial judge heard
the testimony of each witness and had seen him. He also had the opportunity
to observe the demeanour of the witnesses. Discrepancies will always be found
in the evidence of a witness but what a judge has to determine is whether
they are minor or material discrepancies. And which evidence is to be believed
or disbelieved is again a matter to be determined by the trial judge based on
the credibility of each witness. In the final analysis it is for the trial judge
to determine which part of the evidence of a witness he is to accept and which
to reject. Viewed in that light we did not consider it proper for this court to
substitute its findings for that of the learned trial judge.
The principle of law governing appeals in criminal cases on questions of fact
is well established, in that the Appeal Court will not interfere unless the
balance of evidence is grossly against the conviction especially upon a finding
of a specific fact involving the evaluation of the evidence of a witness founded
on the credibility of such witness. (emphasis added).

And in Kandasami Kaliappa Gounder v. Mohd Mustafa Seeni Mohd [1983]
2 CLJ 55; ([1983] CLJ (Rep) 7) PC Lord Brightman said this at p. 57

There is the further problem, that the Federal Court’s finding involved their
acceptance of the defendant’s evidence and their rejection of the plaintiff’s
evidence. The issue was one which depended entirely on an assessment by
the judge of the credibility of the witnesses. The trial judge had found the

defendant to be a most untruthful witness, while he accepted the plaintiff as
a witness of truth. Their Lordships readily defer to the Federal Court’s superior
knowledge of local conditions and attitudes, and recognise their experience
in evaluating the evidence of witnesses drawn from different cultures. But they
feel it important to emphasise the pre-eminent weight which must be attributed
to a trial judge’s finding of fact based upon the credibility of witnesses whom
he has seen and heard under examination and cross-examination, particularly
in relation to a question of fact the answer to which is wholly dependent on
the testimony of such witnesses. Their Lordships respectfully draw attention
to Watt v. Thomas [1947] AC 484 and in particular to the speech of Lord
Thankerton at pages 487 and 488. In their Lordships’ opinion the Federal
Court was not justified in rejecting the finding of the trial judge that the July
Document was not intended by the plaintiff and the defendant to be binding
upon them. (emphasis added).

Another decision of high authority is the case of Goh Leng Kwang v. Teng
Swee Lin & Ors [1974] 2 MLJ 5 although a civil case from Singapore we
find the legal principle restated therein is equally applicable to the present case.
A dispute before the court which entailed a determination on title to a piece
of land the evidence turned on the oral testimonies of the opposing parties and
their witnesses. The trial judge believed one version and rejected the other. On
appeal to the Singapore Court of Appeal by the aggrieved party, the defendant,
the appellate court ruled that ‘for the defendant to succeed in this appeal, he
has to convince us, as an appellate tribunal which has only the trial judge’s
notes of the evidence to work upon and has not seen or heard the witnesses,
that the trial judge was wrong in his crucial findings of fact ... . We are quite
unable to say that on all the evidence before him and having regard to his
assessment of the witnesses and evaluation of their evidence that the trial judge’s
crucial findings of fact are wrong ... . In the final analysis, it was for the
trial judge to balance the probabilities and to evaluate the weight of the
evidence on either side and it is not for this court to do so. The trial judge
has found the two principal witnesses of the plaintiffs were truthful witnesses
and believed their evidence and he has rejected the defendant’s evidence having
found the defendant was not a witness of truth.’ (emphasis added).
Now, did the learned trial judge err in assessing the credibility of Azizan to
such extent that this court should rightly interfere? To better understand the
approach adopted we propose to examine in greater detail what were said by
the learned trial judge. From the grounds of judgment it is apparent that he
has dealt with it primarily from various aspects, inter alia:
(i) from the angle of the impeachment proceeding;

i

[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

453

(ii) on the submissions of learned counsel for the appellants that Azizan made
not only inconsistent statements in the present case but during the first trial
as well. And that his statements in the first trial were inconsistent with
his statements in the present case;
(iii) on the alleged inconsistencies in Azizan’s testimony and that of another
witness;

a

b

(iv) corroborative evidence;
(v) the probability of Azizan being an accomplice; and
(vi) his conviction for khalwat.

c

The Impeachment Proceeding
In respect of the impeachment proceeding and the credibility of Azizan the
learned trial judge said, inter alia:
It can be seen that he made two statements in the earlier trial:
(a) In examination in chief at p 242 of D6 he said:

d

Saya setuju bahawa Dato’ Seri Anwar tidak meliwat saya sebab itulah
saya masih pergi ke rumahnya antara tahun 1992 dan 1997. Jika tidak
saya tentu menjauhkan diri dari rumahnya. (‘the first statement’)
(b) In re-examination at p 273 of D6 he said:

e

Selepas bulan sembilan 1992 sehingga sekarang tertuduh tidak meliwat
saya. (‘the second statement’)
In his testimony from the witness box in the present trial Azizan said he was
sodomized between the months of January and March 1993. I asked Azizan
to explain the contradictions.

f

On examining D6 it appears to me there are material contradictions between
the statements he made in the earlier trial and his evidence in the present
trial.
...
… the question that has to be determined is whether what Azizan had said
in the earlier trial firstly that he was not sodomized by Dato’ Seri Anwar
and that was why he continued to go to Dato’ Seri Anwar’s house between
1992 and 1997 and secondly that he was not sodomized after September 1992
was inconsistent with his evidence in the present trial when he said he was
sodomized between the months of January and March 1993. If there is
inconsistency then the evidence in this instant trial would be disregarded as
unreliable. To determine whether there is such an inconsistency, it is necessary
to look at Azizan’s explanation. His explanation can be found in his testimony
in his own words from the witness box which reads as follows:

Apabila saya katakan saya tidak diliwat selepas Mei 1992, di dalam
perbicaraan dahulu saya maksudkan kejadian diliwat tidak berlaku di
rumahnya. Itu adalah bagi menjawab soalan peguambela mengapa saya
masih berkunjung ke rumah Dato’ Seri Anwar. Kejadian liwat memang
berlaku terhadap saya selepas Mei 1992 dan selepas saya berhenti kerja
tetapi bukan berlaku di rumahnya. Saya juga ada memberitahu semasa
perbicaraan dahulu kejadian tidak dapat saya lupakan berlaku di rumah
Sukma di Tivoli Villa dan saya tidak ditanya tahun bila liwat itu
berlaku. Apabila saya memberi keterangan di hadapan mahkamah ini
itulah sebabnya saya beritahu liwat berlaku di dalam tahun 1993 di
antara bulan Januari dan Mac 1993.
Azizan was cross-examined by Mr Fernando and for the purpose of the
impeachment proceeding it is necessary to refer only to his testimony in
connection with the incident of sodomy which took place in Sukma’s
apartment at Tivoli Villa as stated in his explanation. He agreed with the
suggestion of the learned counsel that he was not sodomized by Dato’ Seri
Anwar and Sukma in May 1992 at Tivoli Villa. As regards the incident which
took place at Sukma’s apartment, Azizan was emphatic that he was sodomized
at Tivoli Villa between the months of January and March 1993 as can be
gathered from the following question and answer:
Question: Adakah awak beritahu polis awak diliwat di antara Januari
hingga Mac 1993 di Tivoli Villa?

e

f

Answer:

Ya, ada.

It was contended by Mr Fernando that Azizan was not telling the truth, it
was SAC-1 Musa, the investigation officer who forced Azizan to change the
date from May 1992 to between January and March 1993. On this point
Azizan was asked:
Question: Jikalau awak cakap benar kenapa SAC-1 Musa suruh awak
pinda tarikh itu dari Mei 1992 ke Januari hingga Mac 1993?
Answer:

g

SAC-1 Musa suruh saya mengingatkan dengan jelas tentang
saya diliwat oleh Dato’ Seri Anwar dan Sukma di Tivoli
Villa.

Question: Ini bermakna jikalau SAC-1 Musa tidak suruh kamu pada
1 Jun 1999 pinda tarikh itu tentu kamu tidak akan buat apaapa?
Answer:
h

Tidak setuju.

Question: Kamu setuju atas tindakan SAC-1 Musa memaksa kamu
meminda tarikh itu daripada Mei 1992 ke Januari hingga
Mac 1993 kerana Tivoli Villa tidak wujud pada bulan Mei
1992?
Answer:

Tidak setuju.

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

It is clear from the answers given by Azizan that he was not forced or asked
by SAC-1 Musa to say that the incident took place between the months of
January and March 1993. SAC-1 Musa only reminded Azizan to be sure of
the incident of sodomy by both the accused at Tivoli Villa. In his evidence
Azizan was emphatic that he was sodomized at Tivoli Villa between January
and March 1993. I find that it was Azizan who told SAC-1 Musa about the
incident at Tivoli Villa and not SAC-1 Musa who forced him to say that he
was sodomized.

455

a

b

...
… both the statements he made in the earlier trial were in answer to questions
which are inter-connected in the sense that they relate to Azizan’s visit to
Dato’ Seri Anwar’s house between 1992 and 1997. The first statement was
made in answer to the question put to the witness in cross examination namely
‘I put it to you, you were not sodomized by Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim and
that is why you continued to visit him in his house between 1992 and 1997
otherwise you would have kept far away’.
The second statement was in answer to the question in re-examination:

c

d

Adakah peristiwa liwat terhadap kamu oleh tertuduh masih berlaku
selepas bulan sembilan 1992?
…
To my mind the two statements are the same in the sense that they are related
to the same incident namely Azizan was sodomized after September 1992.
Azizan in his explanation said what he meant when he said in the earlier
trial that he was not sodomized after May 1992 was that he was not
sodomized in Dato’ Seri Anwar’s house when he was asked ‘mengapa saya
masih berkunjung ke rumah Dato’ Seri Anwar’. He further said without any
reservation in his explanation that ‘kejadian liwat memang berlaku terhadap
saya selepas Mei 1992 dan selepas saya berhenti kerja tetapi bukan di
rumahnya’.
It is to be noted that it is in evidence that Azizan stopped work as a driver
to Datin Seri Dr Wan Azizah at the end of September 1992. It is therefore
crystal clear that his explanation covers the second statement as well. Under
these circumstances, it is futile for the defence counsel to maintain that Azizan
has not explained the second statement he made in the earlier trial. It can
be gathered clearly from his explanation he was sodomized after September
1992 but not in Dato’ Seri Anwar’s house but elsewhere. Azizan is very
consistent with his story that he was not sodomized in the house but elsewhere
after September 1992. He said this in the earlier trial where he said:

e

f

g

h

Salah satu perbuatan yang tidak dapat saya lupakan ialah peristiwa di
rumah Sukma di Tivoli Villa di mana tertuduh telah meliwat saya
dahulu dan diikuti dengan adik angkatnya meliwat saya.

[2003] 4 CLJ

He also gave similar evidence to this effect in his testimony before this court
with the addition that he was sodomized at Tivoli Villa between the months
of January and March 1993.
On a close scrutiny of the explanation by Azizan, I find no difficulty in
accepting it under the circumstances and on the evidence available. The
explanation is logical and not inherently incredible bearing in mind the
questions that were posed to him. The statements in question which form the
basis of the impeachment of Azizan must be read in the context of the
questions that were asked. I find that there is in fact no contradiction at all
between what he had said in the previous trial and the evidence he gave in
this instant proceedings in respect of the act of sodomy as stated in the charges
against both accused. In any event, even assuming that there is a material
contradiction I am more than satisfied that Azizan has successfully explained
the contradiction for reasons stated above beyond any doubt. I, therefore, ruled
that the impeachment proceeding failed and the credit of Azizan was saved
and remained intact and further that in truth, in fact and in substance Azizan
was a truthful witness.

With respect we find nothing wrong in the conclusion of the learned trial judge
for not impeaching the credit of Azizan. He accepted his explanation for the
seemingly contradictory statements which gave the apparent impression that they
were contrary to his allegation against the appellants. Indeed in such proceedings
it is the trial judge who has the advantage of listening and seeing the demeanour
of the witness giving his explanation for his inconsistent statements. Hence his
acceptance of the explanation should be given significant consideration. In Ooi
Choon Lye v. Lim Boon Kheng & Ors [1972] 1 MLJ 153 it was observed
that as the learned trial judge ‘based his decision on the opinion he formed as
to the comparative reliability of witnesses, it was not open to the Federal Court,
as an appellate court, to interfere with that decision’. In the present case we
have no reason to depart from that observation.
It was also contended that the learned trial judge made two inconsistent findings
in the impeachment proceeding in that on one hand he found contradictions in
the statements of Azizan and on the other he found none.
With respect such submission omitted the fact that it was essential for the
learned trial judge to note the contradictions before he could allow the
impeachment proceeding. Indeed the very purpose of an impeachment proceeding
is to enable a witness to explain any material contradiction in his testimony
presently given or in relation to his previous statement on the same issue. And
it is up to the learned trial judge having heard the explanation to assess his
credit ‘as a whole with the rest of the evidence at the appropriate stage, that
is to say, at the close of the case for the prosecution or for the defence as the
case may be. No immediate order of a summary nature can or should be made

… and the right of cross examination or re-examination according to the
circumstances should not be denied as it might well be that in the exercise of
such right his credit might be repaired, restored or re-establish’ – per Eusoff
Abdoolcader FJ in Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim v. PP [1983] 2 MLJ 232.
Accordingly we find no merit in such submission.
The Inconsistent Statements Of Azizan
It was the contention of learned counsel for the appellants that Azizan should
not be accepted as a reliable witness since he made inconsistent
statements. References were made to his evidence as recorded in the notes of
evidence of the first trial and his evidence in the present case.
In addressing the issue the learned trial judge, inter alia, relied on his findings
in the impeachment proceeding wherein he concluded that by his refusal to
impeach Azizan his credit was therefore saved. And in respect of the change
in the date of the alleged incident the learned trial judge came to a finding
thus, inter alia:

a

b

c

d

… It can be gathered from his explanation that what he meant by saying that
it was SAC-1 Musa who asked him to change the date was that SAC-1 Musa
asked him to remember the date clearly with regard to the incident that took
place at Tivoli Villa for the first time.

It was found by the learned trial judge that the evidence of SAC1 Musa
corroborated the explanation of Azizan on the issue, hence there was no question
of Azizan making an inconsistent statement. In making his finding the learned
trial judge said this:
This evidence corroborates what Azizan had said that it was he who told SAC1 Musa of the date, ie between January and March 1993 as stated in the
charges against both the accused. I accept the evidence of SAC-1 Musa on
this issue as I find there is no reason why he should ask Azizan to change
the date. He was only carrying out his duties as an Investigation Officer. He
felt that there is a likelihood the date stated in the charge may not be accurate
after carrying out further investigations on receipt of the notice of alibi. It is
clear on the evidence adduced and under the circumstances of the case Azizan
was not asked by SAC-1 Musa to change the date. I am convinced that it
was Azizan who told SAC-1 Musa that he was sodomized by both the accused
between January and March 1993 at Tivoli Villa. I find as a fact that Azizan
was telling the truth.

e

f

g

h

It was also submitted that while under cross-examination Azizan gave
inconsistent answers. However the learned trial judge came to his findings thus:
A close scrutiny of the evidence would reveal that he was asked repeatedly
in cross examination whether he told the police he was sodomized in May
1994 and May 1992.

CLJ

i



458

a

Current Law Journal

[2003] 4 CLJ

...
It is to be observed that May 1994 and May 1992 are not the months we are
concerned with in the instant charges against both the accused. These months
are relevant only in respect of the earlier charges which have been amended.
We are not concerned with these charges.

b

c

…
In his testimony Azizan said he was confused because he was asked about
the months of May 1994 and May 1992 repeatedly as stated above. I find as
a fact that he was confused. When a witness is confused, it does not mean
he was lying. The naked truth is that he could not remember what he had
said. I am satisfied he was not lying. In any event, the issue whether he told
the police he was sodomized in May 1994 and May 1992 are not the issues
in the current charges against both the accused. The issue is whether he was
sodomized by both the accused between the months of January and March
1993 at Tivoli Villa. I therefore rule the credit of Azizan is not affected on
this score. (emphasis added).

d

Next dealt with but still on the issue of inconsistent statements and the
credibility of Azizan was in reference to his statements to the police and the
evidence of the Investigation Officer, SAC1 Musa, on the allegation of sodomy.
Having considered the evidence the learned trial judge came to this finding:
e

f

g

h

i

Be that as it may, the evidence of SAC-1 Musa clearly states that Azizan
was consistent in his statements on the issue of sodomy although he was not
sure of the exact dates. The relevant dates we are concerned with in the
present charges are between the months of January and March 1993. Azizan
emphatically said in evidence that he was sodomized by both Dato’ Seri Anwar
and Sukma at Tivoli Villa between these dates and he gave the reasons for
remembering the dates. This evidence was not successfully challenged. It is
therefore established on this evidence that Azizan was sodomized by both Dato’
Seri Anwar and Sukma in Tivoli Villa between January to March 1993.
Whether he was sodomized in May 1994 or May 1992 is not relevant as these
dates are not in issue to be decided in this case.

We find the analysis by the learned trial judge on the inconsistent statements
comprehensive and well reasoned. It was also partly based on his finding of
the factual situation when Azizan gave his evidence. As to the discrepancies
on the details we need only to note what was said by his Lordship Abdul
Hamid J (as he then was) in Chean Siong Guat v. PP [1969] 2 MLJ 63 at
p. 64:
Absolute truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions
of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common
occurrence. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in
observation, retention and recollection are often recognized by the court.

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

459

And in the case of Khoon Chye Hin v. Public Prosecutor [1961] MLJ 105 it
was held that “… If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points
then it is clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence
the rest of his evidence must be scrutinised with great care and indeed with
suspicion. To say, however, that because a witness has been proved a liar on
one or two points then the whole of his evidence “must in law be rejected” is
to go too far and is wrong.” per Thomson CJ at p. 107.
Surely therefore it would be wrong in law to wholesale reject the evidence of
Azizan just because he faltered in few instances in the course of his testimony.
Indeed discrepancies found in the testimony of a witness may be evidence of
his truthfulness rather than the reverse. (See also: Dato’ Mokhtar bin Hashim
& Anor v. Public Prosecutor (supra).
It should also be noted that those apparent inconsistent statements of Azizan
during the first trial became the reason for the commencement of the
impeachment proceeding. But with the conclusion arrived at by the learned trial
judge in respect of the impeachment proceeding, any subsequent reliance on
those very statements as positive evidence for the trial proper should be
disallowed. (See: Public Prosecutor v. Lo Ah Eng [1965] 1 MLJ 241; Public
Prosecutor v. Wong Yee Sen and Ors. [1990] 1 CLJ 325; [1990] 2 CLJ (Rep)
902). There are also limits to the use of evidence adduced in a previous trial.
(See: Sambasivam v. The Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya [1950] MLJ
145; Thavanathan a/l Balasubramaniam v. Public Prosecutor [1997] 3 CLJ
150). And there was no assertion from learned counsel for the appellants that
reliance was placed on the previous statements of Azizan for their truth.
Basically it was only referred to in an attempt to undermine the credibility of
Azizan as a witness. And such record of the previous inconsistent statement is
only admissible if the witness denies making that inconsistent statement. The
mere fact that the record contains the inconsistencies does not make it admissible
wholesale. More so in the present case the admission of D6 was not for the
purpose of making those transcripts positive evidence for the trial.

On Corroboration
As regards the testimony of Azizan and the law of corroboration it was the
contention of learned counsel for the appellants that being an unreliable witness
there should be no question of corroboration of the evidence of Azizan. The
case of TN Nathan v. Public Prosecutor [1978] 1 MLJ 134 was cited in
support. Alternatively it was submitted that in view of the nature of the offences
as per charges the law demands that the evidence of Azizan must be
corroborated. And in this case there was no corroborative evidence contrary to
the finding of the learned trial judge.

a

Now, in his grounds of judgment the learned trial judge restated the law thus:

b

It is therefore trite law that a complainant’s evidence in a sexual offence
requires corroboration although a conviction founded on the uncorroborated
evidence of the complainant is not illegal provided that the presiding judge
must warn himself of the danger of convicting on such uncorroborated
evidence (see Chiu Nang Hong v. PP [1965] 31 MLJ 40).

c

d

e

f

g

h

i

We have no doubt on the correctness of the restatement of the law. What
therefore is the position of Azizan in this context? Was the overall finding of
the learned trial judge of him being a truthful and reliable witness justified?
For if Azizan was not a reliable and truthful witness then there should be no
issue of corroboration of his evidence.
Azizan A Reliable And Truthful Witness?
We have dealt with this issue earlier on in this judgment in response to the
criticism on the credibility of Azizan advanced by learned counsel for the
appellants. Put shortly it was the finding of the learned trial judge that Azizan
was a reliable, credible and truthful witness notwithstanding some of the
discrepancies and contradictions that were highlighted by the defence.
Bearing therefore in the forefront of our minds such finding, we therefore ask
ourselves: Can we – ‘who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad
and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the judge who heard and tried
the case – in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear
conclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong?’
We have given our anxious consideration to the complaints of the appellants,
whether or not specifically dealt with herein, on the findings of the learned
trial judge in relation to his assessment on the credibility of Azizan but we
are unable to say that the learned trial judge was plainly wrong in coming to
his findings as he did. In fact we find that the learned trial judge went quite
far to ensure that Azizan was duly scrutinized as a witness. He allowed an
impeachment proceeding to be conducted so that all parties could be heard on
the apparent discrepancies in the statements and testimonies of Azizan. If indeed
he was inclined from the start to favour Azizan as a witness then it would
have been convenient for him just to rule that the discrepancies as found were
minor and required no further proceeding. He did not, but instead went into
detail examination of the evidence given by Azizan in order to arrived at a
proper conclusion. Plainly therefore being an appellate court we should be slow
in substituting our own assessment of Azizan as a witness. (See: Periasamy
s/o Sinnappan & Anor v. PP [1996] 3 CLJ 187 CA). As such that finding
should be accepted as the correct assessment of Azizan. After all on the issue
of whether to accept or reject the evidence of a witness the ‘real tests are how
consistent the story is with itself, how it stands the test of cross-examination

and how far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of
the case’ per Lord Roche in Bhojraj v. Sita Ram [1936] AIR 60 PC at p. 62.
(See also: Dato’ Mokhtar bin Hashim & Anor v. Public Prosecutor (supra).
Thus, as we agree with the learned trial Judge that in view of his finding of
Azizan being a truthful and reliable witness the legal principle as restated in
TN Nathan v. Public Prosecutor (supra) has no application.
There was a complaint by the appellants that the learned trial judge could not
have found Azizan a truthful and credible witness in view of his remark of
him being ‘evasive and appears to me not to answer simple question put to
him’ during the hearing.
From the notes of proceeding there is no denial that such remark was made.
However the question is in what context and whether the learned trial judge
was bound by it even with the advantage of considering the testimony of Azizan
as a whole.
If the contention of learned counsel for the appellants were to be acceded then
that would run contrary to an established legal principle expounded in a civil
case of Yuill v. Yuill [1945] 1 All ER 183 and ruled as equally applicable in
criminal cases by a local case of Tara Singh & Ors v. Public Prosecutor
[1949] MLJ 88 in that ‘an impression as to the demeanour of a witness ought
not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of the
evidence of the witness in question’. (See also: Public Prosecutor v. Ku Lip
See [1982] 1 MLJ 194).

Accordingly the complaint is inconsequential in so far as it relates to the finding
by the learned trial judge on the credibility of Azizan.

The Corroborative Evidence
The next issue is whether the learned trial judge was correct in his finding of
corroborative evidence adduced. He found the following as corroborative
evidence to the testimony of Azizan:

g

(i) The conduct of first appellant in ‘asking Azizan to deny his ‘Pengakuan
Bersumpah’ (‘P5’) which was sent to the Prime Minister, and secondly,
by asking SAC1 Musa, the investigation officer to close the investigation
related to the police report lodged by his aide DSP Zull Aznam. The report
was lodged after an anonymous letter entitled ‘Talqin Kutuk Anwar
Ibrahim’ surfaced wherein it made allegations of sexual misconduct on the
part of the first appellant. It was the evidence of SAC1 Musa as
summarized by the learned trial judge that ‘his findings that the allegations
against Dato’ Seri Anwar contained therein were not totally unfounded. The
allegations were not fully and completely investigated despite the existence

of ample evidence that warranted a full investigation because Dato’ Seri
Anwar requested him to stop investigation’. The learned trial judge went
on to say this:
This is evidence which is relevant to help the court to come to a
finding of fact whether there was indeed fabrication of evidence in
respect of sodomy alleged to be committed by Dato’ Seri Anwar
Ibrahim. It is startling to note that the defence did not touch on this
aspect of the evidence. Be that as it may, in my opinion, this evidence
of conduct of Dato’ Seri Anwar is a circumstance telling against him
which he has to explain. This evidence is relevant where it would lend
support to show that the accused is guilty (see Chandrasekaran & Ors
v. PP [1971] 1 MLJ 153).

(ii) The confession of Sukma (P4). It was the conclusion of the learned trial
judge that the confession of the second appellant was made voluntarily,
hence admissible. Further it was his finding that ‘the relevant part of the
confession which is in respect of the commission of sodomy by both Dato’
Seri Anwar and Sukma on Azizan is true and reliable’. And he held that
‘the confession (P4) sufficiently supports and corroborates Azizan’s
evidence.
The Law On Corroborative Evidence
The nature of corroborative evidence is a subject which has been exhaustively
discussed in major cases by the apex courts in several jurisdictions. And the
learned trial judge in the present case rightly referred to some of them when
he said this:
The word corroboration had no special technical meaning; by itself it meant
no more than evidence tending to confirm other evidence (see Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Kilbourne [1973] 1 All ER 440). It has also been said
that what is required is some additional evidence rendering it probable that
the story of the complainant is true and that it is reasonably safe for the court
to act upon the evidence. In the celebrated case of R v. Baskerville [1916] 2
KB 658 at p. 667 Viscount Reading LCJ said:

h

We hold that the evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect
him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which
implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not
only the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the
prisoner committed it.

i

It has also been held that corroborative evidence is not necessarily restricted
to the oral evidence of an independent witness. Corroboration can equally be
well afforded by established facts and the logic of established facts sometimes
speaks even more eloquently than words (see Brabakaran v. PP [1966] 1 MLJ
64.

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

463

Further, corroboration ‘may be found in independent evidence or in admissions
of the prisoner, or in inferences properly drawn from his conduct and statements.
And it is, in our opinion, for the jury in the present case to say what
complexion the conduct and statements of the prisoner bear’. (See: Eade v.
The King [1924] 34 CLR 154, at p. 158). In other words, whether or not the
conduct and statement of an accused person has the effect of being corroborative
evidence is for the trial court to consider.
The Statutory Declaration (P5) Of Azizan And The Conduct Of First
Appellant In Asking Him To Retract It And For SAC1 Musa To Stop
Investigation: Corroborative Evidence?
It is to be noted that the learned trial judge found that the act of the first
appellant in asking Azizan to deny the content of P5 was corroborative evidence
in nature and that it was relevant by virtue of s. 8 of EA 1950. With respect
we are inclined to agree with his finding. There was no challenge from either
of the appellants to the prosecution’s assertion that the first appellant had asked
Azizan to deny the content of P5.
Similarly it was also found by the learned trial judge as relevant under s. 8
of EA 1950 as well as being corroborative evidence the action of first appellant
in instructing SAC1 Musa to cease investigation in connection with the police
report No. 2706/96 lodged earlier on by ASP Aznam. We agree with his
conclusion. Surely it should be reasonable for the learned trial judge having
heard the evidence to make an inference from such unchallenged facts that such
conduct had an ulterior motive and done for the benefit of the first appellant
and thus categorizing the same as ‘evidence tending to confirm other evidence’
although such evidence could not be said to be directly in relation to the offence
as per charge.
Confession Of Second Appellant: Corroborative Evidence?
And as for the confession of Sukma (P4) we also agree with the learned trial
judge that after finding the confession as having being made voluntarily and
admitted in evidence the same should have corroborative effective on the
evidence of Azizan. But it was also submitted that once retracted as in the
present case such confession could no longer corroborate.
With respect we are of the view that such approach is not in consonant with
the accepted legal principle. In the case of Tinit & Ors v. Public Prosecutor
(No. 2) [1964] MLJ 389 McGilligan J was of the opinion that retracted
confessions ‘once found to have been voluntarily made – were very good
corroboration’. That in our view makes sense for it is settled law that a
confession on its own, even if subsequently retracted so long as the court is
satisfied of its voluntariness and truth, can be a basis to convict an accused
person. (See: Osman & Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1967] 1 MLJ 137 FC;

[1968] 2 MLJ 137 PC; Yap Sow Keong & Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1947]
MLJ 90; Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim v. PP (supra). There is therefore is no reason
why it cannot be good corroborative evidence.
Accordingly in the present case the finding of the learned trial judge as to the
corroborative effect of the confession of the second appellant to the evidence
of Azizan is justified. Hence we are therefore unable to accept the submission
of learned counsel for the appellants that the confession having been retracted
should not have been taken as corroborative evidence.
Evidence Of PW2 – Dr. Mohd. Fadzil And PW3 – Tun Hanif Omar
The prosecution also submitted as corroborative evidence the evidence of Dr.
Mohd. Fadzil – PW2. However the learned trial judge held that his evidence
could not corroborate the evidence of Azizan as it ‘does not confirm the story
of Azizan that he was sodomized by both the accused’. From that perspective
that may be correct. However we are of the view that in so far as it relates
to the confession of the second appellant (P4), it is definitely relevant. Thus
on that score we differ with the learned trial judge. Otherwise we agree with
his reasoning pertaining to the admissibility of the testimony of PW2 on other
issues.
As for the testimony of Tun Hanif Omar – PW3, it was ruled by the learned
trial judge as hearsay his evidence on the issue of unusual sex activities
involving the first appellant with three named persons based on a Special Branch
investigation. The learned trial judge reasoned that none of the officers involved
in the investigation or the alleged three persons who allegedly had sexual
activities with the first appellant was called to testify. On that basis we are
inclined to agree with him.
However, the fact that Tun Hanif did speak to the first appellant and the
response he received should be admitted as relevant. There was no dispute to
the assertion of Tun Hanif that the first appellant did not protest when he was
told to stop his wayward activity. Surely one would have registered his
disapproval to the assertion instead of just asking whether he would be subject
to blackmail by the police. In R v. Chandler [1976] 1 WLR 585 CA Lawton
LJ in the course of his judgment said this at p. 589:
The law has long accepted that an accused person is not bound to incriminate
himself; but it does not follow that a failure to answer an accusation or
question when an answer could reasonably be expected may not provide some
evidence in support of an accusation. Whether it does will depend upon the
circumstances.

Azizan An Accomplice?
It was also the contention of learned counsel for the appellants that Azizan
was an accomplice and hence his evidence would require corroboration or at
least a warning by the learned trial judge of the danger of convicting based
on uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. It was also reiterated that the
charges, of sexual offences in nature, corroboration or at least a warning of
the danger to convict on uncorroborated evidence would be prudent.
We have carefully reviewed the grounds of judgment of the learned trial judge
on these points and we find no reason to differ from his conclusions. The
learned trial judge held that Azizan was not an accomplice in these words:
The case laid down the principle that when an accomplice acts under a form
of pressure which it would require some firmness to resist reliance can be
placed on his uncorroborated evidence.
In the instant case the evidence shows that Azizan was invited to visit Tivoli
Villa by Sukma. Azizan went there to see Sukma’s new apartment. He went
there not with the intention of committing sodomy with both the accused. His
actus reus alone is not sufficient to make him an accomplice, there must also
be the intention on his part (see Ng Kok Lian’s case). For the reasons I
therefore find that Azizan is not an accomplice.

In any event, overall, the learned trial judge did warn himself of the danger of
convicting an accused person in sexual cases on uncorroborated evidence. In
our view such a direction should suffice for the purpose of the present case.
The Conviction Of Azizan For Khalwat
The conviction of Azizan for the offence of khalwat before the Syariah Court
in Alor Gajah Melaka was also brought up by learned counsel for the appellants
with the view to undermine his credibility as a witness. The learned trial judge
held that:
What transpired in the Syariah Court would not be relevant in assessing the
credibility of Azizan. It has been held that a conviction of a witness for an
offence is not a ground for disbelieving a witness (see Gipp v. R [1998] 155
ALR 15 – High Court of Australia). It follows therefore the mere fact that
Azizan was convicted in the Syariah Court under the Syariah law is no ground
for discrediting his evidence given in the instant trial and to disbelieve him.

Question On Re-examination Of Azizan And Allegation Of Mis-recording
As regards the issue of re-examination learned counsel for the first appellant
was relating more to the event in the first trial which was the cause for the
impeachment proceeding during the hearing of the present case. In short it was

i

CLJ



466

a

b

Current Law Journal

[2003] 4 CLJ

the submission of learned counsel that due to what transpired in the first trial
the answer of Azizan after the re-examination thereof should not be believed
as he was then only parroting the words of the then learned Deputy Prosecutor.
For clarity it is perhaps appropriate here to briefly refer to that portion of the
evidence of Azizan during his cross-examination in the first trial, inter alia:
… Saya setuju bahawa Dato’ Seri Anwar tidak meliwat saya sebab itulah saya
masih pergi ke rumahnya antara tahun 1992 dan 1997. Jika tidak saya tentu
menjauhkan diri saya dari rumahnya.

c

d

e

In re-examination Azizan was asked to explain what he meant by that answer.
And he said this, inter alia:
Selepas bulan sembilan 1992 sehingga sekarang tertuduh tidak meliwat saya
… Salah satu perbuatan yang tidak dapat saya lupakan ialah peristiwa di
rumah Sukma di Tivoli Villa di mana tertuduh telah meliwat saya dahulu dan
diikuti dengan adik angkatnya meliwat saya.

It was the last part of the answer that was strenuously objected to by learned
counsel for the appellants contending that that was not part of the crossexamination. And it became one of the foundations for the impeachment
proceeding in the present case. Hence Azizan was therefore asked to explain
the contradiction.
The explanation given was inter alia:
Kejadian liwat memang berlaku terhadap saya selepas bulan Mei 1992 dan
selepas saya berhenti kerja tetapi bukan berlaku di rumahnya.

f

g

h

It was the argument of learned counsel for the appellants that such explanation
should not be given any credence in view of what transpired in the first trial.
However the learned trial judge came to his finding on the issue in this way:
To my mind the two statements are the same in the sense that they are related
to the same incident namely Azizan was sodomized after September 1992.
Azizan in his explanation said what he meant when he said in the earlier
trial that he was not sodomized after May 1992 was that he was not
sodomized in Dato’ Seri Anwar’s house when he was asked ‘mengapa saya
masih berkunjung ke rumah Dato’ Seri Anwar’. He further said without any
reservation in his explanation that ‘kejadian liwat memang berlaku terhadap
saya selepas Mei 1992 dan selepas saya berhenti kerja tetapi bukan di
rumahnya’.

Now, the rule in re-examination is clear in that it is confined to matters touched
on during cross-examination. Fresh evidence adding to or re-affirming evidencein-chief is not permitted in re-examination.
i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

467

Learned Public Prosecutor however argued that the question asked was to clarify
on matters pertaining to being sodomized and permissible under s. 138 of EA
1950 which reads:
The re-examination shall be directed to the explanation of matters referred to
in cross-examination; and if new matter is, by permission of the court,
introduced in re-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine
upon that matter.

Having considered the respective contentions we are inclined to agree with the
argument of the latter. The question is not totally out of context on matters
raised earlier. Azizan was only asked to explain his earlier answer which prima
facie appeared to be contradictory. At any rate it could not be said that learned
counsel for the appellants were totally shut out at the material time. Surely
they could have asked for leave to further cross-examine Azizan if indeed they
felt that undue advantage was taken during the re-examination.
Accordingly we find no material substance in the complaint relating to the reexamination of Azizan and in our view no miscarriage of justice had occasioned
when the learned trial judge overruled the objection.
There was also a complaint from learned counsel for the first appellant that
the learned trial judge mis-recorded the evidence during the impeachment
proceeding by the addition of two words to the evidence of Azizan, hence gave
him greater credibility. According to learned counsel at p. 1028 of the Appeal
Record the two words added were ‘dan bukan’ to his question which reads in
the context as follows:
S: Adakah awak beritahu pihak polis kamu diliwat oleh Dato’ Seri Anwar
dan bukan dalam tahun 1994?

a

b

c

d

e

f

J: Ada.
S: Adakah tidak sebelum hari ini awak ada memberitahu mahkamah ini
bahawa awak tidak ada memberitahu polis bahawa awak di liwat oleh
Dato’ Seri Anwar dan Sukma pada tahun 1994?

g

J: Ada. (Words complained of are in bold).

With respect we are unable to agree that the mere addition of the two words
gave Azizan greater credibility. Surely the whole of his testimony has to be
considered and not those words alone. Further, they have to be considered in
the context of what were said overall. In addition, the legal principle on the
finality to the contents of the notes of evidence recorded by a trial judge is
quite clear. Not being the trial court, an appellate court has to rely on the
learned trial Judge’s notes of evidence. (See: Cheow Chew Khoon (t/a Cathay
Hotel) v. Abdul Johari bin Abdul Rahman [1995] 1 MLJ 457; Loh Kwang
Seang v. Public Prosecutor [1960] MLJ 271).

Hence, we cannot accede to the request of learned counsel for the first appellant
that those two words should be ignored or that they had an impact in the
perception of the learned trial judge on the credibility of Azizan. In passing
we note that this point was not raised at the first opportunity available thereby
affecting its credence.
No Medical Examination Of Azizan
It was also the submission of learned counsel for the first appellant that since
there was no medical report of Azizan and since he was not sent for medical
examination there was no best corroborative evidence available. Further, it was
urged upon this court that adverse inference should be drawn for such failure.
And it was also submitted that the learned trial judge should have found SAC1
Musa, the investigation officer, in contempt of court since he openly contradicted
himself in court.
The learned trial judge found that there was no contradiction in the answers
of SAC1 Musa as he was answering different questions. Further, it was also
his finding that medical evidence was not the only method in which penetration
could be established. And such view is not without any basis. In fact we find
merit in the argument of the learned public prosecutor that based on the
evidence of an expert called by the appellants, namely Dr. Zahari (DW3) it is
obvious that after a lapse of time medical examination is not a reliable mean
and not the only method to determine whether or not a person has been
sodomized.
In respect of an adverse inference to be drawn for the failure of SAC1 Musa
to send Azizan for medical examination we do not think it is within the scope
of s. 114(g) of EA 1950. In view of what transpired there was nothing to
indicate that there was an intentional suppression of evidence or an attempt to
do so. (See: Pendakwa Raya v. Mansor Mohd Rashid & Anor [1997] 1 CLJ
233) (supra).

h

Disclosure Of Bribery By Azizan
Another criticism in the finding of the learned trial judge on the reliability of
Azizan as a witness is his failure to properly consider the bribery allegation.
It was submitted for the first appellant that it was wrong for the learned trial
judge to lightly put aside the evidence of DSP Zull Aznam who testified that
Azizan had told him that it was on a promise of payment that he made the
accusation against the first appellant.

i

In his finding the learned trial judge did not attach any weight to the evidence
of DSP Zull Aznam on the issue of bribery. Reasons for doing so were given
and having considered them we have no basis to differ. After all the ‘credibility
of a witness is primarily a matter for the trial judge’. (See: Dato Mokhtar bin

g

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

469

Hashim & Anor v. Public Prosecutor) (supra). We also agree with the learned
trial judge that being a senior police officer DSP Zull Aznam would have no
problem in having such crucial piece of information recorded when he gave
his two statements to the police in connection with his police report No. 2706/
97 (exh. D44) dated 15 August 1997. DSP Zull Aznam’s explanation for the
failure was that he was not sure of the truth of what Azizan told him. In our
view such reason is weak and unconvincing. It is not therefore surprising for
the learned trial judge to come to such conclusion as he did.
In addition, it was the evidence of Azizan that he made no such disclosure
and could not have done so since he did not meet DSP Zull Aznam after his
meeting with the first appellant. And he denied such suggestion under crossexamination.
Fabrication Of The Allegation By Azizan?
Learned counsel for the first appellant also submitted that the accusation of
Azizan against the first appellant was a fabrication, pure and simple. And that
it was a political conspiracy against the first appellant.
There was no denial that after the making of P5 Azizan went to see Mr. Karpal
Singh who was then a Member of Parliament and a practising lawyer for
advice. Learned public prosecutor submitted that if indeed there was a political
conspiracy and that what Azizan alleged was part of it and a fabrication, there
was no reason for him to see Mr. Karpal Singh to seek for advice and probably
assistance. It was also the evidence of Azizan that Mr. Karpal Singh promised
to bring up the matter in Parliament.
This aspect of the case was not addressed to by learned counsel for the first
appellant at the appeal. Accordingly we are of the view that what the learned
public prosecutor has surmised is not without merit. The move by Azizan to
see Mr. Karpal Singh and the absence of any rebuttal from the first appellant
on this issue made the assertion of fabrication a non-starter. And indeed it must
have been the case since SAC1 Musa found no trace of evidence of conspiracy
or fabrication of sort.
We are therefore of the view that this act of Azizan in consulting a lawyer
for advice at that time when there was no hint of any prosecution against
anyone only adds to his credibility and at the same time demolishing any theory
of fabrication on his part or that he was under the influence of someone else
writing the script for the downfall of the first appellant.

Azizan Did Not Make Police Report Earlier
It is not in dispute that Azizan did not lodge any police report pertaining to
his allegation of having being sodomized by the appellants. And for this failure
it was contended for the appellants that his allegation must be taken with
suspicion.
In the course of his testimony Azizan was asked for his failure to lodge any
Police report. He gave his explanation one of which was that he did not think
anyone would believe him let alone the police. He was conscious of the
important position of the first appellant at that time. It was only after his
conversation with one Umi Halifida that he had the idea of making P5 which
was then sent to the Prime Minister. He was of the view that the Prime Minister
was higher than the first appellant at that time. But P5 did not bring the desired
result in that Azizan was instead arrested and made to retract its contents.
This issue was not specifically considered by the learned trial judge when he
dealt with the credibility of Azizan. Nevertheless having heard and seen Azizan
in the witness box and for other reasons that he gave, he found Azizan to be
a truthful witness. Surely therefore it can be safely assumed that he must have
taken into account this issue before coming to his conclusion. On our part we
have read the explanation of Azizan and we are of the opinion that it is
perfectly plausible taking into account his station in life.
At any rate failure to lodge a police report is not fatal to the prosecution and
it is not a prerequisite for the commencement of an investigation by the police.
After all at best a police report is either to show consistency or to contradict
an informant’s evidence in court. (See: Apren Joseph v. State of Kerala [1973]
Cri LJ 185; Hairani bin Sulong v. Public Prosecutor [1993] 2 CLJ 79). In
the case of Public Prosecutor v. Foong Chee Cheong [1970] 1 MLJ 97 it
was held that ‘… However important a document a first information report is,
it can never be treated as a piece of substantive evidence and the fact that no
first information report was made is not in itself a ground for throwing out a
case.’ per Gill J (as he then was) at p. 97. In our view that is a correct
expression of the law on the point.
Azizan Coming Back To Work For Datin Azizah
A question was also posed by learned counsel for the first appellant to drive
home a point that Azizan should not be believed. He argued that if indeed
Azizan was sodomized by the first appellant there was no reason for him to
return to work for Datin Seri Wan Azizah in 1994.
Azizan was asked the same question in the witness box. His reply was that he
tried to return to work but could only withstand for two weeks as he was
worried of what had happened to him before might occur again. In fact prior

to being asked this question he was asked why he continued to work for Datin
Seri Wan Azizah after the first time he was sodomized by the first appellant.
His answer was that he was then still confused and distraught. He also had
great respect for Datin Seri Wan Azizah and that her children were close to
him.
There appears to be no specific finding by the learned trial judge on this point.
But one thing is clear. There was no contrary evidence tendered by the first
appellant to rebut the explanation given. Hence it can safely be accepted as a
credible explanation under such circumstances. (See: Rattan Singh v. Public
Prosecutor [1971] 1 MLJ 162; Ryan v. Ross & Anor. [1963] 2 QB 151).
The Details Of The Incident Given By Azizan And Finding Of Facts In
Relation To Azizan’s Credibility
The learned trial judge further came to his finding on the credibility of Azizan
based on his detailed account of the incident. Learned counsel for the first
appellant submitted that such account should not be accepted as anyone could
have done the same by just watching pornographic movies.
With respect we do not think it would be that simple. If Azizan were rehearsing
it from a movie that he had seen then surely he could not have withstood the
cross-examination from the defence team that spanned for seven days. It would
not have been easy for anyone, let alone a mere driver, to maintain consistency
in his answers of the incident if indeed the details were ‘acted’ from a movie.
Moreover the learned trial judge was there to watch his demeanour and other
indicators while in the witness box. These are factors which we are not
privileged to observe at the appellate stage, hence the finding of the learned
trial judge has to be given serious consideration and weight that it deserves.
(See: Bhojraj v. Sitaram (supra); Ooi Choon Lye v. Lim Boon Kheng & Ors
(supra).
There are also other findings of facts of the learned trial judge that led him to
believe Azizan and finding him credible. And these findings did not come by
without justifications. The learned trial judge was well aware that for an offence
as in this case it would be easy to allege but difficult to rebut. And for that
he took all the precautions to ensure that all the legal requirements in
determining the truthfulness of Azizan were met. He also allowed impeachment
proceeding thus enabling all parties to hear the explanation of Azizan for the
apparent contradictions in his statements. And in the process he found factual
situations which this court is not in the position to question. For instance the
learned trial judge found as a fact that there was no challenge to the evidence
of SAC1 Musa that the first appellant directed him to stop investigation on
the police report lodged by DSP Zull Adnam. It was also the finding of fact
of the learned trial judge that P5, the statutory declaration of Azizan, was not

altered. And it was also his finding of fact that Azizan did not tell DSP Zull
that it was due to money that he made the allegation. The foregoing factors
enhance the finding of the learned trial judge on the credibility and truthfulness
of Azizan which this court cannot and should not conveniently overturn. It is
trite law that an appellate court should be slow in interfering with any finding
of fact by a trial court. (See: Public Prosecutor v. Wan Razali Kassim [1970]
2 MLJ 79).
Press Statements
Learned counsel for the first appellant argued that from the press statements
made by the Prime Minister and the then Inspector General of police (D14,
D18, D41, D42) it was clear that there was no evidence found by the Special
Branch on the allegations against the first appellant. Obviously this submission
was raised to undermine the credibility of Azizan as a witness. However it
should be noted that these press statements were made in relation to the Travers
Police report No. 2706/97 lodged by ASP (now DSP) Zull Aznam in connection
with the leaflet entitled ‘Talqin kutuk Anwar Ibrahim’. Whereas the charges
preferred against the appellants arose from the Dang Wangi Report No 14140/
98 lodged by Mohamed Azmin bin Ali on 19 June 1998.
In his judgment the learned trial judge approached such issue in this way:

e

f

With all humility, I am of the view that these press statements have no
connection with the charges on which Dato’ Seri Anwar is being tried. They
are irrelevant. The charge against Dato’ Seri Anwar was brought about as a
result of a second investigation carried out by the police in respect of Dang
Wangi Report No 14140/ 98 lodged by Mohamed Azmin bin Ali on 19 June
1998. The court has to decide on the charge according to the evidence adduced
in court and nothing else. The press statements cannot be regarded as evidence
in this trial, as they are, as what I said, irrelevant.

g

It was also submitted by the learned public prosecutor that the contents of D41
should be regarded as hearsay evidence as it was based on the Special Branch
report which was not before the court.

h

With respect we are inclined to agree with the reasoning of the learned trial
judge. We are of the opinion that the result of an investigation in an earlier
police report does not necessarily negate any probable positive result in an
investigation based on a subsequent police report. Indeed as the learned trial
judge concluded that the earlier report would be irrelevant to the later report.
Hence overall we find no merit in this complaint and specifically in relation
to the credibility of Azizan.

Other Complaints On The Finding Of Credibility Of Azizan
It was the complaint of learned counsel for the first appellant that the learned
trial judge repetitively said that Azizan was a reliable witness thus indicating
that he was confused.
With respect we are unable to accept such submission. No doubt the learned
trial judge mentioned on several occasions in his grounds of judgment that he
found Azizan a reliable witness. However they were not without relevance. Each
reference was related to a point raised by the defence pertaining to the
credibility of Azizan. We therefore find the contention to be without merit as
well.

a

b

c

Next complaint was the allegation that the prosecution failed to call critical
witnesses that could have helped in determining the credibility of Azizan. And
that included the Special Branch report.
We have already dealt with this point in relation to s. 114(g) of EA 1950. At
any rate there was nothing to prevent the defence from calling those witnesses
who were considered by them to be crucial on the credibility of Azizan. There
was no reason for them to expect the prosecution to call each and every witness
available. (See: Teh Lee Tong v. PP [1956] MLJ 194).
In his summary on the testimony of Azizan vis-à-vis his credibility and
reliability as a witness of truth the learned trial judge came to his finding thus:
... it is my firm finding in relation to the charges against both accused that
he is a wholly reliable, credible and truthful witness taking into consideration
the whole of his evidence not withstanding inconsistencies, discrepancies and
contradictions which did not detract the weight and truth of his evidence in
relation to the ingredients of the charges against both accused.
Azizan has truthfully and without embellishment, distortion or exaggeration
in his evidence narrated in minute detail how he was sodomized by Dato’
Seri Anwar and Sukma at the date and place as stated in the charges against
both accused. Azizan in his evidence gave so much graphic detail of the
preliminaries, and a vivid description how both accused penetrated his anus
with their respective penises. His description and direct experience of being
sodomized completely negatives any probability that Azizan was tutored or
coached as claimed by the defence counsel. No reasonable person or judge
could on the evidence come to any other finding than the firm and unescapable
(sic) conclusion that both accused sodomized Azizan gaily whetting their
appetites at Tivoli Villa. Only persons directly and actively subjected to these
acts of sodomy would be able to narrate the details of the whole episode.
I am of the firm view that Azizan was speaking the whole truth when he
said in evidence that he was sodomized at Tivoli Villa between the months
of January and March 1993 by both accused as stated in the charge.

He has nothing to gain whatsoever but stood to lose everything if his evidence
was not true as this would affect his self respect and his good name and
standing in the eyes of the public and would also bring embarrassment to his
family members. Further one cannot conceive that one would fabricate a
serious charge of sodomy against the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime
Minister of Malaysia.
It cannot be denied that there are discrepancies in Azizan’s testimony. I have
considered these discrepancies earlier and had made my finding on them.
Apart from that, I do not find any serious discrepancies that would affect
Azizan’s credibility or reliability as a witness of truth on the ingredients of
the charges against both the accused.
… taking into account the credible manner in which he gave evidence, his
demeanour while giving evidence and his unchallenged and unshaken evidence
on the details of sodomy committed at Tivoli Villa which is consistent with
itself and the other evidence adduced by the prosecution, I have no hesitation
in coming to the conclusion and a finding that Azizan’s evidence is wholly
credible on all the facts relating to the act of sodomy committed on him by
both the accused.

f

The ultimate question to ask then is whether the learned trial judge was justified
in arriving at such finding. As shown in this judgment we have considered all
the complaints and contentions advanced for the appellants which were aimed
at impugning the findings of the court below in connection with the testimony
of Azizan, his credibility and reliability as a witness and for the reasons given
it is our conclusion that the learned trial judge was correct and justified to
come to his finding as he did in that ‘Azizan’s evidence is wholly credible on
all the facts relating to the act of sodomy committed on him by both the
accused’.

g

The Confession Of Second Appellant (‘P4’)
We now deal with another evidence relied upon by the learned trial judge. This
is the confession of the second appellant (P4). There are three issues to consider,
namely, its admissibility, its value as against the second appellant being the
maker and as against the first appellant being the co-accused.

e

h

i

The Admissibility Of P4
The admission of P4 by the learned trial judge was questioned by the learned
counsel for the appellants contending, inter alia, that it was not made
voluntarily and as a preliminary objection the issue of jurisdiction of the trial
court to conduct a trial within a trial was also raised.
On the jurisdiction issue it was the conclusion of the learned trial judge that
the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the admissibility of P4. It was his
view that the word ‘inquiry’ in s. 2 of CPC should not be confined to
preliminary inquiry as submitted by learned counsel for the appellants. Thus

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

475

he opined that ‘… Once the statement or confession is recorded by the
magistrate it can be used in any court if it is relevant and it becomes a duty
of the trial court or the court which hears the inquiry to determine the
admissibility of the statement or confession’.
We have considered the view of the learned trial judge and the argument of
the learned counsel for the appellants. We find no reason to interfere with the
conclusion of the court below.

a

b

On the issue of admissibility of P4 the objection remained, namely, that it was
not voluntarily given and that the recording was contrary to procedure.
Before admitting P4 the learned trial Judge conducted a trial-within-a-trial solely
to determine the issue of whether it was given voluntarily.
However the defence added other points in objecting to the admission of P4,
including the failure of the recording Magistrate to note down in P4 itself the
motive of the second appellant in making it. It was further contended that it
was wrong for the learned trial judge to accept the evidence of the recording
Magistrate given from the witness box as regards motive since that would be
contrary to ss. 91 and 92 of the EA 1950.
Before us the same arguments were put forward. In addition it was submitted,
inter alia, that before admitting P4 the learned trial judge should have made a
ruling whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that P4
was made voluntarily and that such admission should have been reviewed upon
the production of the letter (D28) written by the second appellant to the first
appellant. And it was also contended that it was wrong for the learned trial
judge to compel the second appellant to give his testimony during the trialwithin-trial. It was the submission of learned counsel for the second appellant
that there is a right to remain silent for a maker of a confession at the end of
the prosecution’s case in a trial-within-trial.
Now, it is settled law that ‘(N)o ‘statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement (Ibrahim v. R [1914] AC 599, 609 per Lord Sumner)] and
this test was accepted by the House of Lords as the correct approach in
Director of Public Prosecutions v. Ping Ling [1975] 3 All ER 175; [1976]
AC 574 in which the House said that is not necessary before a statement is
held to be inadmissible because it is not shown to have been voluntary, that it
should be thought or held that there was impropriety in the conduct of the
person to whom the statement was made, and that what has to be considered
is whether a statement is shown to have been voluntary rather than one brought
about in one of the ways referred to. It appears from the decision in Ping Lin
(ante) that the classic test of the admissibility of an accused’s confession that

the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was voluntary,
in the sense that it was not obtained from him either by fear or prejudice or
hope of advantage created by a person in authority, or by oppression, should
be applied in a manner which is part objective, part subjective … It is open
to an appellate court to interfere with the finding on a question of fact as to
the voluntariness of a confession if the impugned finding has been reached
without applying the true and relevant legal tests and consideration of relevant
matters (Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab AIR [1957] SC 637, 643; Public
Prosecutor v. Thum Soo Chye [1954] MLS 96, 99).’ per Abdoolcader FJ in
Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim v. Public Prosecutor [1983] 2 MLJ 232 at p. 272.
(emphasis added).
And it is also the law that the ‘question of admissibility of evidence is for the
judge and not the jury to decide. ... Where this calls for a decision as to
whether the statement is free and voluntary a question of fact is involved and
that question must be decided, like any other question of fact, on evidence.
And to decide it the judge must listen not only to any evidence tendered by
the prosecution but also to any evidence relating to the issue tendered by the
defence, including if tendered the evidence of the prisoner.’ per Thomson LP
at p. 68 in Yaacob v. PP [1966] 1 MLJ 67. (emphasis added).
Accordingly and keeping the principles of law in the forefront of our minds
we have given serious consideration to the various points raised and have
carefully perused the manner in which the learned trial judge dealt with them
and overall we have no reason to interfere with his findings. He was in the
position of seeing and hearing the witnesses called and made certain findings
of facts. Such findings an appellate court should be slow to interfere. In Chan
Teng Cheong v Public Prosecutor [1967] 1 MLJ 217 his Lordship Azmi CJ
(Malaya) (as he then was) said this at p. 219:
In our view this is a question of fact and of credibility. The learned judge
had seen these two witnesses who gave their evidence, and he had in his
finding on this point, found there was no such inducement. We see no reason
why this court should interfere with that finding of fact made by the learned
judge.

In respect of the other contentions described as errors on the part of the learned
trial judge, we do not think there are any merits in them. And that perhaps
explains for the lack of any good authority submitted to us. In our view once
the learned trial judge ruled that P4 was given voluntarily that should meet
the requirement. There is no legal necessity for him to expressly state that the
standard of beyond reasonable doubt had been met in order for the admission
to be good in law. It is implied from the finding.

i

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

477

On the allegation of compulsion for the second appellant to give his evidence,
we find no merit in it. In the Record of Appeal it is clear that what the learned
trial judge said was that the second appellant was to give his evidence if he
so desired.
As for D28 the point was already well considered by the learned trial judge
and he made his findings. We have no reason to differ. Indeed D28 was not
produced during the trial-within-trial and there was no good reason for the
failure. Further, we agree with the learned trial judge that the contents of D28
are mere repetition of what were said by the second appellant during the trialwithin-trial.
Hence, we hold that P4 was properly admitted in evidence by the learned trial
judge in the exercise of his discretion. As an appellate court we are not
convinced that the decision by the learned trial judge to admit P4 was ‘reached
without applying the true and relevant legal tests and consideration of relevant
matters’. Accordingly we find that there is no basis for the grievance of the
appellants on the issue admissibility of P4.
P4 As Against The Second Appellant
For a confession to be of any use it is also necessary for it to be true and
trustworthy. However a trial court is also entitled to accept part of it and reject
the rest. (See: Lim Yow Choon v. Public Prosecutor [1972] 1 MLJ 205).
Now, a confession of a maker having been duly admitted in evidence is
sufficient to convict him if the court is satisfied that it is true and trustworthy.
And even if the maker were to retract it subsequently it can still be used to
convict him so long as the court is satisfied of its truth. This is settled law.
The then Federal Court in Osman & Anor v. Public Prosecutor [1967] 1 MLJ
137 while disagreeing with the Indian cases cited, adopted the pronouncement
of the principle in Yap Sow Keong v. Public Prosecutor [1947] MLJ 90 that
stated as follows:
In our view the law as to the admissibility of retracted confessions in evidence
is clear, and put shortly it is that an accused person can be convicted on his
own confession, even when it is retracted, if the Court is satisfied of its truth.
We do not agree with those Indian decisions which lay down that before a
person can be convicted on his retracted confession there must be corroborative
evidence to support it.

It is interesting to note that in Osman & Anor v. Public Prosecutor (supra)
the Privy Council did not expressly disagree with the view of the then Federal
Court on the issue. (See also: Tinit & Ors v. Public Prosecutor (No. 2) (supra);
Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim v. Public Prosecutor (supra)).

There are of course views expressed that although in principle it is possible
for an accused person to be convicted on his confession standing alone provided
the court is of the opinion that the incriminating parts thereof are true, in
practice the court always looks for corroboration. (See: Public Prosecutor v.
Chong Boo See [1988] 1 CLJ 679; [1988] 2 CLJ (Rep) 206, Public Prosecutor
v. Lai Pong Yuen & Ors. [1968] 1 MLJ 12). With respect these cases made
no reference to the earlier decisions of the higher courts.
On our part we find no justification to depart from those earlier decisions of
high authority which in any event are binding on this court. At any rate the
caveat stipulated in those contrary views indicates that such additional
requirement is only a matter of practice and prudence. Common sense of course
dictates that where corroborative evidence is found it should not be ignored.

d

Before us it was also the contention of learned counsel for the second appellant
that P4 should not be relied upon to find the guilt of his client simply because
it was not given voluntarily.

e

In view of our agreement with the finding of the learned trial judge on the
admissibility of P4 we do not think such submission can prevail. In any event
we have examined the careful and thorough approach undertaken by the learned
trial judge before coming to his conclusion and we are inclined to agree with
him.

f

It was also submitted that P4 ought not to be relied upon as it did not contain
the truth, for instance, the statement therein pertaining to the residence of the
first appellant during the period referred to which was incorrect and that the
medical report on the second appellant indicated that he was not sodomized.

g

h

i

We note that the learned trial judge was careful in his analysis of the facts
and circumstances before coming to his conclusion as to the truth of the
statements in P4. We would also say that any discrepancies should be taken
as indicators that no force, inducement or threat was used when P4 was given.
And we agree with learned trial judge’s findings that the details in P4 are
indicative of the fact that what were said by second appellant could not have
been couched or of recent origin. (See: Juraimi bin Hussin v. Public Prosecutor
[1998] 2 CLJ 383; Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim v. Public Prosecutor (supra). On
our part having perused the contents of P4 and the evidence adduced as a whole
we are convinced that it contains the truth particularly pertaining to the incident
as per charges. Indeed the sequence given by the second appellant in P4 when
the offences were committed tallies with the version of Azizan. For instance
both Azizan and the second appellant said that the first appellant was in the
toilet after having sodomized Azizan. If that is not the truth then it would have
been too much of a coincidence for both Azizan and the second appellant to

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

479

make such reference. Such minute detail could not have come easily if there
was no truth in what both were saying and there was no assertion that the
two colluded when making their respective statements or that the prosecution
gave Azizan such information. Anyway collusion could not have been possible
since there were also differences in the statements of the two persons in term
of other details. Those would have been avoided if indeed Azizan was duly
informed of what the second appellant had said in P4. One such difference is
that in P4 the second appellant said that he did not ejaculate while Azizan
said otherwise. We would therefore say that P4 corroborated the testimony of
Azizan.

a

In P4, the second appellant admitted to have had previous homosexual
relationships. However, the second appellant in his defence make no specific
denial of the above mentioned statement. Further, there is also the evidence of
PW2 – Dr. Mohd. Fadzil bin Man to consider who in his evidence, under crossexamination, stated that he had the notes made by him in regard to the Second
appellant. Hence we are in agreement with the learned trial judge in his view
on the importance of the evidence of PW2 when he said:

c

The importance of the evidence of this witness cannot be overlooked and it
is this, it establishes the fact that Sukma was involved in homosexual activities
with his adopted brother (adik angkat) and his business partner ... What
Sukma told this witness that he was involved in homosexual activities is a
confession as defined under s. 17 of the Evidence Act 1950 and its
voluntariness is not disputed. This evidence is admissible to establish the fact
that Sukma is a homosexual and is relevant to the issue of sodomy which is
the subject matter of the charges against him.

b

d

e

And save for his bare denial on the truth of the material parts of P4, the second
appellant adduced no further evidence to support his assertion that the contents
were orchestrated by the police. With respect we do not think such stand
assisted his case in anyway.

f

As regards the medical reports on the second appellant the learned trial Judge
found that their nett effect was neutral, hence he did not accept them. Having
perused the evidence of the doctors called and from their reports we are inclined
to agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge.

g

We are therefore of the view that the learned trial judge was correct in his
appreciation of the value and weight to be attached to P4 and the resultant
conclusion arising there-from in respect of proof against the second appellant.
Thus we find no merit in the complaint of the second appellant on this issue.

P4 In Relation To The First Appellant
In his approach on this issue the learned trial judge first came to a conclusion
that he required no aid from P4 in dealing with the charge against the first
appellant. He said that the evidence of Azizan was sufficient for that purpose.
Alternatively, he was inclined to follow the interpretation of s. 30 of the EA
1950 by the Singapore Court starting with the case of Chin Seow Noi & Ors
v. Public Prosecutor [1994] 1 SLR 135. And the learned trial judge came to
the finding thus:
As a result I conclude that a confession by an accused is capable of standing
on its own and be used against a co-accused to support a conviction provided
the evidence emanating from the confession satisfies the court beyond
reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. The confession of Sukma can therefore
be used standing on its own against Dato’ Seri Anwar.

The alternative approach undertaken by the learned trial judge was severely
attacked by learned counsel for the appellants submitting that in so doing the
principle of binding precedent was infringed. Learned counsel of course was
referring to the earlier decisions of the then apex court of this country. In
Herchun Singh & Ors v. Public Prosecutor (supra) his Lordship HT Ong CJ
(Malaya) at p. 210 said:
In our judgment, however, the proper interpretation of section 30 is that of
Bose J. in Kashmira Singh, as follows:
The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first to marshall
the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether
from consideration and see whether ‘if it is believed’, a conviction could
safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the
confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in
aid. But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the
other evidence as it stands even though, ‘if believed’, it would be
sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the judge may call
in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence
and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the
confession he would not be prepared to accept.

And in Yap Chai Chai & Anor v. Public Prosecutor (supra) at p. 222 the
principle was reiterated in these words:
h

i

On behalf of the first appellant, it was further argued that the second
appellant’s confessional statement should not have been used or considered
as evidence, against the first appellant, of common intention. We rejected this
contention: the question having been concluded by authority, being a decision
of this court in Herchun Singh & Ors v. Public Prosecutor [1969] 2 MLJ
209, 211 on the proper interpretation and application of section 30 of the
Evidence Ordinance 1950 (now the Evidence Act No. 56) which reads:

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

481

30.(1) When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same
offence, and a confession made by one of those persons affecting himself
and some other of those persons is proved, the court may take into
consideration the confession as against the other person as well as
against the person who makes the confession.

a

The statement of principle therein enunciated was that the learned trial judge
was right in taking the confession of one accused into consideration against
the other to lend assurance to the other evidence against them in believing
the accused to be guilty.

b

His Lordship Hashim Yeop Sani J (as he then was) in Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim
v. Public Prosecutor (supra) expressed his view on the rationale of the principle
when he said this at p. 268:
Stated simply the principle is as follows. It would be proper for the trial judge
to take the confession of one accused into consideration against the other
accused to lend assurance to other evidence the other co-accused. ... As to
why the law is strict on the application of a confession of an accused person
as against a co-accused is not difficult to appreciate because it is based on a
very sound principle. Since a confession is neither required to be given on
oath nor to be made in the presence of the other co-accused whom it
implicates it is therefore not wrong to describe it as a very weak type of
evidence which should not be allowed to form the basis or foundation of a
conviction but should only be used in support of other positive evidence. This,
in my opinion, is the intention of section 30 of the Evidence Act when it
used the words “may take into consideration.

And in Public Prosecutor v. Nordin bin Johan & Anor [1983] 2 CLJ 22;
[1983] CLJ (Rep) 345 his Lordship Raja Azlan Shah LP (as his Majesty then
was) also gave his instructive view on s. 30 in this fashion:
Section 30 provides that this statement may be taken into consideration against
the two respondents but on the decided authorities the pre-requisite to this is
that there must be some cogent evidence against them quite apart from the
statement of the third accused. The nature of this evidence which would be
extraneous to the confession of a co-accused and its qualitative and probative
value in relation to the charge must ex necessitate rei be a factual matter in
the context and circumstances of the particular case.

It is therefore obvious that the learned trial judge in the present case had
departed from the earlier decisions of the highest court in this country preferring
to follow the interpretation and reasoning of the Singapore Court of Appeal.
Unfortunately the learned trial judge missed the point. In Chin Seow Noi &
Ors (supra) the learned judge there did not follow Herchun Singh & Ors
(supra) as he took the view that it was not binding on Singapore courts being

a decision of the then Malaysian Federal Court rendered after Singapore became
an independent nation. In addition it was observed that the Indian cases on
the interpretation of s. 30 should not be applicable in view of the crucial
differences between the Indian Evidence Act 1872 and the Singapore Evidence
Act including the definition of ‘evidence’ therein. In short the Singapore Court
of Appeal declined to adopt the ‘narrow construction’ propounded in the leading
cases of Bhuboni Sahu v. R [1949] AIR PC 257 and Kashmira Singh v. State
of Madhya Pradesh AIR [1952] SC 159 which were followed in Herchun Singh
& Ors (supra).
With respect we are of the view that it was incorrect for the learned trial judge
in the present case to depart from the obvious binding effect of the decisions
in Herchun Singh & Ors (supra) and Yap Chai Chai & Anor (supra). As for
his reference to the case of Noliana bte Sulaiman v. Public Prosecutor [2001]
1 CLJ 36 we do not think the learned judge there went as far as saying ‘that
a confession by an accused is capable of standing on its own and be used
against a co-accused to support a conviction provided the evidence emanating
from the confession satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s
guilt’. But if there was an impression given to that effect then we say that
that would be erroneous in law and not reflective of the current law of this
country. As to the need for the lower courts to observe the principle of stare
decisis, we need only to refer to Dalip Bhagwan Singh v. Public Prosecutor
[1997] 4 CLJ 645 in which the Federal Court reminded the lower tiers in these
words:
The doctrine of stare decisis or the rule of judicial precedent dictates that a
court other than the highest court is obliged generally to follow the decisions
of the courts at a higher or the same level in the court structure subject to
certain exceptions affecting especially the Court of Appeal.

h

Now, the question to ask is whether such misdirection should inevitably lead
to the reversal of the finding of guilt of the first appellant or whether as an
appellate court we can reevaluate P4 as against the first appellant bearing in
mind the principle enunciated in Herchun Singh & Ors (supra) and Yap Chai
Chai & Anor (supra). It is to be noted that the guilt of the first appellant as
found by the learned trial judge was not entirely based on P4. In fact he made
it plainly clear that he was prepared to find the guilt of the first appellant
solely on the testimony of Azizan whom he found to be a credible witness of
truth. He said this:

i

Apart from the confession there is the evidence of Azizan who testified that
he was sodomized by Dato’ Seri Anwar at Sukma’s apartment at Tivoli Villa
at about 7.30 pm between January and March 1993 as stated in the charge
against him. This evidence was not successfully challenged by the defence,
though an attempt was made to challenge it. I accepted his evidence for the

g

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

483

reasons which I had stated when I dealt with the issue of Azizan’s credibility
in the earlier part of this judgment and made a ruling that Azizan is a reliable
and truthful witness. His evidence is wholly reliable and capable of belief,
which I accept. It is indeed a very strong piece of independent evidence to
prove that Dato’ Seri Anwar committed sodomy on Azizan as stated in the
charge against him. I am prepared to act on this evidence alone independently,
disregarding and ignoring the confession on the principle as laid down in
Herchun Singh’s case. It is therefore not necessary for me to call the
confession in aid.

a

b

We have given this issue our anxious consideration and we are of the view
that we can re-evaluate the value of P4 in relation to the first appellant on
the same rationale that we are entitled to review the admissibility and weight
to be given to a confession.

c

As indicated earlier, in his grounds of judgment the learned trial judge held
that even without P4 he was prepared to act on the evidence of Azizan
independently to prove that the first appellant ‘committed sodomy on Azizan
as stated in the charge against him’. The question is: was he right in making
such a finding?

d

We have already expressed our view on the criticism levelled against the
evidence of Azizan and our concurrence with the finding the learned trial judge.
Hence we are of the view that the learned trial judge was right in coming to
such a finding.

e

Next, should P4 be taken into ‘consideration against the other (the first
appellant) to lend assurance to the other evidence against them in believing the
accused (first appellant) to be guilty’? We find no reason why it should not
be done. And as we have given our view on the standing of P4 in terms of
its admissibility and its truth cum trustworthiness, it does therefore lend
assurance to the other evidence, specifically to the testimony of Azizan, in
believing the guilt of the first appellant.
We are also of the view that the testimony of PW2 is quite relevant in this
respect. The learned trial judge found that what the second appellant told PW2
amounted to a confession under s. 17 of the EA 1950. And in his statement
to PW2 the second appellant told him that he had been having homosexual
relationship with his adopted brother. The second appellant denied making such
disclosure to PW2. However in the face of the notes taken by PW2 so soon
after examining the second appellant and with only a bare denial being offered
to counter the evidence of PW2 we are inclined to agree with the finding of
the learned trial judge that the evidence of PW2 ‘establishes the fact that Sukma
was involved in homosexual activities with his adopted brother’. And who was
the adopted brother referred to? There was no suggestion that the second

appellant had another adopted brother besides the first appellant. Further the
first appellant never denied that the second appellant was his adopted brother.
Bearing in mind the above mentioned facts alluded to by the second appellant
and viewing the evidence on this aspect in totality we are of the view that the
learned trial judge did not err in his conclusion that the adopted brother referred
to therein was none other than the first appellant. No doubt the testimony of
PW2 is not directly on the allegation as per charge. But it does have strong
bearing on some of the material statements in P4 particularly on the history
of sexual relationship of the second appellant and the first appellant thereby
removing or diluting any suggestion that P4 is inherently incredible in contents.
In summary, though we agree with the submission of learned counsel for the
appellants on the application of s. 30 of the EA 1950 we do not think such
misdirection by the learned trial judge should nullify the whole of the convictions
of the appellants. And as we have done, we find P4 does lend assurance to
the other evidence on the guilt of the first appellant in that ‘cogent evidence’
existed against him ‘quite apart from the statement’ of the second appellant.
The Defences Proffered By The First Appellant

e

f

g

(a) Defence Of Alibi
In view of what we have said earlier on, namely, that the first appellant never
served a notice of alibi or applied for an adjournment to serve one in connection
with the amended charge, any admission of evidence pertaining to a defence
of alibi would be contrary to the established legal principle. As such there is
no basis for the first appellant to complain that he has been deprived of his
constitutional right to a fair trial. He chose not to raise such defence or failed
to comply with the relevant statutory provision. No blame should therefore be
imposed upon anyone else. Accordingly we do not think the invocation of the
proviso to s. 60(1) of the CJA should be ruled out.
It was obliquely submitted that it was a joint trial, hence the application by
the second appellant would suffice. With respect the contention missed a point
in that at the commencement of the trial such a stand was not taken. There
was just no application by the first appellant for an adjournment and he did
not even associate himself with the application by the second appellant. As for
the refusal by the learned trial judge to grant an adjournment to the second
appellant reason was given and we will deal with that shortly.

h

i

In the event that we are wrong in our view above in respect of the first
appellant, then arising from what had transpired before the learned trial judge,
the first appellant could not complain that his trial was conducted unfairly thus
nullifying the trial as a whole. If at all it was to his advantage in that despite
the absence of the required notice the learned trial judge proceeded to hear the
alibi evidence tendered. That was of course possible as the public prosecutor

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

485

did not object to such evidence being adduced. Further, if indeed the first
appellant or his team of learned counsel seriously believed that it was absolutely
wrong in law thus nullifying the trial, for the learned trial judge to accept such
evidence in the absence of a notice, there was no explanation given for doing
what they did, in that they proceeded to adduce alibi evidence.
Witnesses were called to show that the first appellant could not have had the
opportunity to commit the offence as he was elsewhere. Attempts were made
to account for the days the first appellant was in the country. Being the then
Deputy Prime Minister his movements were recorded. Diaries were referred to
and allegation made that they had been seized by the police during the
investigation of the case. And that appears to be true with the existence of
IDD11 dated 5 September 1998 – the search list which we note was never
formally tendered and marked as an exhibit. Anyway for all its worth the list
does not show that the 1993 diary was seized. That would have been a crucial
piece of evidence on the defence of alibi. Thus, it remains a pure assertion by
the defence that the 1993 diary was taken by the police. During the hearing
of these appeals the learned public prosecutor informed the court that all the
records in their possession were given to the defence.

a

b

c

d

Be that as it may the learned trial judge made the following findings:
(a) that for the period from 4 February to 31 March 1993 the whereabouts
of the first appellant were proved by the witnesses called;

e

(b) that 15 February 1993 was excluded on account of the evidence of Azizan
that he was working the day before the incident;
(c) that 19 February 1993 should not be excluded even though it was a Friday
as Azizan could have prayed his Zohor prayer in the office. Objection was
taken on this finding due to prior observation by the learned trial judge in
respect of Friday prayer. However nothing serious turned on this as finally
the learned trial judge was only interested in the period from January 1993
to 3rd February 1993;

f

g

(d) that the prosecution did not challenge the alibi for the period from 4
February 1993 to 31 March 1993, hence deemed accepted;
(e) that the period between the whole of January 1993 and 3 February 1993
remained unaccounted for and no evidence was adduced by the first
appellant on his movements during that period; and

h

(f) ‘the defence of alibi fails to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt or in
the truth of the prosecution case’.

Before us learned counsel for the first appellant submitted that the proceeding
on the defence of alibi was a nullity or that the finding arrived at by the learned
trial judge was contrary to established legal principle on burden of proof for
the following reasons, inter alia:
(a) that the learned trial judge erred in placing a heavier burden of proof on
the defence by expecting a proof of beyond reasonable doubt. And this
could be discerned from the use of the word ‘conclusive’;
(b) that there was no rebuttal evidence adduced by the prosecution on the
evidence tendered by the defence;

c

(c) that between January 1993 and 3 February 1993 there was extensive work
carried out in the apartment of the second appellant thus no necessity for
alibi;
(d) that the learned trial judge doubted on the receipt tendered by the defence
although there was no rebuttal evidence from the prosecution; and

d

e

f

g

h

i

(e) that it was the evidence of the second appellant that he only entered the
apartment in April 1993 yet the learned trial judge refused to accept such
assertion when there was no rebuttal evidence adduced by the prosecution.
With respect we are unable to agree with the submission that the findings of
the learned trial judge on the evidence of alibi of the first appellant were flawed.
Some of those findings are findings of facts in which this court should be slow
to interfere. On the use of the word ‘conclusive’ by the learned trial judge in
the course of his analysis of the evidence we do not think he intended it to
mean that it should be automatically equated at all times to the phrase ‘beyond
reasonable doubt’ as ordinarily understood in evidential term. It has to be taken
in the context of its usage. For instance, when the learned trial judge in his
grounds of judgment used the phrase ‘his evidence when he said there was no
bed in the apartment cannot be accepted as conclusive that there was no bed
or mattresses in the other rooms’ it could not be understood to mean that the
learned trial judge expected the witness to prove the issue ‘beyond reasonable
doubt’ as required of the prosecution. All it means is that such evidence on
its own is not sufficient as proof of the fact asserted and that more is needed
before it can be said that such fact is proved to the standard required of the
party asserting it. And in the context of the foregoing phrase it should be
understood to mean the standard of proof expected of the defence which is
‘on the balance of probabilities’. We are fortified in our view with the correct
reference by the learned trial judge of the relevant law.
Now, from the evidence tendered we do not think the learned trial judge should
be faulted when he came to the conclusion that for the period from January
1993 to 3 February 1993 the first appellant failed to account for his movements
or where abouts. The only explanation given by the first appellant was that

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

487

during that period the apartment was being extensively renovated. The learned
trial judge considered the evidence adduced on that issue and made his finding.
We will deal with this point in greater detail later on in this judgment.
Incidentally, in view of the period which the learned trial judge was looking
at and which we have no doubt to be correct, the dispute on the relevance of
19 February 1993 was no longer of concern.

a

b

Accordingly we are inclined to agree with the conclusion of the learned trial
Judge that for the period from the whole of January 1993 to 3 February 1993
nothing was shown on the movement of the first appellant.
Appellants At Tivoli Villa?
The alleged renovation of the apartment at Tivoli Villa became the common
ground for the appellants in relation to their respective defence of alibi. In
passing we do not think such evidence can strictly be construed as alibi evidence
as ordinarily understood.

c

Several witnesses, (Encik Rahimazlan (DW4), Encik Tan Seng Khoon (DW9)
and Encik Chee Too Nam @ Chin Too Nam (DW8)) were called aimed at
showing that indeed for the period from January 1993 to 3 February 1993 the
apartment was under extensive renovation. It was also produced a letter from
Bandar Raya Developments Bhd. (exh. D36). Even the purchase of a bed
became an issue. The learned trial judge went on to consider each and every
one of the evidence adduced and came to his findings, inter alia:

d

e

(i) that in the face of the evidence of Azizan and P4 the denial by the first
appellant to be at the apartment as alleged in the charge must be rejected;
(ii) that ‘from the evidence of DW4 and DW9 the technical supervisor of
Bandar Raya Developments Bhd at the material time it was established
that there was a major renovation of the bathroom to the master bedroom
only’;

f

(iii) that the second appellant had unrestricted and free access to the apartment;
(iv) that the receipt (D35) purportedly issued on the purchase of the beds and
divans appeared to be new and nothing shown who issued it;

g

(iv) that the testimony of DW4, being an interested witness should be treated
‘with suspicion and caution’;
(v) that the evidence of DW9 ‘when he said there was no bed in the apartment
cannot be accepted as conclusive that there was no bed or mattresses in
the other rooms’ since ‘he only noticed the renovation works in the master
bathroom’; and
(vi) that the evidence of Azizan was preferred to that of DW4 and DW9.

Before us learned counsel for the appellants complained that the learned trial
judge committed errors in assessing the evidence adduced on alibi. The basic
complaints are as follows, inter alia,:
(a) that it was unchallenged the evidence of the second appellant that there
was no bed in the apartment before 12 February 1993;

b

(b) that the evidence of DW4 was not rejected but only treated with suspicion;
and
(c) that the learned trial judge did not assess the evidence of Azizan with the
other evidence available.

c

d

e

f

g

h

i

Overall from our reading of the evidence adduced in relation to the apartment
at Tivoli Villa we are unable to agree with the contention that the findings of
the learned trial judge were made without any consideration of the other
evidence adduced. He did assess the evidence of the second appellant and the
other witnesses called as to the availability of the apartment on the one hand
and the evidence of Azizan’s and P4 on the other and came to his conclusion
that he preferred the evidence of Azizan. That of course was his assessment
of witnesses which as an appellate court we should be slow to interfere. And
we have no reason to say that the conclusion of the learned trial judge as to
his preferred version is entirely erroneous on the evidence adduced. For instance,
on the access to the apartment it was in fact the evidence of the second
appellant that he took the keys in December 1992. Further, it is also quite
clear from the evidence of DW9 that he confined his inspection to certain parts
of the apartment, specifically the master bedroom and the bathroom. Indeed
we are inclined to agree with the submission of the learned public prosecutor
that there was no reference at all to the third room in the apartment that did
not have a bathroom attached. We note that it was during the cross-examination
of Azizan that the details on the apartment came to light and the defence did
not counter those descriptions. It might have been a different situation if Azizan
had given a description of a room with bathroom attached. In fact this is
another piece of the evidence of Azizan that would have swayed any trier of
facts that he was indeed relating a real incident and not borne out of
imagination or motive.
Incidentally, learned counsel for the second appellant strenuously submitted that
evidence were available but were not considered by the learned trial judge such
as the receipts and building plans on the renovation works. But hardly any of
these alleged documents were tendered as exhibits. And one document that was
relied upon quite heavily was IDD 37A. But that document was not admitted
as an exhibit. It came into the picture purely for identification purpose. As
such we are inclined to agree with the learned trial judge that it should be
excluded as part of the trial record.

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

489

The doubt cast upon the testimony of DW4 by the learned trial judge was not
without reason. This witness was vague, if not, evasive, on the period taken
for the completion of the renovation works. Further, he failed to explain the
contents of D35 in that therein showed two mattresses and three divans. Hence
it was not without basis for the learned public prosecutor to submit that the
third divan must have been for the third room which had no bathroom attached
but already had a bed and mattress at the material time.
As to the observation of the learned trial judge on D35 as being new we say
that he is entitled to make it but we do not think such observation should be
a basis for the rejection of its evidential value. On our part we pause to note
that D35 itself may not be the best proof on the purchase of those mattresses
and divans. Other than the evidence of the shop that claimed to have sold them
there was nothing to link it to those items. It would not have been simple as
mattresses do not have serial or model numbers identification.

a

b

c

On the assertion that there was a failure on the part of the prosecution to crossexamine the second appellant pertaining to the bed, with respect we are inclined
to agree with the contention of the learned public prosecutor that it was not
fatal and necessary since it was already in the evidence of Azizan adduced
during his cross-examination that the act was committed on a queen-sized bed.
It should also be noted that it was the defence that wanted the learned trial
judge to accept the fact that the defence of alibi prevailed. Hence it should
therefore be for the defence to establish it so as to cast reasonable doubt on
the prosecution’s case and not for the prosecution to disprove once a mere
assertion has been made. Section 103 of the EA 1950 is relevant.

d

Accordingly we find no reason to interfere with the conclusion of the learned
trial judge that in respect of the first appellant his denial of being in the second
appellant’s apartment at Tivoli Villa as alleged in the charge should be rejected
‘in the face of overwhelming and convincing evidence of Azizan’. As noted
earlier for the period between January 1993 and 3 February 1993 no evidence
as to his whereabouts was tendered for the first appellant. The defence was
contented to rely on the assertion that during that period the apartment at the
Tivoli Villa was under extensive renovation. But the finding of the learned trial
judge had stated otherwise and which we have no reason to differ. Thus we
accept as the correct position that for the period from January 1993 to 3rd
February 1993 the first appellant failed to establish his whereabouts so as to
cast a reasonable doubt to the prosecution’s case that he was there. We will
deal with the position of the alibi defence and the nature of the evidence
tendered for that purpose by the second appellant later on in this judgment.

(b) The defence of fabrication and conspiracy
The issue of fabrication as alleged by the defence is partly connected to the
allegation of bad faith in the prosecution of the first appellant. And we have
already dealt with this issue hereinabove. But the allegation of fabrication by
the defence went further to include an existence of conspiracy to fabricate
evidence by a group of persons with vested interest to ensure the downfall of
the first appellant. Witnesses were called for that purpose.
In his grounds of judgment the learned trial judge concluded that from the
evidence adduced he was not satisfied that such defence had been substantiated.

c

d

Before us learned counsel for the first appellant submitted that the learned trial
judge erred in his conclusion in that, inter alia:
(i)

he considered the evidence adduced in isolation and glossed over them
instead of adopting a holistic approach with the result that the first
appellant received an unfair trial;

(ii)

that the learned trial judge was already prejudiced when he said that the
issue of fabrication was irrelevant;

(iii)

that adverse inference should have been made for the failure by the
prosecution to call those mentioned by the witnesses called by the defence
in connection with the defence of fabrication and conspiracy instead of
merely offering them to the defence;

(iv)

that the learned trial judge was too eager to rule as being hearsay,
irrelevant or given with motives the testimonies of the witnesses called
by the defence;

(v)

that the learned trial judge should have taken judicial notice of the Special
Branch report that was sent to the Prime Minister in connection with
the allegation of sexual misconduct of the first appellant;

(vi)

that the statutory declaration of one Umi Halfida (D37) should have been
read by the learned trial judge in the light of the other evidence adduced
instead of summarily dismissing it;

e

f

g

(vii) that the evidence of the first appellant should have been considered as it
detailed the reasons for those involved in the conspiracy to act as they
did;
h

(viii) that the learned trial judge did not give any latitude to the discrepancies
in the testimonies of the witnesses called by the defence while he gave
so much to the witnesses called by the prosecution; and
(ix)

i

that the learned trial judge should have given the benefit of doubt to the
defence where it was due but failed to do so contrary to established legal
principles.

In reply the learned public prosecutor submitted, inter alia:

a

(a) that before any evidence can be admitted it should be relevant to the issue
at hand. Sections 11 and 15 of the EA 1950 were referred;
(b) that the learned trial judge was justified in either ruling the evidence of
the witnesses called by the defence as hearsay or unbelievable due to the
nature of the evidence and its quality; and

b

(c) that there were glaring contradictions in the evidence of some the witnesses
called by the defence.
Now, further to what we have stated earlier on we note that the charge against
the first appellant is for sodomizing Azizan. Yet no where in the testimony
and the statutory declaration of DW31 was it ever revealed that it was for
that offence that the two learned Deputies Public Prosecutor were referring to
when they were alleged to have asked him to get his client to fabricate evidence.
Indeed the impression that was given by DW31 was that short of fabricating
evidence his client had nothing at all to say.

c

d

However, it was not disputed that the client of DW31 gave his police statement
subsequently. Again nowhere it was alleged by DW31 that the contents of such
statement were fabricated or they were remotely connected to the nature of the
offence for which the first appellant was charged.

e

We are therefore inclined to agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge
and as submitted by the learned public prosecutor before us that such matters
alleged and the statutory declaration of DW31 were irrelevant to the issue at
hand. Accordingly we find no merit in the complaint of the first appellant in
relation to this issue.

f

It was also the complaint of learned counsel for the first appellant that the
learned trial judge failed to mention, let alone consider the affidavits of Dr.
Munawar Ahmad Anees (D53) and Dato’ Nallakaruppan (D54).
With respect the learned trial judge did consider them and came to his finding
that they were irrelevant as they did not make any reference to what was being
alleged in the charge preferred against the first appellant. At any rate we would
say that such affidavits provided little or no evidential value at all when
compared to the gravity of the allegation hurled against the two learned deputies
who are also officers of the court. It would be a tragedy if such allegation
could be lightly established by a mere affidavit, shielded from any crossexamination by the affected party.

As regards the other witnesses including the first appellant called by the defence
purportedly to show the existence of a conspiracy to fabricate evidence against
the first appellant, we note that the learned trial judge analyzed their testimonies
carefully and gave his reasons for being unable to accept their evidence as
credible. Such assessments and findings should be given due respect and weight
unless they are so incredible that no reasonable trier of facts or tribunal would
have made them. (See: Herchun Singh & Ors v. Public Prosecutor (supra);
Lai Kim Hon & Ors v. Public Prosecutor (supra)). We heard no assertion
that such was the case here. The closest to that was the submission by learned
counsel for the first appellant that the learned trial judge was not being fair in
that he was lenient in his reception to the evidence of the witnesses for the
prosecution while the slightest mistake as to the date made by DW15-DSP Zull
Aznam resulted in the rejection of his evidence.
With respect we are unable to agree with the contention of learned counsel
for the first appellant that the learned trial judge was not being fair in the
disposal of the evidence of the witnesses called by the defence. As to the
testimony of DW15 we note that the learned trial judge examined his evidence
in detail and gave his reasons one of which was the discrepancy in the date
before refusing to believe him. We find nothing wrong in that exercise.
We are also unable to find any gross error in the finding of the learned trial
judge when he refused to believe the allegations and assertions of DW6 – Raja
Kamaruddin bin Raja Abdul Wahid and DW19 – Jamal Abdur Rahman. For
instance DW6 in his evidence not only contradicted himself but also made his
version so inherently improbable for a reasonable tribunal to accept. At one
point he said that he was told by none other than one Dato’ Aziz Shamsuddin
himself that he was about to fabricate evidence of sexual misconduct against
the first appellant. Yet when he confronted the first appellant he posed a
question to him, that is, whether it was true that he was involved in sexual
misconduct, instead of telling him what he was told. Common sense dictates
that DW6, who must have been intelligent enough to be taken by the said Dato’
Aziz in confidence, could not have made such move if there was any truth in
what he alleged. And the reported reaction of the first appellant when asked
indicated the improbability, unless of course the first appellant did not want
to rebut the allegation, of the tale promoted by DW6. Any sensible person,
more so in the position of the first appellant at that time, would have
immediately alerted the authorities of what was going on. There was no
explanation for not asking DW6 to lodge a police report immediately or soon
after. DW6 said that he did not trust the police. But surely the first appellant
could not be heard to say at that time that he too did not have any confidence
in the police force.

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

493

In all we are in agreement with the finding of the learned trial judge that none
of the witnesses called by the defence ever came near to saying that evidence
was being fabricated to implicate the first appellant of having sodomized Azizan.
And if indeed there was a ‘mastermind’ in the fabrication of evidence directed
against the first appellant for the offence he was ultimately charged, there was
no reason for the ‘shortcomings’ in the evidence as alleged by learned counsel
for the appellants. Any sensible person preparing a venture to frame another
of an offence would have ensured that the key issues were in place to prevent
any failure.
Accordingly we have no reason to interfere with the conclusion of the learned
trial judge in respect of the defence of conspiracy and fabrication raised by
the first appellant.
The Defence Of The Second Appellant – Alibi
Apart from the common grievances raised particularly on the technical issues,
the main defence of the second appellant was one of alibi. However in the
course of his submissions learned counsel for the second appellant conceded
that his client did not adduce evidence of alibi. Nevertheless that concession
would be of limited effect since it was found by the learned trial judge that
for the period from 4 February 1993 to 31 March 1993 the first appellant
had established successfully his whereabouts. And it was not in dispute that
the second appellant could rely on the alibi evidence of the first appellant. Hence
that would leave the period from the whole of January 1993 to the 3 February
1993.
For that period the second appellant relied on the assertion that his apartment
at Tivoli Villa was under extensive renovation and thus could not have been
the place of incident. We have already dealt with this issue in respect of the
defence of the first appellant and our view remains the same for the second
appellant.

Apart from our above view there is one more issue respecting the defence of
alibi of the second appellant. Admittedly we have expressed our concurrence
with the learned trial judge as to the validity of the notice of alibi served by
the second appellant after the May 1992 charge was preferred against him
notwithstanding the subsequent amendment. It was the contention of learned
counsel for the second appellant that the said notice expired upon amendment
of the May 1992 charge.

h

In the event that we are wrong in concurring with the view of the learned trial
judge and that the contention of the learned counsel for the second appellant
prevails, we agree with the submission of the learned public prosecutor before
us that the second appellant suffered no prejudice by the refusal of the learned

trial judge to adjourn the hearing. Indeed it is material to consider the actual
nature of the purported evidence of alibi that was finally adduced. It is only
if ‘a trial court having considered the evidence put forward by the defence holds
that such evidence amounts to evidence in support of an alibi for which no
notice under s. 402A Criminal Procedure Code has been given, then he has
no discretion in the matter but to exclude such evidence’ and it is evidence of
alibi if it ‘shows or tends to show that by reason of the presence of the accused
at some particular place or area at a particular time he cannot be or is unlikely
to be at the place where the offence is committed. … that “a true alibi defence
consists of a affirmative proof of the defendant’s presence somewhere other
than at the time and place alleged.”)’ per Abdul Hamid FJ (as he then was)
in Public Prosecutor v. Ku Lip See (supra) at p. 196. Otherwise evidence
adduced by an accused in defence may be ‘in essence a complete denial of the
prosecution case’ wherein a trial judge may treat it as purely a question of
fact thereby making the issue of notice of alibi quite irrelevant.
Thus in the present case with the concession by the learned counsel for the
second appellant as stated hereinabove the issue of notice of alibi becomes
plainly academic. In any event the learned trial judge allowed the second
appellant to adduce all the evidence which was probably thought at that point
in time to be evidence of alibi when it was not. Notwithstanding, the nett effect
of such acquiescence was that the second appellant suffered no prejudice even
with the refusal of the adjournment applied for. It is therefore our considered
opinion that the contention of the learned counsel respecting the refusal by the
learned trial judge to grant the adjournment applied for with the view to serve
a fresh notice of alibi is without merit. And even if indeed an adjournment
should have been granted at that point in time as it was not known then the
nature of the alibi evidence to be adduced, in view of what subsequently
transpired we are of the view that in the circumstances of this present case
the invocation of the proviso to s. 60(1) of the CJA would be appropriate.
Learned counsel for the second appellant also touched on P4 as having been
retracted and thus of no evidential value.
We have already dealt with this matter hereinabove and say no more.

Abetment Charge Against The Second Appellant
On the charge of abetment learned counsel for the second appellant submitted
that the learned trial judge erred in convicting his client since there was no
evidence to support such charge. It was contended that if the second appellant
had intended to lure Azizan to the apartment he would have informed him of
the address. Further, it was argued that the mere presence of the second
appellant did not make him an aider and abettor.

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

495

On this charge it was a finding of fact by the learned trial judge that ‘the
prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that in fact and in law
Sukma abetted Dato’ Seri Anwar in the commission of the act of sodomy on
Azizan as particularized in the first charge against Sukma’. And he relied on
the following:

a

(i) the evidence of Azizan that he was invited by the second appellant to the
latter’s apartment without being informed that the first appellant would be
present;

b

(ii) in P4 the second appellant admitted that at the request of the first appellant
he took the latter to his apartment to meet Azizan; and

c

(iii) that from the evidence of Azizan and P4 the second appellant was present
when the first appellant sodomized Azizan.
On the evidence before him it was the conclusions of the learned trial judge
that the acts of the second appellant in inviting Azizan to the apartment and
making arrangement for the first appellant to be present to sodomize him
(Azizan) were:

d

(a) ‘acts which connect Sukma (the second appellant) with the steps of the
transaction which are criminal’;
(b) ‘acts which show that Sukma intentionally aided and abetted the
commission of the offence as envisaged under the third limb of s. 107
of the Code (the Penal Code) and are also acts done by Sukma to
facilitate the commission of the offence under explanation 2 of s. 107
of the Code’; and

e

(c) the ‘evidence of active complicity on the part of Sukma and is caught
by s. 109 of the Code’.

f

It was also the finding of the learned trial judge that by evidence it was
established ‘that Sukma was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the
commission of the offence by Dato’ Seri Anwar and offered no opposition to
it or at least to express his dissent. Thus the presence of Sukma cannot be
taken to mean mere presence but more to it, it would under the circumstances
afford cogent evidence which would justify this court in finding that Sukma
wilfully encouraged the commission of the offence and so aided and abetted it.’

Now, in Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Haji Harun Haji Idris [1979] 1 MLJ
180 at p. 196 his Lordship Abdoolcader J (as he then was) opined that there
are three limbs in s. 107 of the Penal Code namely, ‘abetment by instigation,
conspiracy and intentionally aiding’. And he went on to explain each of the
limbs in this way:

Instigation consists of acts which amount to active suggestion or support or
stimulation for the commission of the main act or offence. Advice can also
become instigation if that advice is meant to actively suggest or stimulate the
commission of an offence (Ragunath Das v. Emperor [1920] 21 Cr LJ 213).
Abetment by conspiracy consists in the combination and agreement of persons
to do some illegal act or to effect some illegal purpose by illegal means. Proof
of conspiracy need not be direct proof but can be a matter of inference
deducted from certain criminal acts of the accused done in pursuance of an
apparent criminal purpose in common between them (Emperor v. Abdul Hamid
[1945] 46 Cr LR 342). Abetment by aiding takes place when a person by
the commission of an act intends to facilitate and does in fact facilitate the
commission of an offence (Faguna Kanta Nath v. State of Assam AIR [1959]
SC 673). Where there is shown a positive act of assistance voluntarily done
by a person with a knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence,
the abettor is guilty of abetment by aiding (National Coal Board v. Gamble
[1959] 1 QB 11).

The learned trial judge in the present case may not have clearly stated which
limb or limbs the acts and omissions of the second appellant came under.
However, in our view it can be discerned from his findings that the least such
acts or omissions can come under should be the third limb. It was the evidence
of Azizan that he was invited by the second appellant to come to his apartment
without informing him that the first appellant would be there too. And in P4
the second appellant admitted to have picked up the first appellant and brought
him to his apartment to meet Azizan. Further, in P4 as well the second
appellant admitted to have invited Azizan to his apartment at the behest of the
first appellant. These pieces of evidence all pointed to the fact that the second
appellant facilitated and did facilitate in the commission of the offence of
sodomy by the first appellant.
Otherwise generally speaking the acts and omissions of the second appellant
can come under all the limbs in s. 107 of the Penal Code. In any event, by
the mere failure of the learned trial judge to clearly indicate the limb or limbs
we do not think the second appellant has been prejudiced in anyway. More so
when the findings of the learned trial judge are findings of facts in which an
appellate court and we are, has limited reasons to interfere. (See: Public
Prosecutor v. Wan Razali Kassim (supra).
In fact in criticizing the findings of the learned trial judge respecting the
evidence against the second appellant for the first charge, it was also a criticism
on the learned trial judge, albeit indirectly, on his assessment of Azizan as a
witness and the nature of his testimony and the admission of P4 and the truth
therein. We have already expressed our views on these crucial points and we
say no more. Suffice it for us to state here that we find no serious errors in
the approach and assessment by the learned trial Judge of the evidence adduced

[2003] 4 CLJ

by both sides in respect of the first charge preferred against the second
appellant. We also find no flaw in his application of the evidence to the
ingredients of the offence with reference to decided cases such as Ferguson v.
Weaving [1951] 1 KB 814; The Queen v. Coney & Ors [1882] 8 QBD 534
and Public Prosecutor v. Tee Tean Siong & Ors [1963] MLJ 201. (See also:
Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Tan Cheng Swee & Ors [1979] 1 MLJ 166).

a

b

Accordingly we find no merit in the ground of appeal and submissions of
learned counsel for the second appellant against the conviction of the second
appellant on the charge for abetment.
Other Points Considered
We are conscious that there are other points raised in respect of all the
convictions by the learned counsel for the appellants and the learned public
prosecutor which we have not specifically dealt with in this judgment. However
we state here that we have in fact considered them before coming to our
decision. And even if some of our views on those points might be in tandem
with the contentions of learned counsel for the appellants, we say that those
points in our views are not of material nature as to have any effect to our
decision as a whole in these appeals. In any event, we would say that generally
we agree with the findings and conclusions of the learned trial judge on those
points.
The Application Of The Proviso To Section 60(1) Of The CJA
In respect of the application of the proviso to s. 60(1) of the CJA it was the
submission of learned counsel for the first appellant that it should only be
applied in exceptional cases. He cited the case of Abdillah bin Lobo Khan v.
Public Prosecutor [2002] 3 CLJ 521. It was also his plea that to apply the
proviso would cause substantial miscarriage of justice in view of the evidence
of Azizan.
We do not think there is any dispute as to the application of the said proviso.
That has been made clear in a series of cases by this court. Our Federal Court
has a similar proviso applicable thereto. Thus, very well aware of such principle
of law we have deliberated carefully on the overall nature of the evidence in
these appeals and the approach adopted by the learned trial judge. Admittedly
there may be some mis-directions on his part, for instance his reliance on P4
as against the first appellant. We have addressed that issue. There is also the
issue of s. 402A of the CPC that became one of the main planks to the
contentions of the appellants in these appeals. Nevertheless, having considered
the totality of the evidence adduced, the submissions of learned counsel for the
appellants and the learned public prosecutor and having read and re-read the
grounds of judgment of the learned trial judge and on the facts and in the

circumstances of these appeals heard jointly, it is our considered opinion that
no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred and based on our views given
above we consider it an exceptional case, hence it is a fit and proper case to
apply the proviso to s. 60(1) of the CJA. (See: Basil bin Omar v. Public
Prosecutor [2003] 4 CLJ 418; Tunde Apatira & Ors v. Public Prosecutor
[2001] 1 CLJ 381; K Saravanan a/l S Karuppiah v. Public Prosecutor [2002]
4 CLJ 144).
Overall Conclusion
For the above reasons we dismissed the appeals by both the appellants against
their convictions on the charges preferred against them respectively.
On Sentence
In submitting for the first appellant learned counsel referred to s. 25 of the
Akta Jenayah Syariah wherein for an offence of sodomy the maximum
punishment is three years imprisonment, a fine of RM5,000 and strokes. And
it was his contention that indeed there is a great disparity in term of sentence
with s. 377B of the Penal Code. It was also submitted that the sentence of
nine years imprisonment is manifestly excessive. And it was also contended that
the previous conviction of the first appellant should not be taken into account
as there is still a pending application for its review.
For the second appellant it was submitted that the sentences imposed are
manifestly excessive. It was also contended that the imposition of the strokes
was unnecessary since such punishment should only be meted out where violence
was involved in the commission of the crime which was absent in this case.
It is settled law that an appellate court should not interfere in a sentence
imposed by a trial court unless it is satisfied that such sentence is manifestly
inadequate or excessive or illegal or otherwise not a proper sentence having
regard to all the facts and circumstances disclosed or that the court below has
clearly erred in applying the correct principles when assessing the sentence to
be imposed. (See: Public Prosecutor v. Loo Choon Fatt [1976] 2 MLJ 256).
In these appeals the only complaint is that the sentences of imprisonment or
the length thereof are manifestly excessive. And for the second appellant it was
highlighted that there was no violence involved. But it is not for an appellate
court to interfere a sentence imposed merely because it would have passed a
different sentence. (See: Public Prosecutor v. Fam Kim Hock [1954] 23 MLJ 20).

h

i

As to whether or not a sentence imposed is excessive, such issue has to be
premised on the fact that in imposing sentence a trial judge is exercising his
discretion. And we can do no better than to echo the view of Raja Azlan Shah
(Ag LP) (as His Royal Highness then was) in the case of Bhandulananda
Jayatilake v. Public Prosecutor [1982] 1 MLJ 83 where his Lordship said at
p. 84:

CLJ



[2003] 4 CLJ

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP & Another Appeal

499

As this is an appeal against the exercise by the learned judge of a discretion
vested in him, is the sentence so far outside the normal discretionary limits
as to enable this court to say that its imposition must have involved an error
of law of some description? I have had occasion to say elsewhere, that the
very concept of judicial discretion involves a right to choose between more
than one possible course of action upon which there is room for reasonable
people to hold differing opinions as to which is to be preferred. That is quite
inevitable. Human nature being what it is, different judges applying the same
principles at the same time in the same country to similar facts may sometimes
reach different conclusions (see Jamieson v. Jamieson [[1952] AC 525). It is
for that reason that some very conscientious judges have thought it their duty
to visit particular crimes with exemplary sentences; whilst others, equally
conscientious, have thought it their duty to view the same crimes with
leniency. Therefore sentences do vary in apparently similar circumstances with
the habit of mind of the particular judge. It is for that reason also that this
court has said it again and again it will not normally interfere with sentences,
and the possibility or even the probability, that another court would have
imposed a different sentence is not sufficient per se to warrant this court’s
interference.

d

In the present case we note that before imposing the sentences on the appellants
the learned trial judge considered several matters. In respect of the first appellant
the learned trial judge took into account the following:
(i)

that the first appellant did not show at all any sign of remorse, instead
displayed an attitude of arrogance and attack on the Bench and his
purported political rivals;

(ii)

the seriousness of the offence as reflected by the penalty provided;

(iii)

the lofty status and the position of responsibility of the first appellant at
the material time and the need to exemplify high moral standard;

(iv)

the fact that due to the age of the first appellant no whipping is allowed
but the alternative is for a longer term of imprisonment that may be
imposed;

(v)

that the first appellant has a previous conviction;

(vi)

that the sentence has to be made consecutive to the then sentence being
served by the first appellant since the offence of sodomy is quite distinct
from the offence in his previous conviction;

(vii) that the service of the first appellant to the nation has been taken into
account although there was hardly any mitigating factors submitted on
his behalf; and
(viii) that the length of sentence of imprisonment is reflective of the seriousness
of the offence for which the first appellant has been convicted.

From the foregoing and in respect of the first appellant we are of the view
that the learned trial judge has taken all the relevant factors into consideration
in the process of sentencing. Public interest demands such considerations. There
is no denial that the first appellant had engaged to defend him no less than a
team of senior counsel with vast knowledge and experience in criminal work.
All conceivable arguments were taken up. All grievances, both justified and
unjustified, against anyone that could be remembered, were allowed. We agree
with the approach adopted by the learned trial judge.
As to the argument that the previous conviction of the first appellant should
not be taken into account for the moment since there is a pending review, with
respect that is not for us to judge at this stage. In so far as this court is
concerned that conviction has been upheld by the highest court of the country
and that is the position until it is reversed. There is therefore no merit in that
contention and we reject it.
Accordingly we find no reason to interfere with the sentence passed by the
learned trial judge on the first appellant and hereby affirm it. His appeal against
sentence is therefore dismissed.
As for the second appellant the learned trial judge considered these:

e

(a) the fact that a sentence of whipping can be imposed, hence that attracts
lesser term of imprisonment;
(b) that the health reason of the second appellant is a matter for the medical
authority to consider in respect of the execution of the sentence of
whipping;

f

(c) that the learned trial judge found no compelling reason for a lighter sentence
for the second appellant; and
(d) that for the two convictions the learned trial judge imposed concurrent
sentences of imprisonment.

g

h

We note that the learned trial judge did not take into account the fact that the
second appellant has one previous conviction related to the offence of sodomy
as well. Be that as it may we are not convinced that the learned trial judge
erred in any way in his process of sentencing the second appellant. And for
the same reason we stated in respect of the first appellant we find no ground
to interfere with the sentences imposed on the second appellant by the learned
trial judge in the exercise of his discretion. Accordingly we also dismiss his
appeal against sentence and affirm the sentences passed by the learned trial
judge.
