The appellant (‘the accused’) was apprehended at the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport whilst attempting to board a flight from Kuala
Lumpur to Frankfurt. The alarm was triggered when the accused walked
through a detector. The security officer (‘PW1’) then carried out a body
check and felt some hard items on the accused’s legs. The accused
claimed that his legs were blistered. PW1 found some bandages on the
accused’s thighs and calves. The accused refused to allow PW1 to
remove the bandages. When the bandages were removed, three plastic
packages were found bandaged on each thigh, and one plastic package
on each calf. All eight packages contained a total of 1836g of heroin.
The accused was charged with the offence of trafficking in heroin, in
contravention of s. 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. In his
defence, the accused testified that he was an innocent carrier, acting

(1) The accused’s state of mind may be gathered from the evidence of
what he did or failed to do or what he said on the occasion in
question; and in order to arrive at a finding of knowledge, the court

explanations and denials made by the accused and his conduct on
the occasion in question; PP v. Badrulsham Baharom (refd).

(2) The accused was found to have eight packages strapped to his

accused. He had lied that his legs were blistered and refused to
allow PW1 to open the bandages or remove them for examination.
In the absence of any plausible or reasonable explanation by the
accused, these facts were sufficient for the trial court to make an
affirmative inference and finding that the accused had knowledge of
the enormous quantity of heroin and that he was in actual
possession of the proscribed drug ie, heroin. (para 16)
(3) Under s. 105 of the Evidence Act 1950, the burden was on the
accused to establish the defence of threats. There was not an iota

to his apprehension of instant death or to his life or limb. The
defence was devoid of merits. (paras 19 & 20)
(4) The learned judge had not erred in his finding, beyond reasonable

JUDGMENT
Low Hop Bing JCA:
Appeal
[1]
The appellant (“the accused”) was charged with the offence of
trafficking in heroin, in contravention of s. 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous
Drugs Act 1952 and punishable under s. 39B(2) thereof. (Unless
otherwise stated, a reference hereinafter to a section is a reference to
that section in the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952).

He was convicted and sentenced to death by the Shah Alam High
Court. This is his appeal against the conviction and sentence.
Finding Of Facts
[3]
After a full trial, the narrative of facts as found by the learned
trial judge unfolded that on 17 October 2000, at about 9pm, a security
assistant (“PW1”) was on duty at Gate C1 and Gate C3, Satellite
Building, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, together with another
colleague (“PW8”) and one Ramly. At about 10.10pm, PW1 was at
Gate C3 to carry out security checks on passengers boarding flight
MH006 from Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt.
[4]
At about 10.40pm, the accused went through the first “walkthrough detector”, which then triggered an alarm. PW8 directed the
accused to go through the second “walk-through detector”, which also
triggered an alarm. With the accused’s permission, PW1 carried out a
body check, by frisking the accused’s body with his (PW1’s) hands.
Upon touching some hard items on the accused’s legs, PW1 asked the
accused what the hard items were. The accused replied that his legs
were blistered. PW1 told PW8 that the accused’s explanation was not
convincing. Both PW1 and PW8 then led the accused to the security

room. PW1 lifted the accused’s trousers and saw, on the accused’s
calves, some bandages. The accused refused to allow PW1 to remove
the bandages. PW1 and PW8 accompanied the accused to the police
base. On the way, PW1 stopped at the Immigration Department, located
in the building, to enable Immigration personnel to make the necessary
endorsement on the accused’s passport. The accused was not allowed
to leave Kuala Lumpur for Frankfurt. The “exit” stamp of the
Immigration, endorsed earlier on the accused’s passport, was duly
re-endorsed “void”.
[5]
At the police base, PW1 directed the accused to remove his
trousers, whereupon PW1 found that the accused’s thighs and calves
were wrapped in bandages. There were three plastic packages bandaged
on each thigh, and one plastic package on each calf. PW1 seized the
accused’s air ticket, boarding pass and passport. The chemist (‘PW6’)
confirmed that, on analysis, all the eight packages contained a total of
1836g of heroin.
[6]
In his defence, the accused testified that he was an innocent
carrier, acting under duress and threat to himself and his family with no
knowledge of what he was carrying and he did that at the behest of
one Ah Hai.
Knowledge And Innocent Carrier

F

[7]
Learned defence counsel Mr RV Lingam submitted that the
accused had no knowledge of the heroin, which the accused thought was
medicine, and so the accused was an innocent carrier.
[8]
The stand taken by learned Deputy Public Prosecutor
Ms Nurulhuda Nur’aini bt Mohd Noor is that the accused was not an
innocent carrier, as the prosecution had discharged the burden of proving
knowledge and actual possession against him.

G

[9]
In our view, the immediate question that must be answered under
this head is whether the learned judge was correct in finding that the
accused had possession and knowledge of the contents of the eight
packages bandaged to his thighs and calves.
H

I

[10] In Leow Nghee Lim v. Regina [1955] 1 LNS 53, Taylor J had the
occasion to consider the meaning of possession in relation to a charge
of possession of chandu. He was of the view that:
(a) the most helpful definition of possession is “the relation of a person
to a thing over which he may at his pleasure exercise such control
as to the character of the thing admits, to the exclusion of other
persons”. This definition includes some element of knowledge of the



100

Current Law Journal

[2012] 10 CLJ

existence of a chattel and some idea of its whereabouts before he
can exercise any control over it, thereby importing mens rea as an
essential element; and

A

(b) how much a man knows about things in, or apparently in, his
possession is a matter of fact, to be inferred from all the
circumstances: See also Emmanuel Yaw Teiku v. PP [2006] 3 CLJ
597.

B

[11] In Chan Pean Leon v. PP [1956] 1 LNS 17, Thomson J (later LP)
explained the meaning of the word “possession” in the context of
assisting in the carrying on of a public lottery under s. 4(1)(c) of the
Common Gaming Houses Ordinance (now Act) 1953. He propounded
that:

C

(a) There can be no possession without knowledge, as an essential
ingredient of all possession is that there must be an intention to
exercise the power of disposal in case of need to exercise that
power to the exclusion of other persons; and

D

(b) There are therefore two elements viz a physical element which may
be proved by direct evidence; and a mental element or animus
possidendi ie, intention, which in the nature of things, cannot be
proved by direct evidence, but by inference from the surrounding
circumstances, and it is impossible to lay down any general rule.

E

[12] The accused’s state of mind may be gathered from the evidence
of what he did or failed to do or what he said on the occasion in
question; and in order to arrive at a finding of knowledge, the court will
have to consider the totality of the evidence, including the explanations
and denials made by the accused and his conduct on the occasion in
question: See PP v. Badrulsham Baharom [1987] 1 LNS 72 per Lim
Beng Choon J (as he then was).

F

G

[13] In Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1968] 2 All ER 356
HL, 375I to 376A, the House of Lords pointed out that:
(a) If the accused had a suspicion but deliberately shut his eyes, the
court is well entitled to hold him guilty. Further, it would be
pedantic to hold that it must be shown that the accused knew
precisely which drug he had in his possession. Ignorance of the law
is no defence and in fact virtually everyone knows that there are
prohibited drugs. So it would be quite sufficient to prove facts which
it could properly be inferred that the accused knew that he had a
prohibited drug in his possession. This would not lead to an
unreasonable result: per Lord Reid at p. 367E to F.

(b) If someone deliberately assumes control of some package or
container, then he is in possession of it. If he deliberately so
assumes control knowing that it has contents, he would also be in
possession of the contents. It would not be rational to hold that
someone, who is in possession of a box which he knows to have
things in it, is in possession of the box but not in possession of
the things in it. If he had been misinformed or misled as to the
nature of the contents, or if he had made a wrong surmise as to
them, he would nevertheless be in possession of them: per Lord
Morris at pp. 375I to 376A.
(c) In all cases, the starting point will be that the accused had physical
control of something – a package, a bottle, a container - found to
contain the substance. This is evidence - generally strong evidence
- of possession. It calls for an explanation. The explanation will be
heard and the jury (in Malaysia, the court) must decide whether
there is genuine ignorance of the presence of the substance, or such
an acceptance of the package with all that it might contain, or with
such opportunity to ascertain what it did contain or such guilty
knowledge with regard to it as to make up the statutory possession:
per Lord Wilberforce at 394E (words in bracket added).
[14] The above propositions were affirmed by the Federal Court in
PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif [2007] 4 CLJ 337, in considering the issue of
knowledge as a necessary element to establish possession: per Arifin
Zakaria FCJ (now CJ(M)).
[15]

Illustration of the inference of knowledge include:

(a) Emmanuel Yaw Teiku, supra, where 515.7g of heroin were found in
the stomach of the accused who initially refused to undergo the
X-ray procedure. The Federal Court held that this indicated the
accused’s knowledge of what was inside his body;
(b) Roslan Sabu v. PP [2006] 3 CLJ 607, where the accused was
carrying the two transparent plastic carrier bags with glaring sight
of the drugs, and the plastic wrappers were transparent, thereby
fulfilling the element of knowledge ie, mens rea to constitute
possession on the part of the accused;
(c) Teh Hock Leong v. PP [2008] 4 CLJ 764, where the method
employed by the accused to bring the drugs in question from
Thailand into Malaysia was done in a most cunning fashion to
escape detection by the authorities; and

Current Law Journal

[2012] 10 CLJ

(d) Syed Ali Syed Abdul Hamid & Anor v. PP [1982] CLJ 188; [1982]
CLJ (Rep) 340 at p. 346, where the representation the accused
made to a prosecution witness therein regarding the purpose of
borrowing the car was a deliberate lie; such lie was held to be a
reflection of his consciousness of guilt as regards the use he
intended to make of the car in question.
[16] In the instant appeal, it is significant to state that the accused was
found to have eight packages strapped to his thighs and calves. They
were concealed on the person of the accused. He had lied that his legs
were blistered and refused to allow PW1 to open the bandages or
remove them for examination. In the absence of any plausible or
reasonable explanation by the accused, these facts are sufficient for the
trial court to make an affirmative inference and finding that the accused
had knowledge of the enormous quantity of heroin and that he was in
actual possession of the proscribed drug ie, heroin.

A

B

C

D

[17] As the prosecution had proved the accused’s actual possession of
1,836g of heroin, and the weight thereof far exceeded the statutory
trigger of 15g, the presumption of trafficking as provided in s. 37(da)(i)
is activated against the accused. We are of the view that the High Court
had correctly held that the accused was in actual possession of the
heroin and that the weight in question being in excess of the statutory
trigger had effectively activated the presumption of trafficking pursuant
to s. 37(da)(i).

E

Threats
[18] The next and final issue raised for the accused is the defence of
threats. This defence must be considered by reference to s. 94 of the
Penal Code which states:
94.

F

Act to which a person is compelled by threats.
G

Except murder, offences included in Chapter VI punishable with death
and offences included in Chapter VIA, nothing is an offence which is
done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which at the
time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death
to that person will otherwise be the consequence:
H

Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own
accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself
short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which
he became subject to such constraint.
I



[2012] 10 CLJ
A

B

Koh Keng Guan v. PP

103

[19] The simple and straightforward question for determination under
this head is whether there is any evidence to sustain the applicability of
this defence. Under s. 105 of the Evidence Act 1950, the burden is on
the accused to establish the defence.
[20] Upon a careful consideration of this issue, we are unable to find
any iota of evidence to show that the accused was under any threat to
lead to his apprehension of instant death or to his life or limb. We have
no difficulty in dismissing this defence as it is devoid of merits.

I

[21] The learned judge has not erred in his finding, beyond reasonable
doubt, that the accused had actual possession of the eight plastic
packages and the dangerous drugs, and that the accused had not
rebutted the presumption of trafficking under s. 37(da)(i). Hence, we
dismissed the accused’s appeal and affirmed the entire decision of the
High Court.
