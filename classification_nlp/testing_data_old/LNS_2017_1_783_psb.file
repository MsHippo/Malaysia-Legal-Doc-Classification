JUDGMENT
[1]

The 1 st and 2 nd accused were charged for murder under s. 302
read together with s. 34 of the Penal Code. Both accused
pleaded not guilty to the charge. The charge reads as follows:
“Bahawa kamu bersama-sama pada 30.1.2015, di antara jam 9.00
malam sehingga 11.00 malam, di No.82, Matang Family Park,
Jalan Matang, dalam daerah Kuching, di dalam negeri Sarawak,

bagi mencapai niat bersama kamu telah membunuh Hii Nek Kah
(L) (KPT: 481010-13-5727), dan dengan itu kamu telah
melakukan suatu kesalahan dibawah Seksyen 302 Kanun
Keseksaan dan dibaca bersama seksyen 34 kanun yang sama.”
[2]

In its opening statement, which was read out in court, the
prosecution stated that both accused were charged for an offence
under s. 302 of the Penal Code read together with s. 34 of the
Penal Code for causing the death of Hii Nek Kah on 30.1.2015
at about 9.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m. at No.82, Matang Family Park,
Jalan Matang, in the District of Kuching, in the State of
Sarawak.

[3]

The learned DPP informed the court that the prosecution would
rely on direct, medical, scientific and circumstantial evidence to
prove that both accused persons were present at the crime scene
and in furtherance of a common intention to cause the death of
the deceased. He said from the totality of the evidence to be
adduced, the prosecution would prove beyond reasonable doubt
that both accused persons had intentionally caused the death of
the deceased.

[4]

Section 180(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) provides
that when the case for the prosecution is concluded, the court
shall consider whether the prosecution has made out a prima
facie case against the accused. Under subsection(4), a prima
facie case is made out where the prosecution has adduced
credible evidence proving each ingredient of the offence which
if unrebutted or unexplained would warrant a conviction.

[5]

The duty of a judge sitting alone, at the close of the case for the
prosecution, is to determine as a trier of fact whether the
prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the accused
person. He must subject the evidence of the prosecution to a

CLJ 734.
[6]

Culpable homicide and murder are defined in s. 299 and s. 300
of the Penal Code respectively. Section 34 of the Penal Code
provides that when a criminal act is done by several persons, in
furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons
is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done
by him alone.

[7]

In order to establish a prima facie case against the accused
under ss. 302 and 34 of the Penal Code, the prosecution has to
prove: (a) the death of the deceased; (b) that the deceased died
as a result of injuries sustained by him; (c) that the injuries
which resulted in the deceased’s death were caused by the acts
of the accused; (d) in inflicting the injuries upon the deceased,
the accused caused them with the intention of causing death, or
caused them with the intention of causing such bodily injuries as
they knew to be likely to cause the death of the deceased, or
cause them with the intention of causing bodily injuries and
such injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
cause death, or caused them with the knowledge that the acts
were so imminently dangerous that they must in all probabilities
cause death and committed such acts without any excuse for
incurring the risks of causing death or such injuries as aforesaid;
and (e) that the acts of both accused which resulted in the death
of the deceased were in furtherance of the common intention of
all.

The deceased was the owner of the house situated at No. 82,
Matang Family Park, Jalan Matang, Kuching. At that time he
was renovating the house to operate it as a home-stay business.
He had engaged a contractor to carry out the renovations. Some

5



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

employees of the contractor were given a place to stay at the
workers’ quarters during the renovations. PW1, a friend of the
deceased, who helped with painting in the house, stayed in the
house to accompany the deceased.
[9]

On 30.1.2015 at about 9.00 p.m. the deceased woke PW1 from
his sleep after the deceased’s car alarm went off. While they
were talking in the dining room, two persons entered the house
through the back door of the house, one with a knife and one
with a stick, approaching towards them. PW1, upon seeing the
two persons armed with the weapons, warned the deceased of
the intruders and ran inside and locked the door of his bedroom.
He heard the deceased calling out for help and someone
knocking on the door trying to open the door of his bedroom.
PW1 escaped using the bedroom window and ran to the road
seeking for help.

[10] He stopped a car asking for help from the driver who took him
to a police station where PW1 told the police about what
happened. He also informed the family of the deceased. Two
sons of the deceased including PW2 arrived at the house before
the police. PW2 said they arrived at about midnight. They found
the gate not in its place and their father’s Toyota Prado vehicle
missing. They called out their father’s name but there was no
answer and the front door locked. PW2 went to the back of the
house and found the backdoor open and there was a hole in the
door. He entered the house and found his father dead. He found
that a drawer in his father’s bedroom had been forced open, cash
of RM7,000.00 and his father’s two hand-phones missing. He
said subsequently he found that the cash was in fact
RM14,000.00 which was to pay for the wages and renovations
for the house. The police and PW1 arrived at the house later.
PW1 lodged a police report which was tendered as exhibit P4.

PW2 also lodged a police report which was tendered as exhibit
P18.
[11] At about 11.00 p.m. a police mobile patrol, carrying random
checks at the Kuching waterfront, stopped a Toyota Prado
bearing registration QC9935. There were six persons in the
vehicle, namely Mohamad Nazarie b. Halidi (1 st accused), Suffry
anak Empi (2 nd accused), Nizam bin Roslan, Noraini binte
Kifflie, Justira bin Mohd Kuan also known as Dedeng and a
child. When the police stopped the vehicle Nizam and Justira
ran away. The police managed to apprehend Nizam but failed to
apprehend Justira. He was arrested subsequently, but the date of
his arrest was not given during the prosecution’s case. The 1 st
accused, 2 nd accused, Nizam and Noraini were detained for
questioning at the Kuching central police station (CPS). PW2
identified the said Toyota Prado vehicle to belong to the
deceased. The Toyota Prado was taken and driven from the
house by the six persons. The 1 st and 2 nd accused persons were
charged for the murder. The other three were not. Did any or all
of them commit the murder?
[12] PW8, a forensic medicine specialist attached to the Sarawak
General Hospital (SGH), was requested to go to the crime scene.
She arrived at about 3.30 a.m. on 31.1.2015 but only allowed to
enter the house about ten minutes later. She confirmed the death
of the deceased at 3.40 a.m. On the same day at 4.40 a.m., the
body of the deceased was brought to SGH.
[13] On 2.2.2015 at 9.30 a.m. PW8 conducted a post mortem on the
deceased at the mortuary of SGH. The body of the deceased was
identified by PW2 and by PW18, who was the investigation
officer (IO) of the case. PW8 prepared a post mortem report
which was tendered as exhibit P57.

[14] PW8 testified as a witness and prepared her CV which set out

[15] PW8 then testified on her findings on the internal injuries to the
head, mouth and neck structures of the deceased. She said the
subgaleal haematoma, meaning bruising underneath the scalp,
was noted over the vertex (top) of the head, an area of 20 x 8cm,
and multiple skull fractures were noted over the cranial vault
mainly over the left side, measuring an area of 17 x 12cm,
extending to left middle cranial fossa (base of skull depression)
and left anterior (front) cranial fossa. She said the fractures
were due to injury no. 6 to no.8. She said the brain (1400gm)
had subdural haemorrhage, meaning bleeding underneath the
brain covering, and subarachnoid bleeding, which is bleeding on
the surface of the brain, were generalised. Cortical contusion
(bruising at grey matter of the brain) was noted over the base of
left temporal, measuring an area of 9 x 5cm. A laceration was
noted over the left parietal lobe measuring about 3.5 x 1.5cm
and just above it at the left temporal, there was an incised
wound measuring about 2cm. She said the tongue, hyoid bone
and thyroid cartilage were normal, the neck muscle and major
blood vessels of the neck were not injured and the cervical bone
was not fractured.
[16] She said out of these injuries, two were due to sharp force
trauma, two was a combination of blunt and sharp force trauma
and the rest were due to blunt force trauma. She said her
examination revealed that as a result of injury no.6 to injury no.
8, the deceased suffered multiple skull fractures and underlying
brain injuries including generalised subdural and subarachnoid
bleeding, contusion, laceration and incision. She said the
deceased suffered injuries consistent with defensive injuries. In
her opinion, the injuries to the head caused the death of the
deceased.

10



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

[17] She said the slashed wounds as seen at injury no.6 were
consistent to be caused by a sharp and heavy weapon such as a
cleaver, parang, golok or any other similar object while the
incisions at injury no.8 and injury no.11 were consistent to be
caused by a circular, heavy and blunt object such as hammer
face, handle of a parang or any other similar object. The
lacerations as seen in injury no.6 and 7 were consistent to be
caused by blunt force trauma such as being hit by something
hard and blunt such as wood, iron or any similar object.
[18] PW8 said that the cause of death to the deceased was head
injuries due to sharp and blunt force trauma. The defence did not
lead any evidence to the contrary on the time of death or the
cause of death. On the evidence and surrounding circumstances,
the injuries inflicted to the head were sufficient in the ordinary
course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.
[19] The prosecution submitted that it was never disputed during the
trial that the deceased had died due to the injuries he suffered
and that its case depended entirely on circumstantial evidence. It
was submitted that PW1 had identified the 1 st and 2 nd accused as
the two persons armed with weapons who had entered the house
on that night. He was able to identify them because he was face
to face with them and he had seen them working at the house.
The prosecution submitted that although after PW1 had run into
his bedroom and did not see or knew what exactly happened to
the deceased, there was overwhelming circumstantial evidence
and DNA evidence that both accused had entered the house and
inflicted the injuries which caused the death of the deceased. It
was submitted that both accused had common intention to kill
the deceased on that night. The prosecution cited numerous
authorities in support of its submission.

11



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

[20] The defence submitted that the prosecution has failed to
establish a prima facie case against both accused persons
because: (a) it has not been proven that they were involved in
the killing; (b) PW1’s identification of the accused as the two
persons armed with weapons entering the house on that night
was doubtful and not correct; (c) the prosecution failed to call
Nizam bin Roslan, Noraini binte Kifflie and Justira bin Mohd
Kuan as witnesses to explain what happened on that night
because one of them could have committed the murder; (d) the
prosecution failed to prove that the accused had an intention
with a motive to kill the deceased; and (e) it did not lead any
evidence of any common intention between the accused to kill
the deceased. The defence has also cited many authorities.
[21] In respect of the 1 st accused, it was submitted inter alia that (i)
no finger print was lifted from any of the weapons found or
recovered to tie the 1 st accused to them; (ii) nothing belonging
to the 1 st accused was found at the scene of crime, for example
hair sample and his blood; (iii) no nail clippings were taken
from him for DNA analysis; (iv) the discovery of the deceased’s
blood on a pair of trousers with size ‘XXL’ did not belong to the
1 st accused because he wore size ‘S’ which in fact belonged to
Nizam bin Roslan; (v) the belt allegedly used to hold up the
trousers did not belong to the 1 st accused; (vi) the blood could
have been smeared on the trousers to incriminate the 1 st accused;
(vii) if in fact there was blood on it when the trousers and belt
were seized from the 1st accused at CPS Kuching, it would have
been noted in the lock-up register; (viii) it was strange that
bloodstains from the 1 st accused were found on a shirt belonging
to the 1 st accused but no bloodstains from the deceased were
found on the shirt if the 1 st accused was at the scene at the time
of murder; and (ix) at that time the 1 st accused was sleeping in

12



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

the workers’ quarters when he was told by the driver of the
stolen vehicle to run away and he blindly followed to the Toyota
Prado.
[22] On behalf of the 2 nd accused, it was submitted that the he did not
commit the murder because (i) a weapon described as a sickle,
found on a sofa chair in the house, which was tendered as
exhibit P10, could not be the weapon used by any of the accused
in the murder because PW1 said that he had not seen this sickle;
(ii) there was no bloodstain on it; (iii) although the deceased’s
blood was splattered on the kitchen wall, kitchen cabinet and
sink, no bloodstain was found on the trousers seized from the 2 nd
accused if he was present at the scene at the time of the murder;
and (iv) at the time of his arrest sitting inside the Toyota Prado,
which was driven by Justira, he did not run away because he did
not do it whereas Justira and Nizam ran away indicating their
guilt.
[23] Although they were in the Toyota Prado vehicle together with
the 1 st and 2 nd accused on that night, the prosecution did not call
Nizam, Noriani or Justira as witnesses. It is clear law that while
the prosecution has a complete discretion as to the choice of
witnesses to be called at the trial, it also has a duty to call all
necessary witnesses to establish proof against the accused
beyond all reasonable doubt: Ti Chuee Hiang v. Public
Prosecutor [1995] 3 CLJ 1. Were there any miscarriage of
justice or adverse inference against the prosecution or have the
accused raised any doubt on the prosecution’s case in failing to
call Nizam, Noraini and Justira as witnesses?
[24] The prosecution has subpoenaed Nizam bin Roslan, Noraini bte
Kifflie and Justira bin Mohd Kuan but they were not called to
testify as witnesses. The prosecution submitted that they were

13



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

not at the crime scene but were only inside the Toyota Prado and
they were only accomplices in the theft of the vehicle. It was
submitted that pursuant to s. 114(b) of the Evidence Act, they
were unworthy of credit and there was no valid reason to call
them as witnesses. Instead the prosecution offered them to the
defence at the end of the prosecution’s case.
[25] On the facts and circumstances of the case, there was nothing to
suggest that in not calling them as witnesses that the prosecution
was suppressing evidence and there was no ground to invoke any
adverse inference against the prosecution as such: see
Munusamy v. Public Prosecutor [1987] 1 MLJ 492; Hazly bin
Ali v. Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2015] 1 MLJ 527;
Amri bin Ibrahim & Anor v. Public Prosecutor and another
appeal [2017] 1 MLJ 1. The burden was still on the prosecution
to prove its case against the accused.
[26] The evidence showed that about two hours after the two armed
persons had entered the house, the police stopped the Toyota
Prado at the waterfront with the 1 st and 2 nd accused, Nizam bin
Roslan, Justira bin Mohd Kuan and Noraini bte Kifflie inside.
This vehicle belonged to the deceased which was taken and
driven by them after the incident in the house. PW4 said that
when he stopped the vehicle, Justira was in the driver’s seat.
Therefore the defence submitted that Justira had taken the car
key and stole the vehicle, implying that he was present in the
house and responsible for the murder.
[27] Several questions came to mind. Did Justira, Nizam, the 1 st or
2 nd accused or someone else take the key of the vehicle? Did
Justira take and drove the vehicle from the house to the
waterfront? Did that mean that he was in or at the house at the
material time? Were Nizam bin Roslan and Noraini bte Kifflie

14



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

also in or at the house at that time? Did they work and stay at
the workers quarters? Did they know what happened in the
house at that time? Were they involved or complicit in the
murder or only in the theft of the vehicle or as accessories after
the fact? Or did one of the accused take the key, drove the
vehicle from the house and picked the others somewhere else?
Did the 1 st and 2 nd accused know how to drive? All these were
not raised or dealt with during the prosecution’s case, either by
the prosecution or the defence. The prosecution should but did
not clear these questions or doubts bearing in mind Nizam,
Noraini and Justira were the prosecution’s witnesses who could
give answers to the questions raised. To be cautious and to avoid
any adverse inference, the prosecution should have also called
the contractor to confirm whether the 1 st and 2 nd accused and or
whether Nizam and Justira were his workers and whether they
were staying at the workers quarters during the renovations. In
any event the burden was on the prosecution to prove its case
against the accused.
[28] Notwithstanding the above questions, what was the evidence
against the accused? PW1 testified that on 30.1.2015 at 9.00
p.m. he was sleeping in his bedroom in the house when the
deceased woke him up. He said the deceased told him two
workers had disturbed his car, namely the Toyota Prado, which
set off the car alarm and asked him whether he knew the phone
number of the contractor. He said he told the deceased he did
not know the phone number of the contractor. He said they had
these conversations at the dining room of the house.
[29] He said when he had the conversations with the deceased, he
saw two persons, without wearing shirt but wearing trousers,
entering the house through the backdoor of the house, walking
along the corridor, he used the words ‘walk path’, towards the
15

dining room, the person in front was holding a knife behind his
back and PW1 only saw the tip of the knife and the person
behind was holding a stick. He said he saw the two persons
because he was facing the back door and facing them when they
entered the house and therefore he shouted out that somebody
entered the house armed with a knife. He said the deceased was
surprised how they could enter the house since the backdoor was
locked. He said he ran into his bedroom and locked the bedroom
door but they knocked and pushed the door. He said he asked
them not to do that and he pushed a cabinet and table to block
the door. He heard the deceased shouting his name and he
escaped through the window of the bedroom. He went towards
the road to ask for help. A car stopped and took him to a police
station where he subsequently lodged his police report.
[30] During his testimony he was asked who were the two persons
had entered the house on that night, PW1 pointed to the two
accused sitting in the dock. He said he could identify them
because they were facing him when he saw them. He said the 2 nd
accused in the dock was the person walking in front armed with
the knife and the 1 st accused was armed with the stick. It should
be noted that although PW1 had seen them entering the house
armed with weapons, he did not actually see what happened to
the deceased or the murder. He last saw the deceased when they
were talking in the dining room in the house and when he ran
inside the bedroom at about 9.00 p.m. on that night.
[31] The evidence showed that after PW1 informed the police and the
family of the deceased, PW2 and his brother arrived at the house
about midnight, before PW1 and the police team arrived. They
found the body of their father on the floor of the kitchen in the
house. There were bloodstains splattered on the kitchen cabinet,
kitchen sink and the kitchen wall. The police found a sickle on a
16

sofa chair in the living room, a stick with nails on one end on
the floor near to the kitchen and a slipper. They also found a
green plastic bag containing a tin of glue, an L shape ruler and a
screwdriver on a bed in a bedroom. This was the bedroom of the
deceased. The police took swabs from these places in the house
and seized the items found. These were shown in the
photographs taken by PW3 at the crime scene. These
photographs were tendered as exhibit P6(1-73).
[32] As stated above, on 30.1.2015 at about 11.00 p.m., PW4
together with three other police personnel were on mobile patrol
at the main bazaar and waterfront area in Kuching where they
stopped the Toyota Prado vehicle. PW4 called it a Toyota
Pajero. The police brought the three men and a woman and the
vehicle to CPS. The four persons were detained for
investigation. PW4 identified the 1 st and 2 nd accused in court as
two of the four persons detained in the vehicle at the waterfront
on that night. The clothes worn by them on that night were kept
in the lockers at CPS and subsequently seized by the police. The
police also seized some clothes and a parang found inside the
vehicle. The police took swabs from inside and outside the
vehicle. All these items were sent to the Chemistry Department
for examination. The police also found one fingerprint on the
vehicle but could not identify this fingerprint when matched
with the police fingerprint database.
[33] The prosecution relied on the testimony of PW1that both
accused were responsible for the murder of the deceased based
on his identification of both accused as the two persons armed
with weapons who had entered the house on that night. The
prosecution submitted that based on the testimony of PW1, the
DNA obtained at the crime scene and based on the

17



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

circumstantial evidence adduced, both accused were responsible
for the murder and death of the deceased.
[34] I shall deal with the identification of both accused by PW1. The
defence submitted that PW1’s identification of both accused as
the two persons who had entered the house on that night was not
reliable and could not be correct because PW1 had poor eyesight
due to his old age, he had to wear glasses at night, that the
incident happened very fast and in poor lighting. It was
submitted that PW1 on seeing the two persons, at a distance of
about 30 feet, immediately ran away and he only had a fleeting
glance of the two persons. It was submitted that therefore he was
mistaken in identifying both accused as the two persons who had
entered the house on that night.
[35] As part of police investigation, the police carried out
identification parades for PW1 to identify some persons
suspected to be involved in the crime. The defence submitted
that the identification parades conducted did not comply with
standard procedures, were prejudicial and flawed because the
accused were in lock-up uniform, bare-footed and that the other
participants in the line-up were not members of the public but
persons detained in the lock-up who were suspects for other
crimes. It was submitted that these other participants were not of
the same race, skin colour and height of the accused and that
PW1’s identification of the accused should not be admissible
against them. However, these complaints or alleged
irregularities were not put to PW1 and that these had unduly
influenced or prejudiced his identification of both accused at the
identification parades. These alleged irregularities were also not
put to PW13. Both the prosecution and defence have cited
authorities in support of their submissions and I am aware of the

18



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

guidelines set out in R v. Turnbull [1976] ER 549 and in the case
of Duis Akim & Ors v. Public Prosecutor [2014] 1 MLJ 49.
[36] The evidence showed that on 4.2.2015 PW13 conducted six
identification parades at Tabuan Jaya police station for PW1 to
identify some persons suspected to be involved in the murder of
the deceased. There were three suspects to be identified by PW1.
There were ten participants including a suspect in each
identification parade. The other participants were detainees from
the lock-up at the police station. All the participants including
the suspects were in the lock-up uniform provided by the police
and all barefooted. Each suspect and the other participants in the
identification parade were brought to a room. PW1 was brought
to an adjoining room separated by a wall with a one way mirror
where he could see the participants in the line-up in the
identification parade in the adjoining room. He was asked to try
to identify a suspect, whom he had seen at the house on the
night of the incident, among the participants in the line-up via
the one way mirror. After the identification parades conducted,
PW13 prepared his report on the identifications carried out. This
report was tendered as exhibit P98.
[37] PW1 testified that in the first identification parade conducted,
he identified the 1 st accused standing in position no. 5 among
the participants as a person whom he had seen at the house. He
was asked to attend a second identification parade to confirm his
identification of this person. In the second identification parade
PW1 identified the 1 st accused in position no. 9 among the
participants.
[38] PW1 attended the next identification parade to identify another
suspect. In this identification parade he failed to identify any
person among the participants in the line-up. He was asked to

19



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

try to identify a suspect in the fourth identification parade.
Again he failed to identify any person in this identification
parade because he said none of the participants in these two
parades was seen at the house on that night. The evidence
showed that this suspect in the line-up whom he could not
identify was Nizam bin Roslan, who was one of the persons in
the Toyota Prado who was arrested at about 11.00 p.m. at the
waterfront on the night of the incident.
[39] PW1 attended the next identification parade to identify another
suspect. In this identification parade PW1 identified the 2 nd
accused standing in position no.10 among the participants as a
person whom he had seen at the house. He was asked to attend
the next identification parade to confirm his identification of the
same suspect. In this sixth identification parade PW1 identified
the 2 nd accused standing in position no. 3 among the
participants.
[40] Although the defence has submitted that PW1’s identification of
both accused was unreliable and not correct, counsel for both
the accused did not cross-examine PW1 on his identification of
both accused at the identification parades. It was never put to
him that his identifications of the 1 st and 2 nd accused at the
identification parades were flawed or wrong or mistaken for the
reasons as submitted. His testimony in these respects was not
seriously challenged. Similarly the defence did not strenuously
challenge the testimony of PW13 who conducted the
identification parades.
[41] PW1 said that he had to wear glasses at night when he was
driving. On that night, in the house, he was not driving and did
not require glasses when he saw and identified both accused as
the two persons who had entered the house on that night. Based

20



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

on the evidence adduced, PW1 was able to and had identified
both accused as the two persons armed with weapons who had
entered the house from the backdoor of the house on that night.
On that night it was not the first time that he had seen them. He
said he could identify them because he had seen them before. He
said they were the workers doing the renovations at the house.
[42] Based on the defence case, the 1 st and 2 nd accused persons were
staying in the workers quarters albeit it was submitted that they
were sleeping at the time. This was put to PW18 but it was not
put to PW1. It was not put to PW1 that Justira and Nizam were
also working and staying in the workers quarters at the house
and had entered the house on that night. It was never put to PW1
that he had seen them at the house. Similarly, during the
prosecution’s case, the prosecution did not lead any such
evidence of the presence of Justira, Nizam and Noraini in the
house or in the workers’ quarters.
[43] PW1 had stayed in the house for a few days to accompany the
deceased during the renovations. He had seen and recognised the
two accused who were working at the house for the past few
days. He identified the two accused as the two persons, armed
with weapons, who had entered the house from the backdoor on
that night. PW1 had identified both accused at the identification
parades as the two persons who had entered the house on that
night. He had also identified both accused in court as the two
persons who had entered the house on that night. Based on the
evidence, his identification of both accused was of good quality.
Therefore there were no merits that PW1 had wrongly identified
both accused as the two persons armed with weapons who had
entered the house on that night.

21



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

[44] Further, the evidence showed that although Nizam bin Roslan
was a suspect in the line-up in two of the identification parades,
PW1 did not identify Nizam bin Roslan as one of the two
persons who had entered the house on that night. That would
probably exclude him as one of the two persons who had entered
the house on that night. It was not put to the prosecution’s
witnesses and there was no evidence that Nizam bin Roslan and
or Justira bin Mohd Kuan were the two persons armed with the
weapons who had entered the house at that time or that they
were present in the house on that night. It was not put to PW1
that Nizam bin Roslan and Justira bin Mohd Kuan were some of
the workers doing the renovations at the house or that they had
stayed in the quarters at the house and that PW1 had seen them
at the house and therefore his identifications of the suspects
were flawed and mistaken. The evidence showed that the police
did not detect or find any bloodstain or DNA belonging to
Nizam bin Roslan, Noraini bte Kifflie or Justira bin Mohd Kuan
on the exhibits seized in the house at the material times and the
defence did not lead any evidence to the contrary.
[45] The prosecution has submitted that its case against the 1 st and
2nd accused did not wholly or substantially depend on the
identification evidence of PW1 against them, but also on the
DNA evidence and circumstantial evidence adduced. In such a
case, what has to be considered is not only the strength of each
individual strand of evidence but the combined strength of these
strands when twisted together to make a rope. The real question
is, is that rope strong enough to hang the prisoner? : see Chan
Chwen Kong v. Public Prosecutor [1962] 28 MLJ 307. What was
the circumstantial evidence against them?
[46] PW6 from the forensic unit of IPK Sarawak was at the crime
scene on the night of the incident. At the scene he recovered the
22



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

sickle which he labelled as E2 which was tendered as exhibit
P10, the stick with nails at one end was labelled as E3 and
tendered as exhibit P13, one slipper labelled as E4 (exhibit
P40B), one green plastic bag containing a tin ‘Rubber Cement’
labelled as E7 which were tendered as exhibits P43B and P43C
respectively, one screwdriver labelled as E8 (exhibit P44B), one
L shape ruler labelled as E9 (exhibit P45B) and several swabs
taken for DNA. PW6 handed these to PW18 as the IO. PW6
prepared his report on the items recovered and seized. The
report was tendered as exhibit P36.
[47] The evidence showed that PW8 collected head hair, nail
clippings, clothes and blood specimen from the deceased during
the post mortem to be sent to the Chemistry Department for
DNA, blood alcohol and drugs analysis. She handed the
specimen to PW18. The police had also collected blood
specimen from the 1 st and 2 nd accused and from Nizam bin
Roslan and Noraini bte Kifflie. I refer to exhibits P46A-D and
exhibits P47A-D. At the material time Justira had not been
arrested and his blood specimen was not taken.
[48] The evidence showed that PW11 led a police team to recover
and seize the vehicle, the clothes worn by the 1 st and 2 nd
accused, Nizam and Noraini and the clothes and the parang
found in the vehicle. They also took swabs from inside and
outside the vehicle for DNA analysis. The photographs of the
vehicle, the clothes kept in the lockers, the clothes and the
parang found in the vehicle and the places where the swabs were
taken are shown in the photographs taken by PW3 which were
tendered as exhibit P15 (1-28). PW11 prepared a sketch plan and
a report on the recovery of the items found in the vehicle. This
report was tendered as exhibit P84 and the sketch plan as exhibit
P85. PW11 handed over the items to PW18 who packed and sent
23



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

them to the Chemistry Department for analysis. These items
were tendered in court as exhibits P71A to P83B. Based on the
seizure list which was tendered as exhibit P92, PW11 seized the
vehicle and car key from the 2 nd accused. The vehicle was
tendered as exhibit P16.
[49] PW11 also seized the clothes worn by the 1 st and 2 nd accused
and the clothes worn by Nizam bin Roslan which were kept in
the lock-up lockers at CPS Kuching where they were detained
for investigation. The seizure lists were tendered as exhibits
P89, P90 and P91. A pair of blue trousers seized from the 2 nd
accused was tendered as exhibit P28C. The following items were
seized from the 1 st accused; a pair of knee length brown trousers
‘Snails’ brand with size ‘XXL’ which was tendered as exhibit
P29B, one short sleeve shirt ‘Pazze’ brand tendered as exhibit
P30B, a pair of brown shoes ‘Vogue’ brand tendered as exhibit
P31B and a brown belt with a ‘Batman’ buckle tendered as
P32B. The items seized from Nizam bin Roslan were tendered as
exhibits P33B, P34B and P35B respectively. PW11 handed over
these items to PW18.
[50] PW18 instructed PW15 to send all the items recovered or seized
during the investigation and the blood, urine and hair specimen
and nail clippings of the deceased to the Chemistry Department
for analysis. PW15 handed these items to a chemist (PW16) on
10.2.2015 who then handed them over to another chemist (PW9)
on 13.2.2015.
[51] The evidence showed that on an application by the police, PW7
took blood specimen from both the accused and from Nizam bin
Roslan and Noraini bte Kifflie. PW18 similarly instructed PW15
to send the blood specimen to the Chemistry Department for
analysis. On 10.2.2015 at 11.47 a.m. PW15 handed over the

24



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

specimen to a chemist (PW12) who carried out the analysis. She
prepared her report on the analysis carried out. This report was
tendered as exhibit P97. She testified that she did not detect any
ethyl alcohol or common basic drugs in the blood and urine
specimen.
[52] PW9 testified that on 13.2.2015 at 0800 hours, at the
Department of Chemistry Malaysia, Kuching, PW16, who was
taking leave for Chinese New Year, handed over to her the 42
items which consisted of two packages marked as “E3” and
“E32” and 40 envelopes marked as “E1”, “E2”, “E4”, “E5”,
“E6”, “E7”, “E8”, “E9”, “E10”, “E11”, “E12”, “E13”, “E16”,
“E17”, “E18”, “E19”, “E20”, “E21”, “E22”, “E23”, “E24”,
“E25”, “E26”, “E29”, “E30”, “E31”, “E33”, “E34”, “E35”,
“E36”, “E37”, “E38”, “E39”, “E40”, “E42”, “E43”, “E45”,
“E48” and “E49” respectively. She said PW16 told her that he
received these items from PW15 at 1201 hours on 10.2.2015.
[53] She said all the packages and envelopes were sealed as follows:
(a)

“E1” to “E9”: “FORENSIK POLIS DIRAJA MALAYSIA”
security tapes and “POLIS STATION 18 MILES” waxseal.

(b)

“E10” to “E26” and “E43” to “E49”: “POLIS STATION 18
MILES” wax seal.

(c)

“E29” to “E42”: “POLIS STATION 18 MILES” wax seal
and “FORENSIC” security tapes.

[54] PW9 testified that she carried out the analysis on these items
and she had prepared a report on her analysis. This report was
tendered as exhibit P69. I referred to some of the findings. She
said a DNA profile developed from bloodstains indicated on the

25



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

wooden stick (exhibit P13) with nails on one end labelled as
“E3” and on a pair of short pants labelled as “E20” (exhibit
P29B) matched with the DNA profile developed from the
bloodstained FTA card “E13” belonging to the deceased. This
meant that the blood of the deceased was found on the stick and
on the trousers worn by the 1 st accused on that night. This meant
that the 1 st accused and the deceased were in close proximity
when the deceased was attacked with the stick which caused the
deceased’s blood to be splattered onto the trousers worn by the
1 st accused on that night. However no bloodstain or DNA
belonging to the 1 st or 2 nd accused was detected on this stick.
[55] She said a DNA profile developed from bloodstains indicated on
the sickle labelled as “E2” (exhibit P10) revealed that it was a
mixed profile consistent with being contributed by one major
contributory source and at least one minor source. The source
represented by the bloodstained FTA card “E48” labelled Suffry
ak Empi, namely the 2 nd accused, was indicated as the major
contributory source. She said the source represented by the
bloodstained FTA card “E13” labelled Hii Nek Kah could not be
excluded as a minor contributory source of the DNA profile. She
said the probability of a randomly selected unrelated individual
with a DNA profile matching the profile of “E48” being a
contributor of this mixed profile is approximately 1 in 23.5
trillion as calculated based on the Malaysian Iban population
database. No bloodstain or DNA was detected on the handle of
the sickle.
[56] She said a partial DNA profile was developed from the swab
taken of a plastic bag labelled as “E7” (at 6 STR loci) consistent
with the DNA profile developed from bloodstained FTA card
“E48” labelled Suffry ak Empi, namely the 2 nd accused.

26



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

[57] She said weak and inconclusive DNA profiles were developed
from cotton swab “E29”, bloodstains indicated on cotton swabs
“E1”, “E6” and “E33” and swab taken from handle of sickle
“E2” and parang “E32”. The parang was found in the vehicle.
No evidence was adduced to whom it belonged. In any event no
bloodstain or DNA was found on the parang. No evidence was
adduced that it was used and the defence did not submit that it
was used in the attack on the deceased.
[58] As stated above, it was submitted that the trousers (exhibit
P29B) did not belong to the 1 st accused because it was too large
based on the trouser size ‘XXL’. It was submitted that since no
bloodstain belonging to the deceased was detected on the shirt
worn by the 1 st accused on that night, the bloodstain belonging
to the deceased detected on the trousers worn by him was
wrongfully smeared on the trousers by someone to implicate the
1 st accused.
[59] The evidence showed that on that night at about 11.00 p.m. the
police stopped the Toyota Prado and arrested the 1 st and 2 nd
accused, Nizam bin Roslan and Noraini bte Kifflie at the
waterfront. They were brought to CPS and detained in the lockup. The clothes worn by them on that night which were kept in
the lock-up lockers at CPS were seized and tendered as exhibits.
The seizures were recorded in exhibits P25, P26 and P27. There
was no evidence that there had been a mixed-up and there was
no evidence that the shirt, trousers, belt and shoes worn by the
1 st accused in fact belonged to the 2 nd accused or Nizam bin
Roslan. The defence did not lead any evidence and there was no
evidence that someone had replaced the trousers or had smeared
blood on the trousers in order to incriminate or harm the 1 st
accused. There were no merits in the submissions that the
trousers did not belong to the 1 st accused or that someone had
27



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

smeared blood belonging to the deceased on the trousers of the
1 st accused in order to incriminate the 1 st accused.
[60] Although PW9 was cross-examined, the defence did not
seriously cross-examine or challenge her evidence on her
examinations of the items, her analysis and findings. The
defence did not lead or introduce any report or evidence to the
contrary or that her examinations, analysis and findings were
seriously flawed or wrong or that her evidence should not be
accepted. There was nothing to suggest that her evidence was
inherently incredible or implausible or not admissible: see
Hanafi bin Mat Hassan v. Public Prosecutor [2006] 4 MLJ 134.
[61] The evidence showed that PW9 had examined a pair of short
pants labelled as E20 (exhibit P29B) bearing stains indicating
the presence of blood. On DNA profiles developed from
bloodstains on the stick (P13) and P29B, she found that they
matched with the DNA profile developed from the blood
specimen labelled as E13 (exhibit P61C) belonging to the
deceased. The bloodstains on the stick and on this pair of
trousers came from the deceased. PW1 had testified that the 1 st
accused entered the house armed with a stick on that night. The
presence of the deceased’s blood on the stick pointed to the fact
that it was used to attack the deceased on that night. The
presence of the deceased’s blood on the trousers worn by the 1 st
accused on that night pointed to the fact that the 1 st accused was
present and in close proximity to the deceased at the time of the
attack.
[62] This pair of trousers, with the bloodstains which came from the
deceased, was worn by the 1 st accused on that night when he was
detained by the police at the waterfront, about two hours after
the attack on the deceased in the house. They took and drove the

28



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

vehicle belonging to the deceased from the house where they
were stopped by the police at the waterfront. There was no
evidence that the deceased had injured himself and was bleeding
prior to or on that night or that he had accidentally come into
contact with the trousers of the 1 st accused on that night. The 1 st
accused did not submit that he accidently came into contact with
the deceased’s blood or that it was on another occasion and that
he had yet to wash his trousers. The presence of the deceased’s
blood on his trousers on that night irresistibly pointed to his
presence in the house on that night. This corroborated the
testimony of PW1 that the 1 st accused armed with the stick
entered the house on that night.
[63] The presence of the deceased’s blood on the stick and the
trousers irresistibly pointed to the fact that the 1 st accused had
used the stick to attack the deceased in the house on that night.
PW8 had testified that the lacerations at injury no. 6 and injury
no. 7 were consistent to be caused by blunt force trauma such as
being hit by a wood.
[64] PW9 had testified that she examined the sickle labelled as E2
and found bloodstain on it. The DNA profile developed revealed
that it was a mixed profile consistent being contributed by FTA
blood specimen labelled E48 (exhibit P53C) taken from the 2 nd
accused and from exhibit P61C from the deceased. The 2 nd
accused did not lead any evidence to the contrary. The presence
of the 2 nd accused DNA on the sickle found in the living room of
the house on that night pointed to his presence in the house on
that night.
[65] Further, PW9 found DNA belonging to the 2 nd accused on the
green plastic bag containing the tin of glue (exhibits P42B and
P42C), which were found on the bed in the deceased’s bedroom

29



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

in the house on that night. The 2 nd accused did not lead any
evidence to the contrary or that it was not his DNA on the
plastic bag. Although he said Dedeng came into the room and
took the green plastic bag and he saw the tin of glue in Dedeng’s
room, these were not put to the prosecution’s witnesses. He did
not put to the prosecution’s witnesses that he did not leave the
green plastic bag there or that he left the plastic bag containing
the tin on the bed on an earlier occasion and not on that night or
that someone else had put the green plastic bag with his DNA on
it on the bed to incriminate him. There was no evidence that
someone had put the green plastic bag with his DNA on it in the
bedroom to incriminate him. The absence of Dedeng’s DNA on
the green plastic bag and the tin of glue contradicted his
allegations. Without any plausible explanation, his DNA on the
plastic bag, in the bedroom, on that night, again pointed to his
presence in the house on that night.
[66] The presence of the DNA of the 2 nd accused on the sickle and on
the plastic bag found in two locations in the house on that night,
in the living room and in the deceased’s bedroom, irresistibly
pointed to his presence in the house on that night. This
corroborated the testimony of PW1 that he saw the 2 nd accused
armed with a knife entered the house from the backdoor of the
house on that night.
[67] The presence of the DNA of the 2 nd accused and the DNA of the
deceased on the sickle irresistibly pointed to the fact that the
sickle was used to attack the deceased on that night which
explained the presence of their DNA on the sickle. The sickle
was a sharp object. PW8 testified that the slashed wounds at
injuries no.6, no.8 and no.11 were consistent to be caused by a
sharp and heavy weapon.

[68] To reiterate, on the evidence adduced, on that night at about
9.00 p.m. the 1 st accused armed with the stick and the 2 nd
accused armed with the knife broke the backdoor and entered the
house from the backdoor approaching towards PW1 and the
deceased. PW1 ran into the bedroom and locked his bedroom
door. He heard the deceased calling out to him for help and he
escaped using the bedroom window to seek help. After he
returned to the house with the police, he saw the body of
deceased on the kitchen floor. Both the accused were no longer
in the house. They had left the house using the Toyota Prado
belonging to the deceased. They were stopped by the police at
the waterfront and detained at CPS. The stick and sickle were
found in the house. Their DNA and that of the deceased found
on the said exhibits irresistibly pointed to the fact they used the
stick and the sickle to attack the deceased in the house on that
night.
[69] Based on the multiple injuries sustained by the deceased, there
was an intention to cause death to the deceased. Based on
evidence adduced, no bloodstains or DNA belonging to Nizam,
Noriaini or Justira were found on the stick, sickle or green
plastic bag containing the tin of glue or inside the house. The
accused did not lead any evidence to the contrary. This would
exclude the presence of Nizam, Noraini and Justira inside the
house on that night where the deceased was attacked and killed.
This irresistibly pointed to the fact that it was the 1 st and 2 nd
accused who had mens rea and who had attacked and caused the
death of the deceased in the house.
[70] Following the above, it was the 1 st and 2 nd accused who had
ransacked the house, including the drawer in the deceased’s
bedroom with the cash and hand-phones missing. This was the
bedroom where the green plastic bag, with the DNA of the 2 nd
31



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

accused on it, containing the tin of glue, was found. These
pointed to the fact they had a motive to rob and attack the
deceased in the house on that night although the prosecution did
not lead evidence whether the cash and hand-phones were
recovered from the accused.
[71] In a criminal prosecution where s. 34 of the Penal Code is
invoked, it is not incumbent on the prosecution to prove that
there existed between the accused a common intention to
commit the crime actually committed. As long as there is a
common intention to commit a criminal act, which resulted in
the commission of a crime actually committed, s. 34 operates
against all the persons involved in the commission of the actual
crime: Farose Tamure Mohamad Khan v. PP & Other Appeals
[2016] 9 CLJ 769. A pre-concert or pre-planning may develop
on the spot or during the course of the commission of the
offence but the crucial test is that such a plan must precede the
act constituting the offence. The existence of common intention
is a question of fact: Wan Yurillhami Wan Yaacob & Anor v. PP
[2010] 1 CLJ 17; see also Low Kian Boon & Anor v. PP [2010] 5
CLJ 489. Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, there
was a pre-concert or pre-planning or meeting of minds between
the 1 st and 2 nd accused to rob and attack the deceased which
caused the death of the deceased.
[72] On evidence adduced, the prosecution has proved the essential
ingredients of the charge under s. 302 read together with s. 34 of
the Penal Code and has made out a prima facie case against the
1 st and 2 nd accused. They had been called to enter their defence.
[73] At the close of the defence case, the prosecution applied under
section 425 of CPC to call Justira otherwise known as Dedeng as
a rebuttal witness. During the defence case the accused put the

32



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

blames onto Dedeng saying that (i) Dedeng was sniffing glue,
(ii) Dedeng tried to enter the house, (iii) the accused were
sleeping when Dedeng woke them up, and (iv) the key of the
Toyota Prado was with Dedeng. The prosecution submitted that
this evidence was not disclosed to the prosecution and not
foreseeable. The prosecution submitted that therefore it was
essential to the just decision of the case to call Dedeng to rebut
this evidence.
[74] Based on the prosecution’s witness list, Nizam, Noraini and
Dedeng were on the witness list. The prosecution chose not to
call them and submitted that they were not present in the house
but were only found inside the car when it was stopped at the
waterfront. The learned DPP submitted that they were only
involved in the theft of the car and only accomplices in the theft
of the car. He submitted that pursuant to s. 114(b) of Evidence
Act, they were unworthy of credit and there was no reason to
call them as witnesses.
[75] Dedeng was not called as a prosecution witness but was offered
to the defence. The defence also chose not to call him. He was
not recalled as a witness under section 138(4) of the Evidence
Act. The defence called the 1 st and 2 nd accused as their only
witnesses.
[76] Although s. 425 of CPC gives to the Court discretion to call a
witness at any stage of the trial in rebuttal, this is only in very
special or exceptional circumstances. This power should be
exercised only in rare cases, for instance where one side has
raised at the trial a point which the other side could not have
foreseen. This discretion must be exercised with the utmost
caution and that this person appears to the Court essential to the
just decision of the case: see Balfour v. Public Prosecutor

[1949] Supp MLJ 8; Public Prosecutor v. Abdul Hamid [1969] 1
MLJ 53; Public Prosecutor v. Chia Leong Foo [2000] 6 MLJ
705; Shahrullah bin Abdul Rakeb v. Public Prosecutor [2012] 4
MLJ 592.
[77] The case of Chia Leong Foo (supra) referred to several
authorities including Woolmington v. DPP [1935] AC 462 and R
v. Killick [1980] 24 SASR 137 which set out the followings: (i)
The general rule is that the prosecution must present its primary
case completely before closing its case. This will include
negating the case for the defence as suggested to each witness in
cross-examination. (ii) A failure to observe this rule will result
in the prosecution being precluded from adducing evidence in
rebuttal on the ground that it would amount to the prosecution
splitting its case. (iii) However there is a discretion to allow
evidence in rebuttal in very special or exceptional
circumstances. (iv) In exercising this discretion the Court must
have regard to all the circumstances of the case and evaluate
whether the prosecution is attempting to improve on something
it has already begun or whether it is seeking to refute something
that can reasonably be characterised as fresh material contained
in the defence case.
[78] On the first point, of Dedeng sniffing glue, the prosecution has
produced and tendered the green plastic bag containing the tin of
glue found in the bedroom of the deceased. Based on the DNA
evidence adduced and cross-examination of the accused by the
DPP, it was apparent that Dedeng was one of the workers at the
house. Therefore Dedeng being a prosecution witness, whether
he or Nizam was a glue sniffer should be within the knowledge
of the prosecution based on their interview or interrogation by
the police. Therefore this is foreseeable and should have been

34



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

put to Dedeng or Nizam or PW18 (the IO of the case) to negate
this point during the prosecution’s case.
[79] On the second point that Dedeng tried to enter the house, based
on the prosecution’s submission, at the end of its case, that he
was not present in the house but was found inside the car when
the car was stopped by the police at the waterfront and that he
and Nizam were accomplices in the theft of the car. Therefore
there was no necessity to rebut this issue bearing in mind the
submission of the prosecution that there was no bloodstain or
DNA of Dedeng or Nizam or Noraini found in the house on that
night and PW1 has testified that the 1 st and 2 nd accused were the
two persons who entered the house on that night.
[80] On the third and fourth points, that both accused were sleeping
when Dedeng woke them up and Dedeng had the key of the car,
these are issues of fact to be determined at the end of the trial,
bearing in mind that it was not put to the prosecution’s
witnesses except to PW18 that Dedeng had possession of the key
when he woke them up. These would also go to the credibility
and defence of the 1 st and 2 nd accused and the weight to be
given. Therefore there was no necessity to call Dedeng to rebut
these bearing in mind that Dedeng was a prosecution’s witness
but chose not to call him.
[81] Where the evidence sought to be introduced in rebuttal is itself
evidence probative of the guilt of an accused and where it is
reasonably foreseeable by the prosecution that some gaps in the
prove of guilt needs to be filled by evidence called by the
prosecution, then generally speaking the Court is likely to rule
against the closing any such gap by rebuttal evidence: see R v.
Miliken [1969] 53 Cr App R 330.The prosecution must be bound
by their own submission i.e. that Dedeng would be unworthy of

35



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

credit. If that was the case what was the point of calling him as
a rebuttal witness if he was unworthy of credit. For the reasons
given, the application to call Dedeng as a rebuttal witness was
not granted.
[82] In a criminal trial the onus of proving the guilt of an accused
person beyond reasonable doubt, which never shifts, lies
throughout on the prosecution. The burden is not on the accused
persons to prove their innocence but merely to offer an
explanation which may reasonably be true or which raises a
reasonable doubt as to their guilt: see Saminathan & Ors v.
Public Prosecutor [1955] 21 MLJ 121; Public Prosecutor v.
Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris & Ors [1977] 1 MLJ 180. In
considering the defence the court is guided by the principles set
out in the case of Mat v. Public Prosecutor [1963] 1 MLJ 263.
[83] The 1 st accused testified under oath. He said his friend Dedeng,
who was from Bako, introduced and brought him to the house to
work as a brick-layer. Dedeng and Nizam had been working at
the house before him. He started work at the house three days
before the incident at the house. He said he and the 2 nd accused
started work at the house on the same day. He said there were
altogether eight workers at the house. He wore a straw hat
because it was hot and he was facing the wall when he was
laying the bricks, therefore no one could see his face. He was
asked and he said during his three days working at the house he
had never seen PW1 at the house. He was asked and he said he
was not in the habit of glue sniffing or drinking liquor.
[84] In view of the distance from the house to the city, he was
provided a place to stay at a room, which was to be the hostel of
the home-stay, which was being built. He shared the room with
the 2 nd accused and Nizam. He said Dedeng stayed in the next

36



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

room with his wife Noraini and their ten years old son. The
other four workers did not stay in the house.
[85] The 1 st accused said on 30.1.2015 he was working but they
worked half-day until 12.30 noon on that day. In the afternoon
they went to a shop which was about half an hour’s walking
distance from the house to buy foods such as chicken, eggs and
packet noodle which were put inside a green plastic bag (exhibit
P43B) which was carried by the 2 nd accused. He said he was
wearing a black t-shirt and blue jeans. He was asked and he
changed his answer that it was a yellow checked shirt. They
returned to the house at 5.30 p.m. They had dinner around 7.00
to 8.00 p.m. After that he relaxed in his room and went to sleep.
[86] He was shown exhibit P29B and he said the trousers did not
belong to him. He was shown exhibit P30B and he said the shirt
belonged to him. He said the blue jeans were not seized by the
police on that night and he did not know what happened to the
blue jeans.
[87] The 1 st accused said when he was about to go to sleep, Dedeng
came to his room and he heard the sound of a plastic bag taken
out of the room. One hour later, Dedeng woke the three of them
and asked them to go to a vehicle which they followed. He said
he did not ask Dedeng why he asked them to go to the vehicle.
He said Dedeng drove the vehicle and he was seated next to
Dedeng. Nizam, the 2 nd accused, Noriani and the child were in
the back passenger seats. He said they did not know what
happened that night but on the way to town they were stopped
by the police. He then said Dedeng saw a van that looked like a
police van in the rear mirror of the vehicle and Dedeng suddenly
stopped the vehicle and ran away. He said they were arrested
and charged for murder.

37



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

[88] He was asked and he said Dedeng looked frightened and nervous
when he woke them up. He said he did not know whose vehicle
was that and he did not have a driving licence. He was asked and
he said he could not drive.
[89] He denied that he and the 2 nd accused were the two persons
without shirt and carrying weapons who had entered the house
on that night. He was shown the stick (exhibit P13) and he said
he had never seen it and he did not bring a piece of wood as
alleged against him. He was asked and he said he did not
together with the 2 nd accused plan to enter the house of the
deceased on that night and did not plan to attack the deceased.
[90] The 1 st accused also said that during the identification parades a
police officer asked him to come nearer to the one-way mirror
so that PW1 could see him and he also saw PW1 on the other
side of the one-way mirror. He said PW1 could not identify him
on both occasions during the identification parades. He said on
the third time PW1 still could not identify him and the police
pointed him to PW1 that this was the one and PW1 nodded his
head. He then said PW1 did not come to testify in court.
[91] The 2 nd accused also testified under oath. He followed his
employer known as Ah Mew, the subcontractor of the deceased,
who brought him to work as a labourer laying bricks at the
house of the deceased. He was on daily pay at RM85.00, but
paid at the end of each month. He said that he wore a straw hat,
facing the wall, while laying bricks and plastering the wall so
that people could not see his face. He said all the other workers
wore a hat, but different types. He, the 1 st accused, Nizam,
Dedeng and his family stayed at the rooms provided which were
outside the house. The other workers did not stay at the house
and followed Ah Mew back each day.

38



[2017] 1 LNS 783

[92] He was asked and he said on 28 th , 29 th and 30 th of January, 2015
while he was working at the house he did not meet face to face
with PW1 and he said if PW1 was at the work site, PW1 could
not see his face clearly, even during lunch breaks when he was
not wearing his hat. He said he had never seen PW1 and PW1
never entered the rooms where they slept. He was asked and he
said he did not sniff glue but he drank a little bit of alcohol to
ease his tiredness.
[93] The 2 nd accused said on 30.1.2015 they worked half day. That
night they wanted to have a barbeque and they went to a shop at
Telaga Air to buy chicken, noodles, eggs and biscuit. The
chicken was put in white plastic bag and the eggs, noodles and
biscuit were put in a green plastic bag. He carried both plastic
bags. At the house he put both plastic bags in Dedeng’s room,
Dedeng’s wife kept the white plastic bag whereas Dedeng took
the green plastic bag. Subsequently he said he brought the green
plastic bag to their room because the 1 st accused wanted to eat
the noodle. He said later Dedeng came into the room. He did not
know what he was doing in their room but he heard the sound of
plastic bag being brought with him from their room. He was
shown a green plastic bag (exhibit P43B) and he said it looked
similar to the green plastic bag. He said he did not know what
happened to the green plastic bag.
[94] He was asked by his counsel whether he was aware of any
person having the habit of sniffling glue in the two rooms and he
said he had personal knowledge and he named the 1 st accused as
the glue sniffer. He was asked and he said he never found any
tin of glue in the two rooms but the 1 st accused brought the glue
during working hours. Later in his evidence, he was shown a tin
(exhibit P43C) and he said he had seen it in Dedeng’s room. The
next day, towards the end of his evidence-in-chief, he said he
39



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

wished to amend his testimony that the 1 st accused was a glue
sniffer. He said he never saw the 1 st accused sniffing glue. He
was also asked whether Dedeng was a glue sniffer and he said
“Yes, he is a glue sniffer.”
[95] He said he helped to cut the wood by using a sickle (exhibit
P10) for the barbeque. While he was cutting the wood he
mistakenly cut his finger. He was asked how much blood and he
said just a little. Then he left the sickle in Dedeng’s room. After
the barbeque, at 8.00 p.m., he went to bed because he was tired.
Although it was put to PW18 that the sickle originated from the
workers quarters which was used for cutting vegetables,
chopping meat and chicken etc., it was not put that the 2 nd
accused had used the sickle to cut the wood and cut his finger
which explained his DNA on the sickle.
[96] When he was sleeping Dedeng woke them up and asked them to
run away. He said Dedeng looked scared. He did not know why
he asked them to run away. Dedeng asked them to follow him to
the car. Dedeng had the car key, he did not know where he took
the key from. They all entered the car and Dedeng drove the car
towards the waterfront where he stopped to buy a drink. When
Dedeng was about to enter the car he saw a police car came and
he ran away. He said Nizam also ran away but the police caught
him. He did not know why the police detained the car.
[97] He was asked and he said he did not enter the house of the
deceased on that night. He said he did not bring the sickle into
the house of the deceased on that night. He said he had no
motive and common intention to enter the house of the deceased
on that night. He denied the allegation made by PW1 that he
together with the 1 st accused attacked the deceased on that night.

40



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

He was also asked and he said PW1 could not identify him
during the identification parades.
[98] The 1 st and 2 nd accused gave similar evidence, albeit there were
inconsistencies and contradictions. The 1 st and 2 nd accused
denied that they were the two persons, without shirt, armed with
the stick and sickle, who had entered the house of the deceased
at about 9.00 p.m. on that night. They put the blame for the
murder on Dedeng because they said Dedeng woke them up
asking them to run away and to follow him into the Toyota
Prado. They alleged that Dedeng had the car key who drove the
car to the waterfront where they were stopped by the police and
arrested except Dedeng who ran away. They said Dedeng took
the green plastic bag from their room. The 2 nd accused said after
he cut the wood for the barbeque, he left the sickle in Dedeng’s
room. He said he saw the tin of glue in Dedeng’s room and that
Dedeng was a glue sniffer. They contended that it was Dedeng
who had the sickle who entered the house and attacked the
deceased with it and left the green plastic bag with the tin of
glue inside the bedroom of the deceased. They submitted that
the fact that Dedeng had run away when he saw the police
indicated his guilt in the murder. They did not put any blame on
Nizam although he was in the Toyota Prado who also ran away
but was apprehended by the police.
[99] What they had said about Dedeng’s involvement in the murder
was not put to the prosecution’s witnesses except to PW18 who
was the investigating officer. Their allegations that PW1 was
never at the house, that he could not identify them at the
identification parades and that they were pointed out to PW1 by
the police were not put to PW1, PW13 or PW18 notwithstanding
that PW1, who was not seriously challenged in his testimony,
had testified and identified both accused as the two persons who
41



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

had entered the house on that night. PW1’s testimony as such
has been corroborated by the DNA evidence. These not only
raised serious doubts on their credibility but also their defence.
There is a general rule that failure to cross-examine a witness on
a crucial part of the case will amount to an acceptance of the
witness’s testimony: Wong Swee Chin v. Public Prosecutor
[1981] 2 MLJ 212.
[100] Initially the 2 nd accused said that he never saw any tin of glue in
the two rooms where they slept but he knew the 1 st accused was
a glue sniffer because the 1 st accused brought the glue during
working hours. But he contradicted himself when he later said
that he had seen the tin of glue (exhibit P43C) in Dedeng’s
room. He then changed his evidence to say that he never saw the
1 st accused sniffing glue but that Dedeng was a glue sniffer.
These contradictions were not explained by the defence.
[101] PW1’s testimony that two persons, one armed with a knife and
the other with a stick, who had entered the house from the
backdoor of the house was never challenged. They only
challenged PW1’s identification of the two persons. I have dealt
with the identification. Although they alleged it was Dedeng
who entered the house and left the sickle in the house, there was
no explanation who was the other person who entered the house
armed with the stick and left it there as the defence alleged. The
defence did not adduce any evidence that someone had put the
sickle, stick and the green plastic bag containing the tin of glue
in the house after both accused had left the house in the vehicle.
The evidence showed that no DNA of Dedeng, Nizam and
Noraini were found on the sickle, stick, green plastic bag or tin
of glue or in the house from police investigation carried out on
that night. In particular, no DNA of Dedeng was found on the
sickle, stick or green plastic bag containing the tin of glue. The
42



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

DNA evidence excluded the presence of Dedeng, Nizam or
Noraini in the house or their involvement in the murder. The
defence did not introduce any evidence to the contrary. The
DNA evidence contradicted their assertions that Dedeng entered
the house, used the sickle and or the stick to attack the deceased
and left the sickle, the stick and the green plastic bag in the
house and fled from the scene by taking the car key of the
deceased from inside the house and drove the deceased’s vehicle
from the house.
[102] On the contrary, the DNA evidence showed that the 1 st and 2 nd
accused were in the house on that night. The DNA of the
deceased was detected on the stick which was used to attack the
deceased which was found in the house. The DNA profile
developed from the bloodstain found on 1 st accused trousers
worn by the 1 st accused on that night was from the deceased.
The DNA of the 2 nd accused was found on the sickle which was
used to attack the deceased bearing in mind that Dedeng’s DNA
was not found on the sickle. The DNA of the 2 nd accused found
on the green plastic bag contradicted his evidence about the
green plastic bag and the tin of glue and who was a glue sniffer,
again bearing in mind that Dedeng’s DNA was not found on the
green plastic bag or on the tin of glue. The DNA evidence not
only contradicted their defence but found them to be lying.
[103] Although both accused said they did not know how to drive and
that it was Dedeng who drove the vehicle, on the evidence
adduced that Dedeng’s DNA was not found on the weapons or
on the green plastic bag or in the house and that the accused had
disturbed the Toyota Prado which set off the car alarm prior to
their entry into the house, the inferences reasonably drawn
pointed to the fact that after they had attacked the deceased,
they took the car key from the house, woke up Dedeng, Nizam
43



[2017] 1 LNS 783

Legal Network Series

and Noraini and asked them to run and asking Dedeng to drive
the vehicle. Based on the seizure list (exhibit P92), the vehicle
and car key were seized from the 2 nd accused. The defence did
not challenge exhibit P92. These contradicted their allegations
that Dedend took the car key or had the car key when he woke
them up.
[104] On the evidence adduced, and on a balance of probabilities, the
defence raised by the accused could not be true and has also
failed to raise a doubt as to their guilt.
[105] At the conclusion of the trial, on the totality of the evidence
adduced, the prosecution has proved its case against each of the
two accused beyond reasonable doubt: see s. 182A of CPC.
[106] I find each accused guilty and convict each of them of the
offence under s. 302 of the Penal Code read together with s. 34
of the Penal Code as per the charge made against them.
[107] Upon the conviction recorded, pursuant to s. 302 of the Penal
Code and s. 277 of CPC, the 1 st and 2 nd accused shall be
punished with death. Each accused shall be hanged by the neck
till he is dead.
