PETITION OF APPEAL
[6]

In the Petition of Appeal filed by the Appellant, there are six
grounds as against the conviction in respect of the above three
amended charges. As against sentence, there are three grounds.

WHETHER THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN LAW
AND FACT WHEN HE HELD THAT THE RESPONDENT HAS
PROVED THE INGREDIENTS UNDER SECTION 17(A) MACC
ACT 2009 AND THE PRESUMPTION IS TRIGGERED AGAINST
THE APPELLANT?
[7]

Section 17(a) MACC Act 2009 dealt with an offence committed
by an agent and Section 3 MACC Act 2009 defines the word
“agent”. In the present appeal, the Appellant is a government
servant. Since December 2005, he is an officer of Polis Di-Raja
Malaysia and the Appellant’s service record (Exhibit P27 (2))
which was kept by PW2, DSP Nur Ashyikin Bt Abdullah who is
in charge of the police personnel service records and human
resource of IPK Sarawak testified that the Appellant was a
police personnel at the material times, that is on the 24 th August
2014, 11 th September 2014 and 20 th October 2014 as per the 3
amended charges.

[8]

The Privy Council in the case of PP v. Yuvaraj [1969] 2 MLJ 89
at pages 90-91 held inter alia as follows:“where a defendant is charged with an offence under
section 4(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961, to
which section 14 also applied, the onus lies upon the

5



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

prosecution to prove the first two factual ingredients of
the offence viz. (1) that a gratification was paid or given
to or received by the defendant and (2) that at the time of
the payment, gift or receipt he was in the employment of
a public body. Upon proof of these two ingredients the
existence of the third ingredient, viz. (3) that the
gratification was paid or given or received corruptly as
an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do an
act in relation to the affairs of that public body, is to be
presumed “unless the contrary is proved”.
(Emphasis is mine)
[9]

Section 4(a) Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 is in pari
materia with section 17(a) MACC Act 2009. To prove the said
three amended charges under section 17(a) MACC Act 2009
against the Appellant, the Respondent needed to prove the
following ingredients:(i)

The Appellant
Ingredient)

had

accepted

gratification;

(First

(ii)

At the time the gratification obtained, the Appellant was
an agent i.e. an officer of PDRM; (Second Ingredient)

(iii) Upon proof of these two above ingredients, then the third
ingredient arise, that is the gratification was accepted by
the Appellant corruptly as an inducement for forbearing to
do an act in relation to his principal‟s affairs, to wit, for
giving protection to PW1, who was allegedly has
committed an offence of illegal timber logging activities at
Sungai Sut, Kapit. Thus the Appellant shall be presumed
that he has accepted the gratification corruptly as stated
under section 50(1) MACC Act 2009 unless the contrary

6



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

proven in respect of the said three amended charges.
(Third Ingredient)
FIRST INGREDIENT IN RESPECT OF THE THREE AMENDED
CHARGES
[10] (1) In so far as the First Ingredient is concerned, this Court
finds that the Appellant had at 3.40pm on 24/8/2014, accepted
RM3,000.00, a gratification ie, money from PW1 (as per the
First Amended Charge), the Appellant had at 11.58am on
11/9/2014 accepted RM5,000.00, a gratification ie, money from
PW1 through the Maybank account of Fitero Bin Rafi’ee (as per
the Second amended Charge) and the Appellant had at 10.25am
on 20/10/2014, accepted RM8,000.00 a gratification ie, money
from PW1 (as per the Third amended Charge).
FIRST AMENDED CHARGE
(2) On 24/8/2014, at 3pm, PW1 went together with PW3 to
Tekam café, Kapit to meet the Appellant. The scene of the
meeting is shown in the photograph (P3 (1-4)). PW1 and PW3
arrived at Tekam Café first and they were seated at the table
whereby the position of PW1 is marked as “S”, and the position
of PW3 is marked as “D” as in photographs P3 (3 & 4).
(3) During the said meeting, the Appellant introduced himself
as Assistant Superintendent of IPD Kapit (ASP Nazri), whereas
PW1 disguised himself as “Jimmy”, an illegal timber logger.
The Appellant informed PW1 that he can give protection for the
illegal timber logging activity carried out by PW1, but PW1
must pay the Appellant when there is extraction of timber by
PW1 from Sungai Sut, Kapit. The Appellant then asked PW1 as
follows, “Bagaimana dengan pembayarannya?” since PW1 wants

7



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

to “operate” at Sungai Sut, Kapit. PW1 replied that he can pay
RM3,000.00 to the Appellant and the Appellant said “Ok”. PW1
then took out the RM3,000.00 and passed it to the Appellant
over the table. PW1 then asked the Appellant to count the said
money. The Appellant accepted the said money without any sign
of rejection or refusal. The Appellant told PW1 not to worry
because he will inform PW1 when and if there is any operation
conducted by the police.
(4) PW3 witnessed and heard the above meeting between PW1
and the Appellant. The conversation which transpired between
PW1 and the Appellant was recorded in audio-video recording
device (P4). After that, PW7 handed the said audio-video
recording device (P4) to PW1 for the purpose of recording
inspection and the said audio-video recording device (P4) was
kept by PW10 before it was handed to PW11 as an exhibit. The
recording on the incident dated 24/8/2014 (P4) and the transcript
(P5) showed clearly that there was a demand and acceptance of
RM3,000.00 by the Appellant from PW1 in order to give
protection for PW1’s illegal timber logging activities at Sungai
Sut, Kapit. The transcript (P5) showed the solicitation of corrupt
money by the Appellant and the protection given by the
Appellant if PW1 carry out illegal timber logging activities at
Sungai Sut, Kapit,
(5) The Appellant then left Tekam Café and then followed by
PW1 and PW3. PW1 lodged a report relating to the incident at
Tekam Café on 24/8/2014 which is marked as Borang Aduan
SPRM No: 255/2014 dated 27/8/2014 (P6). On 9/9/2014, PW1
received several text messages from the handphone no:
0198196900 which was used by the Appellant. The said text
messages from the Appellant to PW1 clearly showed that the

8



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

Appellant’s corrupt mind to solicit money from PW1. The said
text messages are shown in the Forensic Report (P7).
(6) The Forensic Report (P8) is the forensic analysis
pertaining to the handphone no: 0198196900 which was used by
the Appellant and the SIM card as well and they corroborated
Exhibit P7 in that the same content of the text messages as
abovesaid is shown in Lampiran 2.2, page 16-17 of P8.
SECOND AMENDED CHARGE
(7) On 11/9/2014, PW1 informed his superior, Tuan Zacharias
Kho about the solicitation of the Appellant via SMS dated
9/9/2014, who then asked PW10 to prepare RM5,000.00 as per
Senarai Wang Bertanda (P10) and PW10 passed the RM5,000.00
to PW1. PW10 also recorded a tele-conversation between PW1
and the Appellant in order to confirm that there was indeed a
solicitation of RM5,000 from the Appellant as shown in the said
SMS. The said tele-conversation on 11/9/2014 between the
Appellant and PW1 (P9) was recorded by PW10 and the content
of the said conversation is reflected in the transcript (P9(1)).
The transcript (P9(1)) clearly showed that the Appellant
confirmed that Maybank Account no: 161097026746 under the
name of Fitero bin Rafiee via SMS to PW1, is correct and asked
PW1 to bank in RM5,000.00 into this bank account. PW1 told
the Appellant that he will inform the Appellant via SMS after
PW1 banked in RM5,000.00 into the said bank account.
(8) PW1 deposited RM5,000.00 into the said bank account
immediately after the abovesaid telephone-conversation which
was recorded by PW10. The proof of deposit of RM5,000.00
into the said bank account is stated in the Bank-in Slip (P11).
There were several text messages between PW1 and the

9



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

Appellant after the deposit of the RM5,000.00 into the said bank
account on 11/9/2014 as shown in the Forensic Report (P7)
which is the forensic analysis of handphone no: 0146841617 and
the SIM card which were used by PW1.
(9) PW1 then lodged another report pertaining to the deposit
of RM5,000.00 into Maybank Account no: 161097026746 under
the name of Fitero bin Rafiee as requested by the Appellant on
11/9/2014. The said report is Borang Aduan SPRM No:
279/2014 dated 12/9/2014 (P12).
(10) On 23/9/2014, PW1 received a text message from the
Appellant, requesting him to call him urgently. The said text
message is shown in lampiran C, page 15 of P7 and page 15 of
P8. The telephone conversation between PW1 and the Appellant
was recorded by PW11 and the content of the said conversation
is reflected in the transcript (P13 (1)). The transcript (P13 (1))
clearly showed that the Appellant asked PW1 not to carry out
any timber logging activities at Kapit because MACC has joint
operation with Forestry department at Kapit by 24/9/2014.
(11) On 2/10/2014, PW1 received another text message from
the Appellant requesting him call him urgently. The said text
message is shown in lampiran C, at page 15 of P7. The
telephone conversation between PW1 and the Appellant was
recorded by PW10 and the content of the said conversation is
reflected in the transcript (P14 (1)). The transcript (P14 (1))
clearly showed that the Appellant asked PW1 to find out
whereabouts of PW3 since PW3 is untraceable by the Appellant.
The Appellant would like to know whether PW3 has sold the
timber which was extracted out from Sungai Sut, Kapit and the
Appellant wanted his entitlement to the portion of payment if

10



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

the timber was sold by PW3 is agreed by both parties at Tekam
Café on 24/8/14.
(12) On the same day, several text messages were exchanged
between PW1 and the Appellant and the said text messages are
shown in the Forensic Report (P7) which is the forensic analysis
pertaining to the handphone no: 0146841617 and the SIM card
which were used by PW1.
(13) On 14/10/2014, several text messages were exchanged
between PW1 and the Appellant and the said text messages are
shown in the Forensic Report (P7) which is the forensic analysis
pertaining to the handphone no: 0146841617 which was used by
PW1 and the SIM card used by PW1.
THIRD AMENDED CHARGE
(14) PW1 informed Tuan Zacharias Kho about the request of
the Appellant via the said SMSes dated 14/10/2014 and
16/10/2014 respectively who then decided to set up an
entrapment of the Appellant on 20/10/2014. On 19/10/2014,
PW1 went to Sibu and attended a briefing which was chaired by
Mr Fadlyzal Mohd Zain. The other MACC officers who attended
the said briefing were Omar Mokhtar Bin Jahari, Abdul Hakim
Bin Saadan, Affiq Bin Aziz, Jawa Ak Milu and Harmawan Bin
Waren. The said briefing was about the entrapment of the
Appellant which would be carried out at the River Front Café of
Kingwood Hotel on 20/10/2014 between 10am to 11am. PW1
will take off his spectacles as a signal to the other MACC
officers who will be waiting at the vicinity of the said Café
when the trap money of RM8000.00 is handed to the Appellant.
Besides that, PW1 was given RM8,000.00 (P15 (1)) as per the
Senarai Wang Bertanda (P15). An audio-video recording device

11



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

(P18) was given by PW9, Mr. Jackson Ak Gikian to PW1 in
order to capture the incident that will transpire at the River
Front Café of Kingwood Hotel on 20/10/2014. Prior to that,
PW9 and PW1 checked to ensure that the said audio-visual
recorder was in good working condition.
(15) On 19/10/2014, several text messages were exchanged
between PW1 and the Appellant and they are shown in the said
Forensic Report (P8). The said text messages showed inter alia
showed that the Appellant confirmed with PW1 regarding the
meeting at River Front Café of Kingwood Hotel on 20/10/2014
at 10.30am.
(16) Prior to that meeting, PW1 was equipped with the audiovisual recorder that given by PW9. On 20/10/2014, at about
10am at River Front Café of Kingwood Hotel, PW1 met the
Appellant for the second time and PW7 brought RM8,000.00
(P15(1)) to the said café, and sat at table which is shown in
photograph P16(6) and waited for the Appellant. Before the
arrival of PW1, the other MACC officers namely PW6,
Harmawan Bin Waren and Mr Anthonio James took the positions
at the table which marked as “HA”, “HE” and “AN” respectively
as shown in photograph P16(7).
(17) PW1 then sent a text message to the Appellant and
informed the Appellant that he has arrived at the said café. The
Appellant arrived at the said café, 5 to 10 minutes after the
arrival of PW1 and sat next to PW1.
The Appellant also brought a “Swee Gear” bag which is black in
colour (P17) with him when he arrived at the said café. During
the meeting, PW1 informed the Appellant that he brought the
RM8000.00 and the Appellant told PW1 that he was alright with
that. When PW1 asked the Appellant that whether he want him
12



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

to put the said trap money inside the said bag (P17), the
Appellant instructed PW1 to put the said trap money into his bag
(P17). PW1 did as requested by the Appellant and then took off
his glasses as signal to PW6 and the other MACC officers. The
meeting and conversation which transpired between PW1 and
the Appellant was recorded in the audio-video recording device
(P18). The transcript (P18(1) as per said audio-video recording
(P18) showed the acceptance of the said trap money by the
Appellant and the protection which could be given by the
Appellant if PW1 carry out illegal timber logging activities at
Sungai Sut, Kapit.
(18) This Court is guided by the case of PP v. Jamil Bin
Mahmod & Anor [1998] 4 MLJ 681 where the court held at page
682 as follows:
“since the respondent solicited the gratification, the
acceptance of the trap money could not have been
inadvertent. The respondent had knowingly accepted the
money and there was cogent evidence that the money was
intended as a gratification or reward for not issuing the
summons...”
(19) Further in the case of Mohamed Mokhtar v. PP [1972] 1
MLJ 122, the court at page 123 held inter alia as follows:
“The act of handing over of the currency notes in the
envelope was seen by P.W 14 and P.W 15 (P.W 14 and P.W
15 testified that they saw P.W 12 handing over that
envelope to the appellant). I do not know what is
corroboration if that is not corroboration. The money was
not only handed over to the appellant but also found with
the appellant before he was finally arrested. In the case of

13



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

Ramly Md. Yasin & Ors v. PP [1982] CLJ (Rep) 724 at
page 725:“[2] The discoveries of the marked notes from each
of the appellants are independent corroborative
evidence which led to one and only irresistible
conclusion that the appellants received the money
from PW12. The presumption under s. 14 of the Act
that the gratification is deemed to have been given
and received by the appellants corruptly as an
inducement or reward, arises.”
(20) In the light of this Court’s findings, this Court finds that
the Respondent had proved the First Ingredient of the said
amended three charges against the Appellant.
SECOND INGREDIENT IN RESPECT OF THE THREE AMENDED
CHARGES
[11] As regards the Second Ingredient of the 3 Amended charges, this
Court finds that at the time the gratifications was accepted, the
Appellant was an agent ie, the officer of PDRM. Since the
month of December 2005, the Appellant was an officer of
PDRM. In the year 2014, the Appellant held the post of
Inspector of PDRM and was attached to Jabatan Siasatan
Jenayah IPD Kapit, Sarawak as stated in the Perakuan Tentang
Kedudukan atau Jawatan Yang DiPegang Oleh Mohamad Nazri
Bin Daheri (P27(1)) and the Appellant’s service record (P27 (2))
that kept by PW2, DSP Nur Ashyikin Bt Abdullah who is in
charge of the police personnel service records and human
resource of IPK Sarawak that the Appellant was a police
personnel at the material time, ie, (24 th August 2014, 11 th
September 2014 and 20 th October 2014) as per the 3 amended

14



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

charges. This fact also was never disputed or challenged at all
by the Appellant.
THIRD INGREDIENT IN RESPECT OF THE THREE AMENDED
CHARGES
[12] (1) As regards the Third Ingredient of the 3 amended charges,
this Court finds that the Appellant accepted the money
(gratification), for giving protection to PW1, who allegedly
committed an offence of illegal timber logging activities at
Sungai Sut, Kapit in respect of the said three amended charges.
(2) The telephone conversation recording (P13) and the
transcript (P13(1)) showed that the Appellant told PW1 not to
carry out any timber logging activities at Kapit because MACC
has a joint operation with Forestry department at Kapit on
24/9/2014. Furthermore, the audio-video recording (P4),
transcript (P5), audio-video recording (P18), the transcript
(P18(1)) also showed that the Appellant has requisite authority
to protect any illegal timber logging activities carried out by
PW1 at Sungai Sut, Kapit.
(3) It is immaterial whether the Appellant gave
to any illegal timber logging activities carried out
not. This Court is guided by the case of PP v.
[1985] 1 MLJ 298 where Shankar J (as he then
300-301 held as follows:-

any protection
by the PW1 or
You Kong Lai
was) at pages

“The presence of the word “solicit” in the section, to my
mind, clearly shows that if a person invites the payment of
monies so that he may allegedly use the same to bribe a
member of a public body, he has already committed an
offence. The fact that the corrupt purpose was not carried
out does not matter”.

(4) Further the Supreme Court in the case of PP v. Sally Chan
Kit Tong [1991] 1 CLJ (Rep) 396 at page 397 had held:
“[3] .... Any such demand solicited secretly, to be paid
without the knowledge of the State Government would
amount to corruption under.
[4] Section 3(a)(i) clearly states that any person who
corruptly receives any gratification “for himself or for any
other person” shall be guilty under the section.
At page 399, the court further held;
“... Any such demand solicited secretly and sought to be
paid under the counter without the knowledge of the State
Government would certainly amount to corruption under
the Prevention of Corruption Act.
... We find no merit in this submission as s. 3(a)(i) clearly
states any person who corruptly receives any gratification
“for himself or for any other person” shall be guilty under
the section. In the case of Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris
v. PP [1977] 2 MLJ 155 the accused was found guilty of
corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961
although the sum of RM250,000 which he had received
from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
was not for his own personal benefit but was for the funds
of UMNO”
(5) This Court finds that the wording employed in the section
19 of MACC Act 2009 showed that it is immaterial because the
words used was, “...to do anything in respect of any matter or
transaction, actual, or proposed or likely to take place”. Thus it
is immaterial whether there is any form of protection given by
the Appellant to PW1 or not.
16

(6) In the light of this Court’s above findings, this Court finds
that the Respondent has proved the third ingredient of all the
three amended charges against the Appellant.
[13] This Court finds that once the first two of the above ingredients
had been proved by the Respondent, the Appellant shall be
presumed to have accepted the said gratifications corruptly from
PW1 for the said three amended charges.
[14] In the case of PP v. Datuk Haji Harun Bin Idris (No. 2) [1977] 1
MLJ 15 at page 22, Y.A Raja Azlan Shah J (as His Lordship
then was) defined and explained the meaning of “corrupt” as
follows:“Corrupt” means “doing an act knowing that the act done
is wrong, doing so with evil feelings and evil intentions”.
(see Lim Kheng Kooi Reg) “purposely doing an act which
the law forbids” (see R Smith)
“Corrupt” is a question of intention. If the circumstances
show that what a person has done or has omitted to do was
moved by an evil intention or a guilty mind, then he is
liable under the section...........”
At page 23, His Lordship further held that:
“The word “inducement” evidently refers to a future act.
What is forbidden, generally speaking, is soliciting a
gratification as an inducement to do any matter or
transaction in which the State Government is concerned.
The gravamen of the offence is soliciting a gratification as
an inducement to do any official act or conduct. This need
not be proved by explicit evidence but may be inferred
from surrounding circumstances.”

[15] This Court finds that all the ingredients of the three amended
charges have been proved by the Respondent in respect of the
said three amended charges preferred against the Appellant.
Since all the essential ingredients have been proved, the
presumption under section 50(1) MACC Act 2009 applied, that
is the Appellant shall be presumed to have accepted the said sum
of RM3,000.00, as a gratification ie, money from PW1 (First
amended Charge) on 24 August 2014, at about 3.40 p.m.,
accepted the said sum of RM5,000.00 as gratification ie, money
from PW1 through the Maybank account of Fitero Bin Rafi’ee
(Second amended Charge) on 11/9/2014 at about 11.58am and
accepted the sum of RM8,000.00 as gratification ie, money from
PW1 (Third amended Charge) on 20/10/2014 at about 10.25am.
[16] This Court is guided by the case of Thavanathan a/l
Balasubramaniam v. Public Prosecutor [1997] 2 MLJ 401 at
page 421 where the Supreme Court held as follows:“In the instant case, once it was proved that the money
RM15,000 had been given to or received by the accused,
the presumption under s. 14 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1961 arose that the money had been given
and received corruptly as an inducement or reward to
acquit and discharge PW2 of the offence in the criminal
case, and it was for the accused to give an innocent
explanation which the court considered more likely than
not that it was true, ie on a balance of probabilities, the
test applied in civil proceedings: PP v. Yuvaraj [1969] 2
MLJ 89 (PC)”.
(Emphasis is mine)

18

Legal Network Series

[17] Further in the case of Attan bin Abdul Gani v. Public Prosecutor
[1970] 2 MLJ 143, at page 145, the court held inter alia as
follows:“Once it is proved that the gratification has been paid or
received then in the words of section 14 of the Act “Such
gratification shall be deemed to have been paid or
received corruptly...” The presumption at once arises
under the section. This presumption is a presumption of
law and it is obligatory on the court to raise it in every
proceeding for an offence under section 3 or 4 of the Act
provided it is proved that the gratification had been paid,
given or received. The prosecution has not to establish
anything more than the payment of money (See State of
Madras v. Vaidyanathan Iyer and Emden v. State of Uttar
Pradesh). It then becomes the duty of the accused to
disprove what section 14 begins to presume against him.”
(Emphasis is mine)
[18] The Appellant must offer an explanation that is “reasonably
sufficient to invite belief in its probable truthfulness” to rebut
the statutory presumption under section 50(1) MACC Act 2009
as stipulated in the case of Attan bin Abdul Gani v. Public
Prosecutor (supra) where the court at page 145 held as follows:
“The presumption cannot be said to have been rebutted
without sufficient evidence, ie, such evidence as is
reasonably sufficient to invite belief in its probable
truthfulness.”
(Emphasis is mine)
[19] The Appellant bears the burden of rebutting the presumption on
a balance of probabilities and this is what the case of Public
19



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

Prosecutor v. Ku Yahya Ku Bahari & Anor [2000] 3 CLJ 162,
held at page 168:
“When the prosecution is minded in invoking the
presumption, then the particular burden of proof, as
opposed to a general burden, shifts to the defence to rebut
such presumption on a balance of probabilities. This from
a defence point of view is heavier than the burden of
casting a reasonable doubt, but is certainly lighter than
the burden of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable
doubt”.
(Emphasis is mine)
WHETHER THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN LAW
AND IN FACT THAT IN CONVICTING THE APPELLANT
BASED ON THE UNCORROBORATED HEARSAY EVIDENCE?
[20] The Appellant complained that the learned trial judge convicted
the Appellant based on the hearsay evidence namely the
testimony of PW3 because PW3 heard from the public that the
Appellant gave protection to the illegal logging activity prior to
the incident at Tekam Café, Kapit.
[21] This Court finds that this contention of the Appellant has no
merits as the learned trial judge did not convict the Appellant
solely based on this piece of evidence of PW3. In so far as the
first amended charge is concerned, the solicitation was in the
form of oral request made by the Appellant before PW1 passed
the said sum of RM3000.00 to the Appellant. This is evidenced
by in the audio-video recording (P4) and transcript (P5). For the
amended second charge, the solicitation was in the form of text
messages stated in the forensic reports (P7 & P8) before PW1
deposited RM5000.00 into the account of Fitero Bin Rafi’ee as
20



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

requested by the Appellant. For the third amended charge, the
solicitation was in the form of text messages stated in the
forensic reports (P8) before the entrapment on 20/10/2014.
[22] Furthermore, even if this Court excludes the testimony of PW3,
PW1’S testimony is corroborated by the audio- video recording
(P4), transcript (P5) in respect of the first amended charge. For
the second amended charge, the testimony of PW1 is
corroborated by the tele-conversation recording (P9), the
transcript (P9(1)), the said text messages stated in the forensic
reports (P7 & P8), the bank in slip (P11) and the statement of
Fitero Bin Rafi’ee (P56). Besides that, the testimony of PW1 is
also corroborated by the audio-video recording (P18), the
transcript (P18(1), the said text messages stated in the forensic
reports (P7 & P8), and the said trap money (P15(1)) which was
found inside the bag (P17) carried by the Appellant when the
Appellant was caught red-handed on the spot in respect of the
third amended charge. In the light of the above evidences, this
Court finds that there are credible evidences to corroborate the
testimony of PW1 for the said three amended charges against the
Appellant.
WHETHER THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE WAS ERRED IN
LAW AND FACT THAT HE FAILED TO CONSIDER THE
DEFENCE AS WHOLE AND THE RESPONDENT FAILED TO
PROVE ITS CASE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT?
[23] In his defence, the Appellant (DW1) testified inter alia that he
has never solicited any corrupt money from PW1 in respect of
the said three amended charges. As regards the incident at
Tekam Café on 24/8/2014, the Appellant contended that PW1
sought help from the Appellant and asked the Appellant to play
the role of a “middleman” between PW1 and the village folks at
21



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

Sungai Sut, Kapit because PW1 wanted the Appellant to solve
the dispute between PW1 and the affected village folks in
relation to the timber logging activity which was carried out by
PW1. The Appellant agreed with the proposal of PW1 and said
that he will appoint a “middleman” who was known as Fitero to
solve the dispute as well as the compensation to be paid by PW1
to the affected villager folks because the Appellant thought that
he has the responsibility to ensure the safety of the parties
involved as well as to keep the public in peace. Thus the
Appellant decided to help PW1 and the affected village folks to
avoid any dispute which could cause any death amongst the
parties involved.
[24] The Appellant further testified that he then requested the said
Fitero to be a “middleman” to help PW1, to pay the affected
village folks compensation as PW1 has operated the timber
logging activities within the area of the affected village folks
regardless of PW1 has a valid licence or not. The Appellant
further contended that it is normal practice when it involves a
timber company and the affected village folks to pay
compensation notwithstanding that there is no legal requirement
to do so.
[25] The Appellant also contended that he never received any money
from PW1 at Tekam Café although PW1 took out some money
and showed to the Appellant. As regards the incident at the café
of Kingwood Hotel, the Appellant contended that he met PW1
for getting the money from PW1 as compensation to be paid to
the affected village folks, because the said Fitero informed the
Appellant that PW1’s company has extracted the timber logs
without the knowledge of the affected village folks who
complained about it. The Appellant believed what was told to
him by the said Fitero. The Appellant tried to look for Fitero

22



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

because he wanted to know what Fitero did with the money
which was banked in by PW1 into Fitero’s bank account but the
said Fitero cannot be found.
[26] The Appellant also contended that the money he received from
PW1 at the café of Kingwood Hotel was compensation to be
paid to the affected village folks, because the said Fitero
informed the Appellant that PW1’s company has extracted the
timber logs without the knowledge of the affected village folks.
The said money he received from PW1 at the café of Kingwood
Hotel is neither a corrupt money nor personal gain for him.
EVALUATION OF THE APPELLANT’S DEFENCE
THE FIRST AMENDED CHARGE
[27] As regards the first amended charge, the Appellant stated that he
never received any money from PW1 notwithstanding that PW1
took out some money and showed them to the Appellant. The
action and movement of the Appellant receiving RM3000.00
from PW1 is clearly recorded audio-visually in Exhibit P4 and
this was witnessed by PW3 who attended the said meeting with
PW1 at Tekam Café, Kapit. The Appellant stated that he never
solicited any money from PW1, but his denial is rebutted by the
transcript (P5). Furthermore, the Appellant also admitted that
the voice 1 belonged to PW1 and that voice 2 was him as stated
in the transcript (P5). However, the Appellant claimed that his
interpretation of the wordings stated in the Exhibit P5 is that the
Appellant appointed Fitero to handle the problem between PW1
and the affected village folks. However this Court noted that the
name of Fitero is never mentioned in Exhibit P5 even though the
said Fitero played such a vital role in this case. Thus this Court
finds that the appointment of Fitero as “middleman” alleged by
23



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

the Appellant is only an afterthought because the issue of
appointment of Fitero as “middleman” only arises at the defence
stage. When the prosecution referred to Lines 58-61, 77-82, 86,
91-94, 117-123, 142-145, 164 of Exhibit P5 during the cross
examination of the Appellant, the Appellant kept merely
denying the questions posed by the prosecution and failed to
give any reasonable explanation. Furthermore, the Appellant
also denied that Voice 2 was him when referred to the said
transcript (P5) which is contradicted his earlier answer.
[28] If indeed the Appellant has nothing to do with the case, the
pertinent question to ask is why did he ask for the payment from
PW1 since he claimed that Fitero was the “middleman”. The
said Fitero himself should be dealing with PW1 directly since he
is “middleman” and not the Appellant. Furthermore no one ever
met or saw the said Fitero and he has never attend any meeting
with PW1. Nor was the said Fitero ever mentioned in any
transcripts produced during the prosecution’s case. Thus this
Court finds that the said Fitero’s role as a “middleman” is a
mere afterthought and simply not credible.
[29] As regards the second amended charge, the said sum of
RM5000.00 was deposited into Fitero’s bank account under the
instruction of the Appellant instead of Fitero. The Celcom
statement (P57) confirmed that handphone no: 0198196900 is
registered under the name of the Appellant who admitted to this
during cross-examination. In Lampiran C, page 16-18 of P7, it
showed that the Appellant asked PW1 to pay him money but
PW1 informed the Appellant that his boss asked to reduce the
amount of payment as the timber is yet to be extracted. PW1
also proposed the amount of payment to the Appellant in the
range of RM4000 to RM5000. In response, the Appellant told
PW1 to pay him, the sum of RM5000. This showed that the

24



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

Appellant was acting on his own as he did not need to refer to
the middleman “Fitero” for agreement.
[30] PW1 then asked the Appellant to give him a bank account
number for to deposit the said sum of RM5,000.00. The
Appellant sent a Maybank account no: 161097026746 under the
name of Fitero bin Rafiee to PW1 and asked PW1 to inform the
Appellant once the sum of RM5000 is banked into this bank
account. Later, the Appellant also ask PW1 whether PW1 has
banked in the said sum of RM5000.00 into the said bank
account. After PW1 told the Appellant that he has banked in the
RM5000.00 into the said bank account, the Appellant was
thankful to PW1 for the said deposit of RM5000.00. Later the
Appellant confirmed with PW1 that the RM5000.00 was already
in the said bank account. This Court finds that the said Fotero’s
account was used by the Appellant for PW1, to deposit the said
sum of RM5,000.00 for the Appellant’s own benefit.
[31] As regards the third amended charge, the sum of RM8000 was
recovered from the bag (P17) which was carried by the
Appellant on his arrest at the café of Kingwood Hotel. The
action and movement of the Appellant receiving the RM8000.00
from PW1 is recorded audio-visually in Exhibit P18. Lines 1516 of the transcript (P18(1)) showed that PW1 told the Appellant
that the RM8000.00 requested by the Appellant was with him
and PW1 asked the Appellant whether there was any problem.
The Appellant informed PW1 that there was no problem at all.
Lines 27-30 of P18(1) showed that PW1 showed the said trap
money to the Appellant and told him that the amount of the
money was RM8000.00 and the Appellant replied “OK”. When
PW1 asked the Appellant whether he want to put the said trap
money inside the said bag (P17), the Appellant instructed PW1
to put the said trap money into his bag (P17). This Court thus

25



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

finds that the Appellant accepted the said sum of RM8,000.00
corruptly.
[32] The Appellant also stated that it was normal practice when it
involves a timber company and the affected village folks to pay
compensation notwithstanding that there is no legal requirement
to do so. This Court finds that such a defence is not admissible
pursuant to s. 57 of the MACC Act 2009. Section 57 of the
MACC Act 2009 states as follows:
“In any civil or criminal proceedings under this Act,
evidence shall not be admissible to show that any such
gratification as is mentioned in this Act is customary in
any profession, trade, vocation or calling or on a social
occasion.”
[33] In the light of this Court’s above findings, this Court finds that
the Appellant’s defence is merely a bare denial and an
afterthought.
[34] Guidance can be found in the case of Shamim Reza bin Abdul
Samad v. PP [2009] 2 MLJ 506 at page 514 and 518. YA
Suriyadi JCA (as he then was) held as follows:
“[12] Pertaining to the defence of the existence of a third
party, the learned judge commented that at no stage of the
prosecution was this defence raised and tested. No
prosecution’s witness was grilled on this highly relevant
issue and hence was an afterthought defence.”
...
“[27] We found no evidence of the appellant seriously
challenging any of the prosecution’s witnesses at the stage
of the cross-examination let alone testing his defence at

26



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

the earliest opportunity ie at the prosecution‟s stage.
Without such a challenge the credibility of the
prosecution’s witnesses especially SP10 must remain
intact.”
[35] Suriyadi JCA (as he then was) in Shamim Reza bin Abdul Samad
v. PP (supra) held at page 519 held as follows:“[29] The submission of the existence of a third party,
put in another way, is bare denial defence. The effect of
that defence is that he did not kill the deceased. Another
person did it. Having read the evidence, and without a
single good and sufficient reason, we were unable to
accept his bare denial as sufficient to create any doubt in
our mind as to the non-existence of a third person let
alone his denial killing the deceased.”
(Emphasis is mine)
[36] In the light of this Court’s above findings, this Court thus finds
that the Respondent has failed to rebut the statutory presumption
that the money was also corruptly accepted on a balance of
probabilities in respect of the said three amended charges.
[37] This Court also finds that the defence of the Appellant is a bare
denial which is insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption
that the money was corruptly accepted in respect of the said
three amended charges. In the Federal Court case of D.A Duncan
v. PP [1980] 2 MLJ 195, at para D, Raja Azlan Shah C.J.
(Malaya) (as His Royal Highness then was) held inter alia as
follows:
“The defence was, in effect, a simple denial of the
evidence connecting the appellant with the four boxes. We
cannot see any plausible ground for saying that the four
27



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

boxes were not his. In the circumstances of the prosecution
evidence, the High Court came in our view, to the correct
conclusion that this denial did not cast a reasonable
doubt on the prosecution case against the appellant”.
(Emphasis is mine)
[38] In the light of the above this Court finds that the defence of the
Appellant has failed to cast a reasonable doubt at the end of the
defence case. Thus the learned trial judge was right to find the
Appellant guilty and convicted him on the said three amended
charges.
APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCES
[39] This Court finds that the learned trial judge has correctly and
adequately considered all the relevant factors including the
Appellant’s mitigation before imposing the sentences. The
learned trial judge has adequately considered the public interest
and deterrence factor in imposing sentence. As far as the
sentence imposed against the Appellant is concerned, this Court
finds that the sentence imposed, is accordance with the law as
far as section 17(a) and section 24 MACC 2009 are concerned.
[40] Corruption is a very serious offence and are very rampant
nowadays. The Federal Court in the case of PP v. Dato’ Waad
Mansor [2005] 1 CLJ 421 at page 434 stated as follows;
“The offence of corruption, if unabated or undeterred, is
more far reaching in its consequences that the crimes of
robbery, criminal breach of trust or rape. Thus, we feel
that the sentences imposed for offences of corruption
should be deterrent in nature so as to reflect the gravity of
the offences”.

28



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

[41] The Federal Court in Public Prosecutor v. Dato’ Wa ad Mansor
(supra) further held at page 440-441as follows:
“The CA had placed much emphasis on the fact that the
respondents political career is destroyed, the positions he
once held lost and possibly never to be recovered and his
good name tarnished. With respect, these are by no means
extenuating circumstances which could attract sympathy.
These in fact are considerations that the respondent should
have in mind before he embarked upon this nefarious
scheme and they certainly should not have an
overwhelming effect on the sentencing process as held by
the CA”.
[42] Further guidance can be found in the case of Hamidon bin Mat
Yatim v. PP [1995] 3 CLJ 724 where the court held at page 736
as follows:
“Corrupt Government servants should be sentenced
severely as examples to other and also to protect the image
of the Government service as a whole. It is common
knowledge that cases of corruption are difficult to prove
but when a case is proved the offender should be
imprisoned and such a sentence would be consistent with
the enormity of the offence committed by him and,
likewise, be in direct proportion to the measure of
confidence which the Government has reposed in him. I
venture to say that the fact that the appellant here has lost
his important post and suffered the anguish of a trial and
the appeal cannot be considered to be a mitigating
circumstance”.

29



[2017] 1 LNS 154

Legal Network Series

[43] Section 24 of the MACC 2009 stipulates the punishment for an
offence under section 17(a) MACC 2009. Fine and imprisonment
is mandatory. This Court finds that there is no reason to disagree
or to interfere with the sentences imposed by the learned trial
judge and that the sentence imposed is not manifestly excessive.
The imprisonment term imposed on the Appellant is only for a
period of 3 years and 10 months for the said 3 amended charges
which run consecutively from the date of conviction in respect
of the said three amended charges bearing in mind that the
maximum term of imprisonment of the offences charged is 20
years. Thus this Court finds that the sentence imposed is not
manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case.
ORDER
[44] In the light of this Court’s above findings, this Court finds that
there are no merits in this appeal. In the premises, this Court
thus dismiss this appeal conviction and sentence.
