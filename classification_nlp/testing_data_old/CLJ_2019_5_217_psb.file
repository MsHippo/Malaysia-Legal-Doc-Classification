The applicant, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences under the Penal Code, the Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009 and the Anti-Money Laundering, AntiTerrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.
Initially, the prosecution in court was led by the Attorney General (‘AG’).
However, the office of the AG later issued a media release (‘the AG media
release’) which, inter alia, revealed that the prosecution of the criminal
proceedings against the applicant would be led by Datuk Hj Sulaiman
Abdulah (‘DHSA’), an advocate and solicitor, who was appointed by the AG
for that purpose under s. 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘CPC’). In the
present application, by way of a notice of motion, the applicant sought for



218

[2019] 5 CLJ

an order that the respondent (‘the prosecution’) produce a copy of the letter
of appointment and copies of other authorisation, in writing, executed by the
prosecution in relation to the appointment of DHSA. In support of his
application, the applicant submitted that (i) the pre-requisite for DHSA to
conduct prosecutions would be the existence of ‘authorisation in writing’
under s. 377(b)(1) of the CPC or a ‘permission in writing’ of the Public
Prosecutor (‘PP’) under s. 379 of the CPC; (ii) since there was no letter of
appointment, authorisation or fiat, the court could not take cognisance of the
locus standi of DHSA to appear on behalf of the prosecution; (iii) until and
unless the issue was resolved, all actions of DHSA, to date, could potentially
be rendered a nullity; (iv) by virtue of s. 55 of the Interpretation Acts 1948
and 1967 (‘IA’), based on the analogy to the provision relating to the need
for the written ‘consent’ or ‘sanction’ of the PP in the institution of cases,
the courts have declared that the same must be produced. A similar argument
was raised in respect of s. 129 of the CPC which, also, does not specify the
need to produce the instrument of appointment of the appointee, yet the
courts have held that unless the same is produced, the court could not take
cognisance of the same; (v) in AK Koh Enterprise v. PP, the letter authorising
the prosecuting officer under s. 377 of the CPC was regarded as a sanction,
which must be produced before the court, in order to vest it with the requisite
jurisdiction; and (vi) the prosecution’s refusal to produce the instrument, by
reason of the classification of the same as an official secret under the Official
Secrets Act 1972 (‘OSA’), was wholly misconceived. Resisting the
application, the prosecution submitted that (i) the application was (a) not
supported by law nor did it disclose a valid reason or basis for the order
sought; and (b) neither alleged mala fide on the part of the prosecution when
appointing DHSA nor stated how the applicant was prejudiced by the
appointment that would warrant the need to have sight of the letter of
appointment; (ii) the applicant did not file an application to challenge the
appointment of DHSA. The filing of a notice of motion was, at best, a fishing
or fault-finding expedition or a deliberate delay of due process by filing
irrelevant and frivolous applications; (iii) the appointment of DHSA had
been announced to the general public via the AG media release which,
without any ambiguity, explained the reasons for the appointment; and
(iv) the application was a non-starter since the relevant instrument of
appointment had been classified under the OSA that would now be
prohibited from disclosure.

Held (dismissing application):
(1) There was lack of clarity in the present application – whether the
applicant was challenging the appointment of DHSA. The applicant said
he was but the respondent said otherwise. The court was inclined to
agree with the respondent on this because the notice of motion merely
prayed for the production of the instrument of the appointment of DHSA

by the PP. A proper challenge to the appointment ought to have been
made more definitively and the basis for the same be stated with
certainty – be it in a form of impropriety or procedural error in the said
appointment. However, the applicant furnished nothing to that effect in
the requisite notion, as well as in the accompanying affidavit in support.
The applicant should have more properly filed an application for the
discovery of the instrument of appointment, which was instead now, the
subject of the instant application. (paras 25, 27 & 28)
(2) The present application could be a precursor to the actual challenge of
the appointment; but if that was the case, the production application
should be dealt with separately. The true legal basis for this pre-trial
criminal application, which was not fashioned on the basis of discovery
under s. 51 of the CPC for the production of a document, which at the
same time had absolutely nothing to do with the preparation of the
applicant’s defence, could be questioned. It is fairly settled that pre-trial
discovery is only permitted for documents mentioned in the charge
against the accused. (paras 29-31)
(3) The language of s. 379 of the CPC does not give rise to any ambiguity
for it plainly vests in the PP, and no other, the prerogative and authority
to authorise the employment of an advocate, by way of a permission in
writing, to conduct a prosecution. Neither was there any dispute that
DHSA fulfilled the status of an advocate within s. 379 of the CPC.
Nowhere in s. 379 or in Chapter XXXVII or in the entire CPC itself,
is it stated that the letter of permission on the employment of the
advocate chosen by the PP under that provision must be shown to the
court where the advocate so appears, let alone produced to the accused.
(paras 32 & 33)
(4) The court could not readily subscribe to the contention of the applicant,
regarding the arguments on s. 55 of the IA and s. 129 of the CPC,
because the provisions were clearly concerned with the requisite
authorisation or sanction of the PP in respect of the institution of
criminal proceedings. This was entirely different from the authorisation
or permission to appoint a qualified person to conduct criminal
prosecution under provisions such as ss. 377 and 379 of the CPC. The
applicant relied on the case of AK Koh Enterprise v. PP, which ruled that
the court had no jurisdiction in the absence of the authorisation and also
suggested that proof of authorisation would be satisfied by having the
same produced in court. A more accurate position in law, on this point,
was well-clarified in PP v. Lew Koy which clearly held that the
instrument of appointment was only required to be shown to the court,
and not even the accused, if there was any challenge that the prosecuting
officer, having conduct of the prosecution, did not have the requisite



220

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

authority in writing of the PP to appear in court and conduct the
proceedings. However, the applicant did not clearly state the reasons for
the purported challenge. (paras 39-43 & 47)
(5) The fact of the absence of a real or valid challenge was further fortified
by another key reason; the AG media release which (i) made public the
appointment of DHSA under s. 379 of the CPC to lead the prosecution
in this case; and (ii) contained the reasons for the appointment and the
choice of the advocate. Furthermore, the AG media release was issued
by the AG Chambers and stated to be the statement of the PP, himself.
Despite knowing the basis of the appointment, the applicant did not
move to set the reasons as to why it was flawed. Instead, the attack was
made merely for the production of the instrument. This was wholly
insufficient, if not patently untenable. (paras 51, 53, 56 & 64)
(6) Whilst the competing arguments on the effects of classification of
documents as official secret under the OSA were usually compelling as
they were weighty and deserving of a critical analysis, in view of the
other reasons stated earlier, it was unnecessary to consider and
determine whether the prosecution could validly rely on the certificate
under s. 16A of the OSA, which had classified the instrument of
appointment of DHSA under s. 379 of the CPC as an official secret, to
produce production of the same. (para 77)
(7) The application was bereft of reasons which were sufficiently cogent to
justify production of the instrument of appointment. Nor did it
satisfactorily explain how the applicant would be prejudiced by the nondisclosure of the said letter of appointment. The view of the applicant,
that there was a risk of the trial being nullified by reason of nonproduction constituting prejudice, was tenuous and lacking merit.
Significantly, the argument that the non-disclosure or non-production
meant the absence of locus on the part of DHSA which, in turn, would
affect the jurisdiction of the court, and risk any proceedings be held to
be a nullity, was too speculative and, in any event, flawed. (paras 78 & 79)

Introduction

D

[1]
This is an application by a notice of motion for an order that the
respondent produces a copy of the letter of appointment and copies of other
authorisation in writing executed by the respondent in relation to the
appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman bin Abdullah as a prosecutor under
s. 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
[2]
At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the application and
highlighted the principal reasons for the same. This judgment sets out the full
reasons for the refusal.

E

F

Key Background Facts
[3]
The applicant has been accused of seven criminal charges concerning
offences under the Penal Code, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission
Act 2009 (“the MACC Act”) and the Anti-Money Laundering, AntiTerrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (“the
AMLATFA”).
[4]
On 8 August 2018, all seven charges were ordered by this High Court
to be jointly tried. Trial dates have been fixed, to commence on 12 February
2019 and to continue until 29 March 2019.

G

H

I

[5]
When the applicant was first charged on 4 July 2018 with the first four
charges, the Attorney General led the prosecution in court.
[6]
On 31 August 2018, the office of the Attorney General issued a media
release which included the statement that the prosecution of this criminal
proceeding against the applicant would be led by Datuk Haji Sulaiman bin
Abdullah (“Datuk Haji Sulaiman”), an advocate and solicitor of the High
Court of Malaya, who had been appointed by the Attorney General for that
purpose under s. 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“the CPC”) (“the AG
media release”).



222

[7]

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

Section 379 of the CPC reads as follows:

A

379. Employment of advocate
With the permission in writing of the Public Prosecutor an advocate may
be employed on behalf of the Government to conduct any criminal
prosecution or inquiry, or to appear on any criminal appeal or point of law
reserved on behalf of the Public Prosecutor. The advocate shall be paid
out of the public funds such remuneration as may be sanctioned by the
Minister of Finance and while conducting such prosecution or inquiry, or
appearing on such criminal appeal or point of law reserved, shall be
deemed to be a “public servant”.

[8]
At a subsequent case management, the lead counsel for the applicant
asked that he be given a copy of the letter of the appointment of Datuk Haji
Sulaiman by the Attorney General, but this was refused by the respondent.
According to the lead counsel for the applicant, a number of other subsequent
similar requests, including made in writing, had also been denied by the
respondent.
[9]

B

C

D

Hence, the present application before me.

[10] At the start of the hearing, the respondent raised a preliminary
objection against the application, arguing that it was made too late in the day,
only on 26 November 2018 when the AG media release had been issued
much earlier on 31 August 2018.
[11] I overruled the objection on the basis that the lead counsel for the
applicant had orally raised the request earlier, and had subsequently followed
up with the same, but this continued to be refused by the respondent. I also
rejected the admission of two affidavits filed by the respondent the evening
before the hearing in the absence of any leave of this court.

E

F

Summary Of The Contentions Of The Parties
[12] The applicant premised its key argument that the key pre-requisite for
an advocate like Datuk Haji Sulaiman to conduct prosecutions would be the
existence of an ‘authorisation in writing’ under s. 377(b)(1) of the CPC or a
‘permission in writing’ of the Public Prosecutor as provided for in s. 379 of
the CPC.
[13] The applicant asserted that its challenge concerned the validity of the
appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman under s. 379 of the CPC, specifically
on what the applicant described as a foundational question as to whether
Datuk Haji Sulaiman has, before this court the requisite rights of audience
by which to conduct this prosecution.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

223

[14] It was submitted that since no such letter of appointment or
authorisation or fiat has been produced for the inspection of the court, this
court cannot therefore take cognizance of the locus standi of Datuk Haji
Sulaiman to appear on behalf of the respondent in this court. More crucially,
the applicant maintained that until and unless the issue is resolved, all actions
of Datuk Haji Sulaiman to date could potentially be rendered a nullity.
[15] The applicant took the stance that given his challenge, the production
of the instrument of authority is therefore mandatory.

F

G

H

I

[16] The applicant further sought to draw support from the provision of
s. 55 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967, on the basis that by analogy
to the provision relating to the need for the written ‘consent’ or ‘sanction’
of the Public Prosecutor in the institution of cases, the courts have also
declared that the same must be produced.
[17] Thus in AK Koh Enterprise Sdn Bhd v. PP [2000] 1 LNS 200; [2000]
6 MLJ 184, the letter authorising the prosecuting officer under s. 377 of the
CPC was regarded as a sanction which must be produced before the court in
order to vest it with the requisite jurisdiction.
[18] The applicant therefore submitted that it was mandatorily incumbent
on the respondent to produce before this court the instrument authorising
Datuk Haji Sulaiman to appear on behalf of the Public Prosecutor and have
conduct of the prosecution.
[19] It is also the position taken by the applicant that the respondent’s
refusal to produce the instrument by reason of the classification of the same
as an “official secret” under the Official Secrets Act 1972 (“the OSA”) was
wholly misconceived.
[20] The respondent, in its resistance to this application, on the other hand
submitted that first, this application was not supported by law nor did it
disclose a valid reason or basis for the order sought. The application, so the
respondent asserted, did not furnish any valid reasons for the production of
the letter of appointment which would serve as a ground for this court to act
upon.
[21] This, according to the respondent was especially pertinent as the
application neither alleged mala fide on the part of the respondent when
appointing Datuk Haji Sulaiman nor stated how the applicant was prejudiced
by this appointment that would warrant the need to have sight of the letter
of appointment.
[22] Secondly, it was highlighted by the respondent that the applicant did
not actually file an application to challenge Datuk Haji Sulaiman’s
appointment but had chosen to instead file a notice of motion for the
production of his letter of appointment. This, the respondent argued



224

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

suggested that the same was merely a baseless application and served, at best,
as a fishing or fault finding expedition or that the applicant was deliberately
delaying due process by filing irrelevant and frivolous applications.
[23] Thirdly, the respondent maintained that the appointment of Datuk
Haji Sulaiman by the Attorney General (as the Public Prosecutor) pursuant
to s. 379 of the CPC had been announced to the general public via the
Attorney General’s media release dated 31 August 2018 which, without any
ambiguity, explained the reasons for the appointment.
[24] Fourthly, the respondent also argued that this application was a nonstarter since the relevant instrument of appointment had been classified under
the OSA that would now be prohibited from disclosure.

Evaluation And Findings Of This Court
Nature And Application
[25] In this case before me, there is a certain lack of clarity in the true
nature of this application – whether the applicant is challenging the
appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman. The applicant said he was. The
respondent said otherwise. I am inclined to agree with the respondent on this
because the notice of motion merely prays for the production of the
instrument of the appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman by the Public
Prosecutor.

D

E

[26] What else to make of the following prayers sought for in the notice of
motion filed by the applicant:
(a) Prayer 1
The Applicant seeks an order from this Honourable Court to compel
the Respondent to produce Datuk Haji Sulaiman bin Abdullah’s
letter of appointment and copies of any other authorisation in
writing executed by the Respondent in relation to his appointment
as a Deputy Public Prosecutor;
(b) Prayer 2

F

G

The Applicant be provided with copies of the letter of appointment
and documents produced by the Respondent pursuant to Prayer 1;
and
(c) Prayer 3

H

The Applicant seeks any further and/or other order, relief or
direction which this Honourable Court may deem fit and proper in
the circumstances.

[27] Notwithstanding the above, the applicant maintained that what was
being challenged herein was the locus standi of Datuk Hj Sulaiman to appear
on behalf of the Public Prosecutor and to have conduct of the prosecution,
and that this could only be established by the production of the document
sought for.

[2019] 5 CLJ
A

B

C

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

225

[28] In my view, a proper challenge to the appointment ought to have been
made more definitively and the basis for the same be stated with certainty
– be it a form of impropriety or procedural error in the said appointment.
But the applicant had furnished nothing to that effect in the requisite notice
as well as in the accompanying affidavit in support. The applicant should
have more properly filed an application to challenge Datuk Haji Sulaiman’s
appointment and thereafter, file an application for discovery of the
instrument of appointment which was instead now the subject of the instant
application.
[29] It may well be that this present application could be a precursor to the
actual challenge of the appointment; but if that was the case, then the
production application should be dealt with separately in that other
proceeding, if any.

D

[30] As such, the true legal basis for this pre-trial criminal application,
which was also not fashioned on the basis of discovery under s. 51 of the CPC
for the production of a document which at the same time has absolutely
nothing to do with the preparation of the defence of the applicant, can
therefore be questioned.

E

[31] After all, it is fairly settled that pre-trial discovery is only permitted
for documents mentioned in the charge against the accused. The Federal
Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2010] 4 CLJ 265; [2010] 2 MLJ 312
held as follows:

F

G

H

I

[45] Learned counsel for the appellant then urged us to depart from
Raymond Chia. We find no justification to do so. We have looked at the
authorities presented to us during arguments, including those from India
and Singapore and found them united in their holding that s. 51 must
necessarily operate within certain inbuilt limitations. Although the
language in that section is seemingly wide it should not literally be taken
to be capable of allowing for a wide-ranging application as was allowed
by the High Court in this case. Its scope, according to all the authorities
that we have read, is confined to the production of documents or
materials which are 'necessary or desirable' for the purposes of the trial.
And these two qualifications depends on which particular stage or point
of time the application was made. If, as happened in this case, it was made
at the pre-trial stage, then the discovery must, according to the principles
we have alluded to earlier, be confined to the matters that are specified
in the charge. This is so because the justice of the case would have been
met if the appellant had been fully notified of the charge he faces. He
cannot then be said to be at any disadvantage to prepare his defence. At
this stage, the documents and materials that the court may compel
production are confined to those that are necessary and desirable to the
trial. And the charge in this case, in our view, is specific and is sufficiently
particularised to accord the appellant a fair trial. Put another way, the
requirement of justice as envisaged by the Supreme Court in Raymond
Chia has, in this case, been met, sans the discovery of those documents
and materials.



226

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[46] Now, the appellant contends that what he required was essential and
relevant to the preparation of his defence. But at this stage, the defence
is not yet a relevant consideration for the court hearing this application.
The appellant’s application should not be turned into a mini-trial to
determine his defence on the charge (see State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath
Padhi).

No Legal Requirement To Produce Letter Of Permission Under s. 379 Of The CPC
[32] I do not think the language of s. 379 of the CPC, as set out earlier,
gives rise to any ambiguity. For it plainly vests in the Public Prosecutor and
no other, the prerogative and authority to authorise the employment of an
advocate by way of permission in writing to conduct a prosecution (see the
decision of the Federal Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim v. Public
Prosecutor [2014] 1 CLJ 289; [2014] 1 MLJ 317). Neither is there any dispute
that Datuk Haji Sulaiman fulfilled the status of an advocate within this s. 379.
[33] Nowhere in s. 379 or in Chapter XXXVII or in the entire of the CPC
itself for that matter is it stated that the letter of permission on the
employment of the advocate chosen by the Public Prosecutor under that
provision must be shown to the court where the advocate so authorised
appears, let alone produced to the accused.
[34] The applicant said it would be unnecessary for the law to specify
production and attempted to rely on s. 55 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and
1967 (“the IA”) to augment its argument on the need for production of the
fiat. This provision concerns the ability of a person to conduct prosecution.
[35]

A

B

C

D

E

Section 55 reads as follows:

55. Evidence of signature on fiat, etc.
Any written law providing that the fiat, consent or authority of any person
is necessary before any prosecution or other legal proceedings are begun,
or for any other purpose in connection with any legal proceedings, shall
be deemed also to provide that any document purporting to be or to bear
the signed fiat, consent or authority of that person shall be received as
prima facie evidence in any proceedings without proof being given that the
signature is what it purports to be.

F

G

[36] The contention involved the approach of drawing analogy to the
provision relating to the need for the written ‘consent’ or ‘sanction’ of the
Public Prosecutor in the institution of cases. The courts, according to the
applicant have also declared that the same must be produced in order for the
requirement to be deemed complied with.

H

[37] A similar argument was raised by the applicant in respect of s. 129 of
the CPC which also does not specify the need to produce the instrument of
appointment of the appointee. Yet the courts have, as asserted by the
applicant held that unless the same is produced, the court cannot take
cognisance of the same.

[39] However, I cannot readily subscribe to this contention of the applicant
because these ss. 55 of the IA and 129 of the CPC are clearly provisions
concerning the requisite authorisation or sanction of the Public Prosecutor
in respect of the institution of criminal proceedings. This is entirely different
from the authorisation or permission to appoint a qualified person to conduct
criminal prosecution under provisions such as ss. 377 and 379 of the CPC.
The cases referred to by the applicant mainly concern the former scenario.
[40] The applicant nevertheless also referred to a number of cases to
support its position vis-à-vis the sanction on the choice of person conducting
the criminal prosecution. Thus in AK Koh Enterprise v. PP [2000] 1 LNS 200;
[2000] 6 MLJ 184 the High Court held in the headnotes of the report:



228

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

A prosecuting officer may, under a particular law, institute a criminal
proceeding but he must be authorised by the Public Prosecutor. Such an
authorisation or sanction to prosecute is required for each offence, and must be
tendered into court before the trial begins so as to confer jurisdiction on the court. In
the present case, the offence committed by the appellant is a seizable
offence, thus a sanction or authorisation to prosecute the case from the
Public Prosecutor is mandatory. As no authorisation letter was produced
or tendered in court when the trial of the appellant began, the practice of
presuming that the authorisation had been given to the prosecuting officer
adopted by the learned magistrate was ultra vires the law. This is because
without this authorisation, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case and
this defect cannot be cured (see pp 186B-E, 188D). (emphasis added)

[41] The case of AK Koh Enterprise, decided by Muhammad Kamil J ruled
that the court has no jurisdiction in the absence of the authorisation and also
suggested in effect that proof of authorisation would be satisfied by having
the same produced in court. The applicant also submitted that another High
Court decision, which was written by Low Hop Bing J (as he then was) in
the case of Anuar Abdul Aziz v. PP [2005] 6 CLJ 309; [2006] 1 MLJ 380 also
supported his position.
[42] In my view, a more accurate position in law on this point is well
clarified in another earlier High Court decision, which both the applicant and
the respondent relied on in their respective oral and written submissions.
This is the case of PP v. Lew Koy [2002] 1 CLJ 86; [2001] 4 MLJ 655, where
VT Singham JC (as he then was) instructively held as follows:
On the issue of the written authority from the Public Prosecutor pursuant
to s. 377(b) of the CPC, this court is of the view that the written authority
need not be tendered or filed in court but is only required to show to the
court if ever there is any challenge that the prosecuting officer who is
having conduct of the prosecution did not have the authority in writing
of the Public Prosecutor to appear in court and conduct the proceedings.
In such a situation, the prosecuting officer is only required to show to the
court that he has been issued with the written authority by the Public
Prosecutor or the deputy public prosecutor and it need not be tendered
as an exhibit or filed in court as it is not a document shown to a witness
and referred to by him in his evidence or by an affidavit (see Stroud’s
Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases (6th Ed) Vol 1 for definition of
‘exhibit’).

[43] There is as such no legal requirement that any letter of appointment
giving authority for a person to appear and conduct prosecution in court,
including under s. 379 of the CPC must be produced to the accused. Public
Prosecutor v. Lew Koy clearly held that the instrument of appointment such as
the one in contention before this court is only required to be shown to the
court (and not even the accused) if there is any challenge that the prosecuting
officer having conduct of the prosecution does not have the requisite
authority in writing of the Public Prosecutor to appear in court and conduct
the proceedings.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

229

A

[44] An authorisation letter from the Public Prosecutor to a prosecuting
officer to appear in court and conduct the proceedings need not therefore be
tendered or filed in court and is instead only compelled to be shown to the
court if there is a challenge to the authority of the prosecuting officer to
conduct the criminal prosecution.

B

[45] Public Prosecutor v. Lew Koy provides much clarity to the point in
contention herein. In the first place, the statutory provisions such as in
ss. 377 and 379 are plain in their language which do not stipulate that nonproduction in court divests the court of the jurisdiction to hear and try the
criminal proceedings. The true source of legal authority is the factual
existence of the authorisation or permission granted by the Public
Prosecutor. Strictly it cannot be dependent on whether or not the said
instrument of authorisation or permission is produced in court.

C

D

E

[46] Secondly, only in a situation where there is a challenge that the
instrument of appointment ought to be shown. Even then it is only required
to be produced to the court, not the accused. In this case, as stated earlier,
despite the notice of motion only praying for the production of the letter of
permission, the applicant claimed that he was challenging the locus of Datuk
Haji Sulaiman in his conduct of the prosecution against the applicant as the
accused.
[47] But the applicant did not clearly state the reasons for the purported
challenge. There were no allegations for instance of lack of qualification, or
non-fulfilment of the statutory requirements of s. 379 on the part of Datuk
Haji Sulaiman. In fact, the premise for the alleged challenge was precisely
the non-production of the letter of permission.

F

G

[48] Herein lies the incoherence arising from the circularity of the
argument of the applicant. The import and purport of the application, in
truth, in essence and substance sought merely to compel production of the
letter only because the respondent had refused to do so. The refusal, in the
erroneous view of the applicant, went to the jurisdiction of this court. There
was really nothing more than that.

H

[49] There was otherwise no true challenge. And this would simply not do.
The law does not compel production to the court or to the accused of the
instrument of appointment of the individual having conduct of the
prosecution granted under s. 377 and s. 379 merely because the accused asks
for the same. It must be grounded on specifically identified causes which
should be averred in the affidavit of the applicant supporting the application.
None however has been shown in the instant case.

I

[50] At the risk of repetition, I therefore hold that the respondent ought to
only show to the court (and in appropriate cases if ordered by the court, to
the accused as well), the instrument of the letter of permission under s. 379



230

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

of the CPC if there is a valid challenge that Datuk Haji Sulaiman did not have
the authority in writing of the Public Prosecutor to appear in court and
conduct the proceedings.

A

The Specificity Of The AG Media Release
[51] The fact of the absence of a real or valid challenge is further fortified
by another key reason which is this. It was the AG media release which made
public the appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman under s. 379 of the CPC. The
AG media release had already specified the statutory basis for the
appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman. But the instant application said nothing
about any possible defects on the legal basis of the appointment or nonqualification of Datuk Haji Sulaiman under the statutory provision, other
than questioning the issue of locus arising purely from the non-production.
[52] Furthermore, if the complaint was only to have sight of the instrument
of appointment, I fail to appreciate why the AG media release could not be
accepted by the applicant as providing the requisite and definitive
confirmation of the same.
[53] Crucially, unlike the cases, some of which were referred to earlier,
where a challenge was made as to the authority of the person having conduct
of the prosecution, in the instant case, the situation was completely different
since the Public Prosecutor himself, the one and only person in this country
constitutionally empowered to make the decisions on institution and conduct
of prosecution and also the one having the authority to make the appointment
under s. 379 of the CPC has made it official and public the fact of the
appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman. The AG media release also contained
the reasons for the appointment and the choice of the advocate.
[54]

B

C

D

E

F

The relevant paragraph of the AG media release states the following:

3. Accordingly, in the exercise of my discretion under Section 379 of the
Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”), I have appointed Datuk Haji
Sulaiman bin Abdullah to lead the prosecution in PP v. Najib Razak. Datuk
Sulaiman is one of the nation’s leading barristers, having substantial
experience in criminal law, including white-collar crime. His eloquence is
unmatched, and his intellect second to none. Datuk Sulaiman has
impeccable integrity, and is a principled lawyer.

[55] In my view, there can therefore be no valid basis to challenge that a
person having conduct of the prosecution does not have the authority or
permission in writing of the Public Prosecutor because particularly in this
instant case, the AG media release dated 31 August 2018 had made it crystal
clear that the Public Prosecutor has appointed Datuk Haji Sulaiman under
s. 379 of the CPC to lead the prosecution in this case.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

231

[56] I must also mention that the AG media release was issued by the
Attorney General’s Chambers and stated in the AG media release to be the
statement of the Public Prosecutor himself. A copy of the AG media release
was introduced in this proceedings by way of an exhibit to the very affidavit
of the applicant himself which was affirmed on 23 November 2018 in
support of this application. There are no averments in any of the affidavits
of the applicant that could be construed as challenging the authenticity or
even the contents of the AG media release. Any protest expressed at the
hearing by the lead counsel for the applicant against reliance on the AG
media release cannot therefore be characterised by any other than being
somewhat spurious.
[57] The AG media release does not of course constitute the requisite fiat
under s. 379 of the CPC. The instrument of the letter of permission is
undoubtedly the one, but crucially, no less than the appointing authority,
namely the Public Prosecutor has made it publicly known by way of an
official public announcement in the AG media release that he had made the
appointment for the purpose and under the legal provision as stated in the
AG media release.
[58] In contrast, in the cases referred to by the applicant where the
production of the instrument of appointment was ordered by the court, the
challenge was made given the suspicion on the lack of authority of the person
having conduct of the prosecution in the sense that there were doubts whether
the persons who appeared to prosecute (other than Deputy Public
Prosecutors) actually were authorised by the Public Prosecutor.
[59] But in the instant case, the Public Prosecutor had pre-empted any
possible doubts by stating in the AG media release that the person in question
had been appointed by him under the law as specified. This alone, unlike the
other cases, would have been more than sufficient to notify everyone, the
applicant included, that the person in question did have the authorisation
granted by the Public Prosecutor.
[60] Why then would the letter still need to be produced in that situation?
This is befuddling. In fact, the Attorney General himself as the Public
Prosecutor had in the instant case appeared in person to conduct the
prosecution of this case when the first four charges were registered, a few
weeks before the issuance of the AG media release.
[61] Indeed, if similar press release were to be issued in situations where
non-DPPs appeared in court, there would be absolutely no basis for an
accused or his counsel to doubt the existence of the requisite authorisation.
Most if not all of these other cases are obviously without the benefit of any
official public announcement by the Public Prosecutor as to the status of the
appointments.



232

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[62] Of course this is not to say that the appointment in that situation is
therefore immune from challenge. The point is that the complaint can no
longer, because of the AG media release, be formulated by reason of whether
the person was actually authorised in terms of whether a written permission
was in his possession. Instead the challenge should more properly be on
whether the authorisation said to have been made was effected in accordance
with the law.
[63] But as I have stated earlier, it would have been open for the applicant
to mount a challenge on the appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman on the
ground of, say, that it had not been correctly made pursuant to the provisions
of s. 379 of the CPC, being the law invoked by the Public Prosecutor as had
been made plain to all and sundry in the AG media release. Again however,
I stress that there was no such challenge raised by the applicant in the instant
case.
[64] Despite knowing the basis of the appointment as stated in the AG
media release, the applicant did not move to set out the reasons why it was
flawed. Instead the attack made was merely for the production of the
instrument. This, as has been stated more than once earlier in this judgment,
is wholly insufficient, if not patently untenable. In the instant case, there was
no such challenge.
Official Secrets?

A

B

C

D

E

[65] The respondent further resisted production on another ground. That
the instrument of appointment had been classified as official secret under the
Official Secrets Act 1972.
[66] Thus, the applicant would not be entitled to be given a copy of Datuk
Haji Sulaiman’s letter of appointment as an advocate to lead the prosecution
under s. 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
[67] The contents of the letter could also not therefore be reviewed until
and unless it is declassified. The respondent also produced a certificate under
s. 16A of the Official Secrets Act 1972 (“the OSA”) which certified in effect
that Datuk Haji Sulaiman's letter of appointment had been classified as an
official secret.
[68] In accordance with s. 16A of the OSA, one Encik Noor Mohd Huzaila
bin Abdul Majid who is the Director of Management Division, Attorney
General’s Chambers, and who is charged with the responsibility relating to
the administrative affairs of the Attorney General’s Chambers issued a
certificate that the official document relating to the appointment of Datuk
Haji Sulaiman, to lead the prosecution in this case is classified as an official
secret under the OSA.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

233

A

[69] The respondent submitted that the Government has the right to decide
and direct what information is to be classified as official secrets and be kept
away from public knowledge, drawing in support the decision of the Federal
Court in Lim Kit Siang v. Public Prosecutor [1979] 1 LNS 47; [1980] 1 MLJ
293, in particular from the following passage:

B

The defence accepted that the details of any tender exercise and of the
successful outcome constitute secret official information caught by the
Act. It did not contend otherwise at the appeal before us. The secret
nature of the information is obvious. No issue lies as to the nature of such
information. In any event, Government must surely have the undoubted
right to decide what information it would keep from the public. Such
information would be official secrets and would be caught by the Act.

C

D

E

[70] The respondent also argued that the power to declassify official secrets
lie with the person authorised to do so under s. 2C of the OSA and any other
party including the court cannot usurp this power (see the Court of Appeal
decision in Menteri Tenaga, Air dan Komunikasi & Anor v. Malaysian Trade
Union Congress & Ors [2012] 9 CLJ 858).
[71] The respondent is therefore strongly resisting production of the letter
of appointment on the basis of a certificate issued on 6 December 2018 by
the Director of Administration Department of the AGC under s. 16A of the
OSA which sought to classify documents relating to the appointment of
Datuk Haji Sulaiman as official secrets. Section 16A reads:
16A. Certificate by a public officer to be conclusive evidence

F

G

A certificate by a Minister or a public officer charged with any
responsibility in respect of any Ministry, department or any public service
or the Menteri Besar or the Chief Minister of a State or by the principal
officer in charge of the administrative affairs of a State certifying to an
official document, information or material that it is an official secret shall
be conclusive evidence that the document, information or material is an
official secret and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground
whatsoever.

[72] Section 16A of the OSA is thus clear in providing that upon the
issuance of the certificate, the documents so classified cannot be questioned
in any court on any ground whatsoever.
H

[73] The applicant on the other hand maintained that mere and bare
assertion of secrecy would not be sufficient. The respondent must
substantiate the claim of secrecy with evidence in support.

I

[74] In this case, reliance on the certificate issued under s. 16A of the OSA
which sought to classify documents relating to the appointment of Datuk Haji
Sulaiman could be questioned because the affidavit by the respondent did not
clearly demonstrate the exact ambit of the said director’s office, authority or
accountability to qualify the Director of the Administration Department of
the AGC to be deemed as a public officer within the meaning of the OSA
to entitle him to issue the s. 16A certificate in the first place.



234

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[75] Further, it was submitted that by the very purpose of the letter of
appointment or the authorisation in writing under s. 377(b)(1) of the CPC or
permission in writing under s. 379 of the CPC, the instrument in question
could not fall within the ambit of “national security, defence and
international relations” or “relating to the public service”, within the
meanings ascribed to those phrases in the OSA.
[76] This, added the applicant, was especially a concern since even the
AGC is not listed as being part of the public services in art. 132(1) of the
Federal Constitution. Article 132(4) of the Federal Constitution further
excludes the Attorney General (being the Public Prosecutor) from being an
officer or member of the public services.
[77] Whilst the competing arguments on the effects of classification of
documents as official secret under the OSA are usually compelling as they
are weighty and deserving of a critical analysis, in this case, in my view, it
is unnecessary for me to consider and determine whether the respondent
could also validly rely on this s. 16A certificate (which had classified the
instrument of appointment of Datuk Haji Sulaiman under s. 379 of the CPC
as an official secret) to refuse production of the same, in view of the other
reasons that I have stated earlier.
Conclusion
[78] This application is bereft of reasons which are sufficiently cogent to
justify production of the instrument of appointment. Nor did it satisfactorily
explain how the applicant would be prejudiced by the non-disclosure of the
said letter of appointment. The view of the applicant that the risk of the trial
being nullified by reason of non-production constitutes the prejudice is
tenuous and lacking in merit.
[79] Significantly, the argument that the non-disclosure or non-production
meant the absence of locus on the part of Datuk Haji Sulaiman which in turn
would affect the jurisdiction of this court, and risk any proceedings be held
to be a nullity, is too speculative, and in any event has been shown earlier
in this judgment to be flawed.
