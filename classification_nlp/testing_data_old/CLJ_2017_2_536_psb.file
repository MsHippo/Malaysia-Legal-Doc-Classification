The appellant’s land was acquired pursuant to s. 8 of the Land Acquisition
Act 1960 (‘the Act’). The Land Administrator awarded a compensation sum
of RM2,238,972 to the appellant but the latter objected against the said sum.
The matter was referred to the High Court and with the aid of two assessors,
the Judicial Commissioner (‘the JC’) awarded a compensation sum of
RM1,153,444.42. Dissatisfied, the appellant filed the present appeal. The
respondent raised a preliminary objection and submitted that the Court of
Appeal was not seized with the jurisdiction to hear the matter as the ladder
to the next level by way of appeal must be expressly given by law; such right
could not be implied or inferred because ss. 40D(3) and 49(1) of the Act have
expressly precluded the right of appeal in the matter. The appellant argued
that the decision of the High Court was appealable under s. 49(1) of the Act
as it involved a question of law and not the award of compensation. The main
plank of the appellant’s argument was that the JC and the two assessors erred
when they dismissed the appellant’s claim for compensation due to injurious
affection but allowed the claim for severance.

Held (upholding preliminary objection; striking out appeal with costs)
Per Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) Section 67 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (‘the CJA’) provides
that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals
from any judgment order of any High Court in any civil cause or matter;
whether made in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction.

However, appeals to the Court of Appeal are restricted by s. 68 of the
CJA which provides that no appeal lies in cases where, inter alia, by any
written law for the time being in force, the judgment or order of the High
Court is expressly declared to be final. (para 20)
(2) The appeal concerned alleged inadequacy of compensation awarded by
the High Court. Sections 40D(3) and 49(1) of the Act expressly provide
that the judgment or order of the High Court in respect of the amount
of compensation awarded is final and there shall be no further appeal to
a higher court on that matter. The statutory words in the said sections
are plain and unambiguous. Therefore, the Court of Appeal is bound to
construe them in their natural and ordinary sense. The appellant was
precluded from appealing against the order of compensation issued by
the High Court. The High Court was the final arbiter for the amount of
compensation payable under the Act. The appeal was nothing more than
an attempt to circumvent ss. 40D and 49(1) of the Act which preclude
any party from appealing against the award of compensation. (paras 21,
24, 25, 27 & 29)
(3) Injurious affection and severance damage are closely-related to each
other as both relate to (i) the land retained by a person after the other
land is acquired from the person; and (ii) a reduction of value of retained
land. (para 31)

Tanah perayu diambil bawah s. 8 Akta Pengambilan Tanah 1960 (‘Akta’).
Pentadbir Tanah mengawardkan pampasan berjumlah RM2,238,972 kepada
perayu tetapi perayu tidak bersetuju dengan jumlah tersebut. Hal perkara ini
dirujuk pada Mahkamah Tinggi dan dengan bantuan dua orang penilai,
Pesuruhjaya Kehakiman (‘PK’) mengawardkan pampasan berjumlah
RM1,153,444.42. Tidak berpuas hati, perayu memfailkan rayuan ini.
Responden membangkitkan bantahan awal dan menghujahkan Mahkamah
Rayuan tidak berbidang kuasa membicarakan hal perkara ini kerana langkah
untuk ke peringkat seterusnya melalui rayuan mesti diperuntukkan dengan
jelas bawah undang-undang; hak tersebut tidak boleh disiratkan atau
disimpulkan kerana ss. 40D(3) dan 49(1) dengan jelas menghalang hak
merayu terhadap hal perkara ini. Perayu mendalihkan bahawa keputusan
Mahkamah Tinggi boleh dirayu di bawah s. 49(1) Akta kerana melibatkan
persoalan undang-undang dan bukan award pampasan. Teras utama dalihan
perayu adalah bahawa PK dan dua orang penilai terkhilaf apabila menolak
tuntutan perayu terhadap pampasan berasaskan kesan mudarat tetapi
membenarkan tuntutan ganti rugi pemecahan.

Oleh Mohd Zawawi Salleh HMR menyampaikan penghakiman
mahkamah:
(1) Seksyen 69 Akta Mahkamah Kehakiman 1964 (‘AMK’)
memperuntukkan bahawa Mahkamah Rayuan berbidang kuasa
mendengar dan memutuskan rayuan-rayuan terhadap perintah
penghakiman mana-mana Mahkamah Tinggi dalam apa-apa kausa atau
hal perkara sivil; sama ada dalam penjalanan bidang kuasa asal atau
rayuan. Walau bagaimanapun, rayuan-rayuan ke Mahkamah Rayuan
dihadkan oleh s. 68 AMK yang menyatakan rayuan tidak boleh difailkan
terhadap kes, antara lain, yang ditetapkan oleh undang-undang berkuat
kuasa bahawa penghakiman atau perintah Mahkamah Tinggi ternyata
diisytiharkan muktamad.
(2) Rayuan ini berkenaan ketidakcukupan pampasan yang diawardkan oleh
Mahkamah Tinggi. Seksyen 40D(3) dan 49(1) Akta jelas
memperuntukkan bahawa penghakiman atau perintah Mahkamah Tinggi
bersangkutan jumlah pampasan yang diawardkan adalah muktamad dan
tiada rayuan lanjut di mahkamah yang lebih tinggi bagi hal perkara ini.
Perkataan-perkataan statutori dalam seksyen-seksyen tersebut jelas dan
tidak kabur. Oleh itu, Mahkamah Rayuan terikat untuk mentafsir
perkataan-perkataan tersebut dalam makna biasa dan semula jadinya.
Perayu terhalang daripada merayu terhadap perintah pampasan oleh
Mahkamah Tinggi. Mahkamah Tinggi adalah pemutus akhir jumlah
pampasan yang perlu dibayar di bawah Akta. Rayuan ini tidak lain satu
helah untuk memintas ss. 40D dan 49(1) Akta.

Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:
The Antecedent
E

F

[1]
This was an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the learned
Judicial Commissioner (“JC”) in respect of a land acquisition matter. On
21 December 2015, the learned JC, aided by two assessors, made the
following award:
Total land area acquired by
the respondent

:

44900 sq meters

The unencumbered portion

:

[2]
The learned JC also ordered that interest of 8% per annum be paid on
the additional compensation sum awarded pursuant to s. 48 of the Land
Acquisition Act 1960 (‘the Act’).
[3]
Being dissatisfied with the decision, the appellant has now appealed to
this court.

Background Facts
[4]
The background facts of the case may be shortly stated as follows. The
appellant’s land, described as GM17277, Lot 701, Mukim Paya Rumput,
District of Melaka Tengah, Melaka, was subjected to acquisition under the
Act for the purpose of “Tapak Pencawang Masuk Utama”.
[5]
The said land was gazetted for acquisition pursuant to s. 8 of the Act
vide Warta Kerajaan Negeri Melaka No. 484 dated 21 August 2014. The land
concerned was part of an estate land known as Ladang Bertam. The total land
area of Lot 701 was 7.7926 hectares (77926 sq meters) and the land area to
be acquired was 44900 sq meters.

A

B

C

[6]
In the mid-section of Lot 701 was a Tenaga Nasional Bhd (“TNB”)
rentice measuring 5,365.73 sq meters. TNB only acquired a right of way on
part of Lot 701. The right of way was registered on 30 April 2002.
[7]
The Land Administrator conducted an enquiry pursuant to s. 12 of the
Act to determine the amount of compensation payable to the appellant. At
the conclusion of the enquiry, the Land Administrator awarded
compensation in the sum of RM2,238,972.00.
[8]
On 11 December 2014, the appellant objected to the amount of
compensation awarded by the Land Administrator by filing form N,
requesting the Land Administrator to refer the matter to the court for its
determination pursuant to s. 38 of the Act.
[9]

D

E

The appellant raised the following arguments in support of its claim:

(a) The Land Administrator was wrong to award compensation on the basis
that the land concerned was part of estate land;

F

(b) The acquisition of the land has injurious effect on the appellant’s
remaining land. The building of the Tapak Pencawang Utama would
lower the value of the remaining land; and
(c) The acquisition will result in the appellant having no access road to the
appellant’s other lands.

G

[10] As alluded to earlier, the learned JC heard the land reference with the
aid of two assessors pursuant to s. 40A of the Act.
[11] In his judgment at pp. 21 - 22 of the record of appeal, the learned JC
had this to say:
12. Hence, the two assessors are of the view that the land should be
valued as agriculture land with development potential. A reading of
section 40D(1) of the LAA shows that the assessors have the
discretion to choose the comparable for purposes of preparing their
respective opinion on the land value for me to value. All that is
required from them is to make adjustments based on the features
of the subject land shown by the evidence in this case.

B

Hartawan Development Sdn Bhd v.
Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Melaka

541

13. On the issue of injurious effect to the applicant as a result of the
acquisition, I concur with the two assessors that there exist none.
Although the acquisition is intended for purposes of erecting “Tapak
Pencawang Masuk Utama” as declared in the gazette Notification,
the TNB transmission lines and rentice have been in existence on
the land prior to the acquisition (see page 6 paragraph 1 and
Appendix V of the Applicant’s Valuation Report). This has already
caused the value of the land to diminish. Therefore, the submission
that the building of the Tapak Pencawang Utama will lower the
value of the remaining land is therefore, a non-starter.
…

C

15. On the issue of severance of Lots 703 and Lot 492, the assessors
are of the view that compensation is due.

D

16. This Court also orders that the Respondent do all things necessary
to grant right of way to the applicant to their lands affected by the
acquisition to be carried out within 3 months thereof with an
extension of two additional months as the case may be.

E

17. As a Judge hearing a land reference matter with two assessors
appointed pursuant to section 40A of the LAA, my role is to decide
on the issue of law and facts which include the admissibility of
evidence. The issue of land value is strictly for the two assessors to
give their opinion at the end of the hearing.
18. In the proceedings before me, the two assessors having conferred
with each other arrived at the same opinion on the value of the
land. That being the case, I am bound to accept their unanimous
decision on the value of the lands.

The Appeal
[12] The appeal came up for hearing on 21 June 2016. At the outset of the
appeal, learned Assistant State Legal Advisor (“ASLA”) appearing for the
respondent raised a preliminary objection and contended that this appeal was
not maintainable and this court did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter
in view of the provisions of s. 40D(3) and the proviso to s. 49(1) of the Act
and the notice of appeal filed by the appellant ought to be struck out in
limine.
[13] Learned ASLA urged upon us that there can be no right of appeal
unless it be specifically provided for and that without statutory conferment,
the right cannot lie. He submitted further that the ladder to the next level by
way of appeal must be expressly given by law and such right cannot even be
implied or inferred. Section 40D(3) and proviso to s. 49(1) of the Act have
expressly precluded the right of appeal in the matter concerned. (Koriah Sudar
v. Pentadbir Tanah Kuala Langat [2013] 5 CLJ 571).



542

Current Law Journal

[2017] 2 CLJ

[14] Learned counsel for the appellant readily conceded that the appellant
was precluded from appealing against the amount of compensation awarded
by the court below. However, learned counsel posited that in this instant
appeal, the decision of the High Court was appealable under s. 49(1) of the
Act as it is involved a question of law and not the award of compensation
simpliciter. The main plank of the argument of learned counsel was that the
learned JC and two assessors erred when they dismissed the appellant’s claim
for compensation due to injurious affection but allowed the claim for
severance and fixed it at 10% of the market value of the affected lands. In
fact, the appellant had abandoned the claim for severance. Therefore, they
must have mistaken the claim for injurious affection as severance.

A

B

C

[15] In support of his submission, learned counsel referred us to the
following cases:
(i) Bertam Consolidated Rubber Co Ltd v. Pemungut Hasil Tanah, Seberang Perai
Utara, Butterworth [1988] 1 LNS 176; [1989] 2 MLJ 178; and

D

(ii) Malakoff Bhd & Anor v. Pentadbir Tanah, Kedah [2004] 1 CLJ 189; [2004]
1 MLJ 569.
[16] Learned counsel concluded his submission by arguing that the
appellant was entitled to compensation due to injurious affection as follows:
(a) market value - RM67 per sq metre;

E

(b) Diminution in value at 10% - RM6.70 per sq metre;
(c) Land area for remaining portion of Lot 701 and of 698, 893, 700 & 5248
- 223,89. sq metre; and
(d) Amount of compensation - RM1,500,069.70.

F

Our Decision
[17] The preliminary objection raised by the respondent was whether this
court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It is trite that once jurisdiction is
challenged, the court may not decide on the merits of the case without first
determining whether it has jurisdiction over the subject matter. (Pentadbir
Tanah Daerah Seberang Perai Tengah & Anor v. Bagan Serai Housing Estate Sdn
Bhd [2016] 8 CLJ 846 (CA)).
[18] Translated from the Latin, “jurisdiction” means “the power to speak
the law” (From uris, ius-meaning “law” - and dicere - meaning “to speak”).
It confers upon the court the power to decide any matter in controversy. It
pre-supposes the existence of a duly constituted court with full control over
the subject matter under consideration. It pre-supposes full control by the

court of the parties to the subject matter under adjudication. Jurisdiction
defines the power of a court to inquire into facts, to apply the relevant law,
to make decisions and to declare the final outcome of the subject matter
under its inquiry. (Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2010] 7 CLJ 397; Asean
Security Paper Mills Sdn Bhd v. Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance (Malaysia) Bhd
[2008] 6 CLJ 1; Tan Sri Eric Chia Eng Hock v. PP [2007] 1 CLJ 565; Sia Cheng
Soon & Anor v. Tengku Ismail Tengku Ibrahim [2008] 5 CLJ 201; Taylor
v. Lawrence [2002] 2 All ER 353).
[19] Under our legal system, the superior courts are established under
art. 121 of the Federal Constitution. The jurisdiction of the Federal Court
and Court of Appeal is defined by both the Federal Constitution and the
Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (revised 1972) (“CJA 1964”) while that of the
High Court is defined only by the CJA 1964.
[20] Under s. 67 of the CJA 1964, the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to
hear and determine appeals from any judgment or order of any High Court
in any civil cause or matter, whether made in the exercise of its original or
of its appellate jurisdiction. Appeals to the Court of Appeal are, however,
restricted by s. 68. The section provides that no appeal lies in the following
cases:
(a) where the amount or value of the subject-matter of the claim
(exclusive of interest) is less than two hundred and fifty thousand
ringgit except with the leave of the Court of Appeal;
(b) where the judgment or order is made by consent of parties;

F

(c) where, the judgment or order relates to costs only which by law are
left to the discretion of the High Court except with the leave of the
Court of Appeal; and
(d) where by any written law for the time being in force, the judgment
or order of the High Court, is expressly declared to be final.
(emphasis added).

G

H

[21] Sections 40D(3) and 49(1) of the Act expressly provide that the
judgment or order of the High Court in respect of the amount of
compensation awarded is final and there shall be no further appeal to a higher
court on the matter.
[22] For ease of reference, we reproduce below the relevant statutory
provisions under ss. 40D and 49 which specifically deal with appeals in
respect of land acquisition. Subsections 40D(1), (2) and (3) of the Act state
as follows:
Decision of the court on compensation

I

40D (1) In a case before the Court as to the amount of compensation or
as to the amount of any of its items the amount of compensation to be
awarded shall be amount decided upon by the two assessors.



Current Law Journal

544

[2017] 2 CLJ

(2) Where the assessors have each arrived at a decision which differs from
each other then the Judge, having regard to the opinion of each assessor,
shall elect to concur with the decision of one of the assessors and the
amount of compensation shall be the amount decided by that assessor.
(3) Any decision made under this section is final and there shall be no
further appeal to a higher court on the matter.

[23]

A

B

Section 49(1) of the Act stipulates that:

Any person interested, including the Land Administrator and any person
or corporation on whose behalf the proceedings were instituted pursuant
to section 3 of the appeal from a decision of the court to the Court of
Appeal and to the Federal Court.

C

Provided that where the decision comprises an award of compensation
there shall be no appeal therefrom. (emphasis added)

[24] We are of the considered view that the statutory words stated above
are plain and unambiguous. Therefore, we are bound to construe them in
their natural and ordinary sense and give effect to Parliament’s expressed
intent. It is not for the court to rewrite the law and encroach into the
jurisdiction of the Legislature. Lord Diplock pithily encapsulated this in
Duport Steels Ltd v. Sir [1980] 1 WLR 142 157B - 158C:
Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it
is not for the judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse for failing
to give effect to its plain meaning because they themselves consider that
the consequences of doing so would be inexpedient, or even unjust or
immoral.

[25] The judicial interpretation of the above provisions by the Federal
Court in the case of Calamas Sdn Bhd v. Pentadbir Tanah Batang Padang [2011]
5 CLJ 125 clearly shows that the High Court is the final arbiter for the
amount of compensation payable under the Act. The appellant is, therefore,
precluded from appealing against the order of compensation issued by the
High Court. There is a plethora of Court of Appeal cases to that effect, to
name but a few: Jitender Singh Pagar Singh & Ors v. Pentadbir Tanah Wilayah
Persekutuan & Another Appeal [2012] 2 CLJ 165, Koriah Sudar v. Pentadbir
Tanah Kuala Langat (supra), Ng Chin Chai v. Pentadbir Tanah Segamat & Other
Appeals [2016] 4 CLJ 693.
[26] It is also pertinent to note that whilst precluding the right of appeal
against the order of compensation issued by the High Court, there are four
new sections introduced by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 1997
with came into force on 1 March 1998. These sections are intended to
provide clearer provisions for assessing values of lands compulsorily
acquired. When an objection in regard to compensation is referred to the
court, the judge hearing a land reference shall appoint two assessors to assist
and aid the judge who inter alia look into the valuation report and/or any
expert evidence before coming to a fair compensation. The requirement for

the judge to be guided by the assessors is warranted as the judge is not an
expert in land valuation. Therefore, the opinion of the assessor is deemed
necessary. The intention of the Parliament could be gleaned from the
following excerpt at p. 4 of the Parliamentary Hansard dated 15 May 1997:

orang penilai yang akan dilantik oleh hakim yang berkenaan. Seorang
daripadanya adalah merupakan penilai swasta yang berdaftar di bawah
‘Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents Act 1981’, sementara seorang lagi
adalah merupakan penilai kerajaan.

E

Seksyen 40B pula menetapkan bahawa adalah menjadi keperluan undangundang bagi kedua-dua penilai yang dilantik untuk hadir ke Mahkamah
apabila diarah. Setiap penilai swasta yang dilantik oleh hakim akan dibayar
fee sebanyak tidak melebihi daripada RM500 sehari dan tindakan disiplin
boleh diambil ke atas penilai yang gagal hadir di Mahkamah tanpa alasan
yang munasabah di bawah akta yang berkenaan.

F

Sementara seksyen 40C pula memperuntukkan supaya pendapat keduadua penilai tersebut berhubungan dengan apa-apa perkara mengenai
pampasan hendaklah diberikan secara bertulis dan hendaklah juga
direkodkan oleh hakim.

G

H

I

Seksyen 40D memperuntukkan bahawa keputusan Mahkamah berhubung
jumlah pampasan hendaklah berdasarkan jumlah yang diputuskan oleh
kedua-dua penilai yang dilantik. Walau bagaimanapun, dalam keadaan di
mana pendapat kedua-dua berbeza, maka hakim berkenaan hendaklah
memilih salah satu daripada jumlah nilaian yang dilantik dan jumlah
pampasan yang akan di ‘award’ hendaklah merupakan jumlah yang
diputuskan oleh penilai berkenaan. Apa-apa keputusan yang dibuat di
bawah seksyen ini adalah muktamad.

[27] The critical question in this instant appeal, one to which we presently
turn, is whether the decision of the court below is appealable under s. 49(1)
of the Act as it involves a question of law. In our view, this instant appeal
in substance pertains to the alleged inadequacy of compensation awarded by
the High Court. Therefore, in essence, the appellant is challenging the award
of compensation decided by the assessors. With respect, the contention of
learned counsel for the appellant that this instant appeal involves a question
of law flies on the face of the appellant’s notice of appeal. The appellant’s
notice of appeal dated 4 January 2016 states as follows:

AMBIL PERHATIAN bahawa Perayu, HARTAWAN DEVELOPMENT
SDN BHD yang tidak berpuas hati dengan sebahagian keputusan Y.A.
Dato’ Mohd. Fairuz bin Jaffril, Hakim, Mahkamah Tinggi Malaya di
Melaka yang diberikan pada 21 Disember 2015, merayu ke Mahkamah
Rayuan terhadap keputusan tersebut yang memerintahkan bahawa:
(a) …

A

B

(b) Tidak ada pampasan u ntu k penj ej asan terbabit (inj u rious
affection) bagi tanah-tanah Lot 701, 698, 893, 700 dan 5248.
(emphasis added).

[28] This was reinforced by the appellant’s memorandum of appeal dated
7 March 2016, which states at para. 3 as follows:

C

Pesuruhjaya Kehakiman yang bijaksana dan penaksir-penaksir
tersilap ... kerana gagal mempertimbangkan bahawa baki Tanah
terlibat dan Lot 698, 893, 700 dan 5248 mengalami penjejasan
terbabit (injurious affection) akibat pengambilan sebahagian
tanah daripada Tanah terlibat. (emphasis added).

D

[29] Adverting to the grounds of judgment of the learned JC, it is clear that
the issue of injurious affection as a result of the requisition has been duly
considered by the two assessors. The two assessors were in agreement that
the TNB transmissions lines and rentice have been in existence on the said
lands prior to the acquisition and had already caused the value of the said
lands to diminish. Therefore, the diminution in the value of the said lands
was not a direct result of the acquisition.

E

[30] We entertained no doubt that this instant appeal was nothing more
than an attempt to circumvent the salient provisions of ss. 40D and 49(1) of
the Act which precludes any party from appealing against the award of
compensation.

F

[31] Before we conclude, it is pertinent to note that “injurious affection”
and “severance damage” are closely related to each other. Both “injurious
affection” and “severance damage” relate to the land retained by a person
after the other land is compulsorily acquired from the person. Both relate to
a reduction of value of retained land. In Re McCain and City of Saint John
(1965) 42 DLR (2d) 164, Ritchie JA said at p. 181:

G

Severance, in my opinion, is a form of injurious affection.

Conclusion
[32] For the reasons stated above, we upheld the preliminary objection
raised by the respondent. In the result, we struck out the appeal with costs
of RM5,000 (subject to payment of allocator) and the deposit was ordered
to be refunded to the appellant.
