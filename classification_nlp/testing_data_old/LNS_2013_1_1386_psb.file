All the 3 cases were tried together at the request of the prosecution
with the concurrence of the defence. The aforesaid charges were thus
renumbered and now known as the first, second and third charge
respectively.

Case for the prosecution
SP-11, Hosin bin Senawi, now a lance corporal, then attached at Balai
Polis Seri Kembangan as a member of the Balai’s NKRA Task Force Unit,
was having a drink at Restoren Keluarga Ahmed located at Jalan 2/2,
Serdang Perdana, with his 2 new acquaintances when he heard 4 gun
shots being fired in rapid succession. In the sketch plan exhibit P-40, the
said restaurant is marked “A”.

In response to the said gun shots, PW-2 ran towards the rear of
Restoren Kepala Ikan Chong Heng, shaded in black in the sketch plan P-40.
He saw a male Chinese covered with blood lying on the ground at point “B”
in the sketch plan next to a BMW motorcar. He took about 10 seconds to
6



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

reach point “B” from point “A”. He also saw a male Chinese with white
hair, whom he later identified as the accused, walking towards a silver
coloured motorcar, a Proton Iswara bearing the registration number WKY
5462, parked nearby at point “X1” which he (SP-11) drew in the sketch
plan (herein after referred to as the “WKY 5462 motorcar”).

Next SP11 shouted “polis!”. The accused responded by turning
towards him and pointed a pistol at him. He was about 30 feet away from
the accused. He scampered behind a pinang tree at point “X” (drawn by
him in the sketch plan). However the accused did not open fire at him.
From there he next saw the accused entering into the WKY 5462 motorcar,
took the wheels and slowly moved forward and turning to the right at the
end of the road. SP-11 drew the direction/route taken by the accused in
dotted red ink arrows in the sketch plan. He pursued the accused on foot
through the route he drew in blue ink arrows in the sketch plan.

He crossed path with the accused at the junction at point “C” in the
sketch plan (or at “X2” as drawn by him). At this point he saw the accused
putting his right hand out of the car window holding a pistol and pointing
at him and eventually fired 2 shots at him. At the material time he was on
the right side of the said car, about 15 meters away. He managed to
evade by ducking behind a pillar with a big stone wall at point “X3” (drawn
by him).

The accused proceeded further and finally entered Jalan Utama
heading towards the traffic lights. The accused took the route indicated in
dotted red ink arrows, drawn by SP-11. Meanwhile SP-11 continued to
pursue the accused using the route he drew in blue ink arrows in the
sketch plan.

According to SP-4, the traffic was heavy at Jalan Utama. The
accused stopped his car on account of the traffic. SP-11 who was following
the accused’s car from the rear left saw the accused loading ammunitions
into the pistol’s magazine. H e knocked the rear left window of the

8



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

accused’s car. The accused responded by surging forward, knocking into
several cars on its left and right and finally got stuck at point “D” in the
sketch plan due to the heavy traffic.

The accused then exited his car through the front left car door as the
driver’s side of the car door was squeezed up against another car on its
right. At the material time SP-11 was at the rear left door of the car.
When the accused exited his car, he ran towards the rear right side of the
car. The accused then fired 2 shots at him. He ducked the shots by lying
flat, face down on the ground.

The accused then fled on foot towards Mint Hotel through the exit
road leading to the Kuala Lumpur - Seremban Highway with SP-11 hot at
his heels. At point “E” in the sketch plan he saw the accused stopping a
car driven by a woman. The accused pointed his pistol at the woman
driver and simultaneously knocking the glass window of the car door to
force the woman to open the car door. Occasionally the accused also
pointed his pistol at SP-11 who was then at the rear right side of the

9



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

women’s car. At about the same time L/Corporal Benard and P/Constable
Rashid arrived at the scene. L/Corporal Benard then shouted at SP-11 to
shoot the accused. It was at this point of time that the woman fled the
scene with her car.

When SP-11 told Benard and Rashid to run as the accused was
armed with a real pistol, Bernard repositioned himself behind the accused
and Rashid sheltered himself behind the road railing. Now SP-11 found
himself face to face with the accused. He was about 9 feet away from the
accused. Both were pointing their pistols at each other. SP-11 was armed
with a 9mm Walther P99 AS pistol, exhibit P.30(C). SP-11 then ordered
the accused to put down his pistol but was ignored.

When Bernard again shouted at SP-11 to shoot the accused, the
accused turned towards Bernard and pointed his pistol at Bernard. Fearing
that he might shoot Bernard, SP-11 open fire, hitting the accused on his
right thigh. The accused fell and all 3 rushed in, grappled with accused

10



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

and finally apprehended the accused. SP-11 proceeded to seize the
accused’s pistol from the accused

The said pistol is a 9mm Stoeger Couger 8000 bearing the serial
number T-6429-07-05766, exhibit P-8(B). Its magazine is exhibit P-8(C).
The 8 live bullets in the said magazine are P-8(D)(1 to 8).

The first charge (case No. 45B-14-2011)
On a charge under s. 302 of the Penal Code, the business of the
prosecution is to prove:i.

the death of the deceased, Lee Fah;

ii.

that the deceased died due to the injuries sustained by him;

iii.

that the death of the deceased was occasioned by the act or conduct
of the accused; and

iv.

that the act by which the accused caused such death was done:

11



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

a.

With the intention of causing death; or

b.

With the intention of causing bodily injury as the accused knew
to be likely to cause the death of the person whom the harm
was caused; or

c.

With the intention of causing bodily injury to the person, and
the injury intended to be inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary
cause of nature to cause death; or

d.

With the knowledge that the act was so imminently dangerous
that it must in all probability cause death and commits such act
without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or
such injury as aforesaid.

(i)

the first ingredient - the death of the deceased, Lee Fah
It is my factual finding that there is no issue as regards to the death

of the deceased. The body of the deceased was identified by the I.O of
the case, SP-12. The deceased’s wife Madam Lim Swee Moi, SP-10, also
identified the body of the deceased. The pathologist, SP-7, confirmed that
on 30.6.2010 he had conducted a post mortem examination on the body of

12



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

the deceased. The defence also did not dispute that the deceased had
died.
(ii)

the second ingredient - the deceased died due to the injuries
suffered by him
The full report of the pathologist’s (SP-7) examination is exhibit P-36.

The pathologist testified that the deceased had suffered 9 external injuries,
all related to gun-shot wounds. The details are at page 2 of exhibit P-36.
There were 4 gun-shot entry wounds and 2 gun-shot exit wounds. He
explained further in his testimony, in his own words for purposes of
clarity:“Luka tembak keluar pada pangkal hidung tengah-tengah berbentuk
bintang berukuran 1cm x 1cm. Bola mata kanan pecah. Lebam pada
kelopak mata kanan atas dan bawah. Luka tembak masuk pada
pelipis kanan berukuran 0.9cm x 0.9cm, terdapat kelim lecet di
sekelilingnya. Luka tembak masuk pada sudut dagu kanan bawah
telinga kanan berukuran 3cm x 1.2cm. Luka tembak keluar pada
bahu kanan berukuran 2cm x 1.2cm agak ke depan. Luka tembak
masuk pada pangkal lengan atas kanan belakang 1cm diameter
dengan kelim lecet di sekelilingnya. Luka tembak masuk pada rusuk
kanan belakang pada garis ketiak belakang sama tinggi dengan
ketiak berukuran 1cm diameter”.

13



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

His internal examination revealed the following, again in his own
words:“Tulang tengkorak dan otak baik. Tulang C2 pecah dan ditemukan
anak peluru di situ. Pangkal larinks di bawah pita suara pecah. Tisutisu lunak di belakang asefagus di daerah T2 terdapat tembus dan di
kelilingi lebam. Terdapat lebam pada tulang selangka kiri dan satu
anak peluru utuh ditemui di situ. Pemeriksaan dada terdapat kesan
patah pada tulang rusuk ketiga kanan pada garis ketiak belakang.
Terdapat pendarahan pada rongga dada kanan. Kesan tembus pada
lob atas paru-paru kanan. Pemeriksaan jantung dalam keadaan baik.
Dalam abdomen tiap-tiap satu organ dalam keadaan baik.”

The pathologist concluded by saying:“Terdapat 4 luka tembak masuk dan 2 luka tembak keluar dan 2
anak peluru dijumpai. Luka nombor 7 keluar pada luka nombor 6
dan masuk semula pada luka nombor 5 dan berakhir pada tulang C2
dan satu anak peluru ditemui di situ. Luka nombor 4 adalah luka
tembak masuk ke pelipis kanan, menembusi bola mata kanan dan
keluar pada luka nombor 1. Luka nombor 8 menembusi tulang rusuk
kanan ketiga, lob atas paru-paru kanan, daerah belakang trakea di
hadapan tulang T2 dan ke atas tulang selangka kiri dan satu anak
peluru ditemui di situ. Jarak tembak adalah jarak jauh. Arah tembak
adalah dari depan bawah kanan ke kiri atas belakang. Oleh itu saya
simpulkan bahawa kematian disebabkan luka tembak. Luka tembak
mengakibatkan pendarahan yang banyak pada bahagian paru-paru
dan daerah pita suara. Akibatnya darah banyak keluar dan
menyebabkan kematian. Menyebabkan heomorrhage shock dan
14



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

kekurangan darah. Kekurangan oksigen dan menyebabkan semua
organ tidak boleh berfungsi. Ini adalah sebab-sebab kematian dia”.
Earlier, in response to a question as to how many shots were fired he said,
again in his own words:“3 kali. Pertama masuk ikut pelipis ke bola mata dan keluar ikut
batang hidung. Kedua masuk ikut lengan kanan keluar ikut bahu
kanan dan masuk balik melalui dagu kanan dan berakhir di dalam
peti suara. Ketiga peluru masuk ikut rusuk kanan belakang dan
masuk dalam rongga dada menembusi paru-paru kanan kemudian
menembusi trachea dan asefagus dan berakhir di bawah tulang
selangka kiri dan tersangkut di situ. Jumpa 2 anak peluru - (i) di peti
suara; (ii) di bawah tulang selangka kiri.
The 2 bullet slugs referred to by SP-7 are exhibits P-15(H)(i) and P15(H)(ii) respectively.

In my view SP-7’s findings were sound and his explanation cogent.
His testimony was uncontroverted. The defence did not mount any real
challenge regarding to the causative factors leading to the death of the
deceased. I have thus no reason to disagree with SP-7 in terms of the

15



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

cause of the death of the deceased. Hence it is my factual finding that the
deceased died because of the gun shot injuries inflicted upon him.

(iii) the third ingredient - the death of the deceased was
occasioned by the act of the accused.
The evidence of the complainant, SP-11
The testimony of SP-11, is most relevant. His evidence revealed that
at point “B” in the sketch plan he saw the accused walking away from the
deceased lying motionless on the ground next to a BMW motorcar bearing
registration number WTJ 1446 (hereinafter referred to as the “BMW
motorcar”) as shown in the photographs exhibits P-21(2), (3), (4) and (5),
towards a silver coloured Proton Iswara motorcar bearing the registration
number WKY 5462 parked nearby at point “X1” (herein after referred to as
the “WKY 5462 motorcar”). When SP-11 shouted “polis” at the accused,
the accused turned towards him and pointed a pistol at him.

16



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Next the accused entered the WKY 5462 motorcar and moved forward. At
point “X2” or “C” in the sketch plan, again the accused pointed his pistol at
SP-11 and shot him twice, forcing SP-11 to duck behind a pillar with a
stone wall.

From point “C” the accused entered the main road, Jalan Utama. His
car came to a stop due to the heavy traffic. He surged forward when SP11 knocked the rear right door of his car and finally got stuck at point “D”.
Upon disembarking from his car at point “D”, the accused again targeted
his pistol towards SP-11 and fired 2 more shots at SP-11.

Thereafter the accused fled on foot and took the slip road leading to
Kuala Lumpur - Seremban Highway. Finally at point “E” in the sketch plan,
he was shot on his thigh in the most dramatic fashion by SP-11 and got
arrested by SP-11 and his colleagues soon after.

17



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

SP-11’s evidence was unshaken and equally uncontroverted, devoid
of infirmities that could erode his credit-worthiness. I have no reason to
disbelieve his account of what happened and accepted his factual
narratives enumerated above. Hence the conduct of the accused in fleeing
the scene upon being accosted by SP-11 very soon after SP-11 heard the 4
gun shots and firing at SP-11 at point “C” and “D” in the sketch plan, is
relevant and squarely falls under the ambit of s. 8(2) of the Evidence Act,
1950. The accused indeed harboured some serious explanation to account
for his conduct with reasonable fullness of details and circumstance under
s. 9 of the same Act - see Parlan bin Dadeh v. PP [2009] 1 CLJ 717 at pp
746 and 747, para 36.

The evidence of the head of the police forensic team, SP-9
SP-9, examined the BMW motorcar and the deceased sprawling on
the ground covered with blood next to the said car at point “B” in the
sketch plan as shown in the photographs exhibit P-21(1), (2), (3), (4), (5)
and (6). When he arrived, the scene was already secured by a policeman.

18



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

SP-9 found a slug/bullet fragments embedded at the rear view mirror
on its rear side of the said car as shown in the photographs exhibit P21(16) and (17). Otherwise the said motorcar was intact with no other
damages. The said slug/bullet fragments are exhibits P-14(K2) and P14(K3) respectively.

Next at Hospital Serdang, SP-9 met the accused being treated in the
Emergency Ward. The I.O of the case, SP-12, was there too. He
examined the accused’s palms and found the same to be covered with
dried glue as shown in the photographs exhibits P-21, (22), (23), (26),
(27). He removed the said glue from the accused’s palms by pulling the
glue as shown in exhibits P21(28), (29), (30), (31) and (32). The traces of
glue removed from the accused’s palms are exhibits P-15(F)(i) and P15(G)(i) respectively.

SP-9 next proceeded to examine motorcar WKY 5462 at Jalan Utama,
Sri Kembangan, at point “D” in the sketch plan. The scene was already
secured by the police when he arrived.

19



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

He found a bullet slug at the rear of the said car. He marked it with
number 2, shown in exhibits P-21(34) and (36). This bullet slug is exhibit
P-15(E)(i). He also recovered another slug near the driver’s side of the
car door, which he marked with number 3, shown in exhibits P-21(34), (36),
(38), (40) and (41). This bullet slug is exhibit P-15(C)(i). From inside the
said car, SP-9 found a bullet casing on the floor board of the driver’s seat.
He marked it with number 4 and shown in photographs P-21 (44) and (45).
This bullet casing is exhibit P-15(D)(i).

SP-9 also found a “100 Plus” drink can he marked number 5, a pink
towel he marked number 6, a plastic bottle containing yellowish liquid he
marked number 7, a bottle of glue bearing the “Dunlop” brand-name he
marked number 8, a knife in sheath he marked number 9, a pair of
“Crocodile” shoes he marked number 10 and a patch of false hair (toupee)
he marked number 11, all shown in the photographs P-21(43), (44), (45),
(46), (47), (48), (49), (50) and (51).

20



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Most importantly SP-9 also recovered a Smith & Wesson .38 revolver
in a folded piece of newspaper on the floor board of the front passenger
seat of the said car which he marked number 12 and shown in
photographs P-21(42), (43), (48) and (51). Inside the revolver’s chambers
he found 3 live bullets and 3 bullet casings, shown in photograph P-21(54).
The revolver is exhibit P-12(B), the 3 live bullets are P-12(C)(1, 2 and 3)
and the 3 bullet casings are P-12(D)(1, 2 and 3).

SP-9 also recovered a plastic packet containing 4 photographs he
marked number 13, shown in P-21(42), (43), (48), (51) and (56).

Additionally SP-9 also recovered the registration plate numbers
bearing the number WKT 4582 affixed beneath the plate numbers WKY
5462 at the front and rear of the said car. The registration number WKY
5462 as seen by SP-11 and seen initially by SP-9 affixed over the number
WKT 4582 and shown in the photograph P-21(33), (34), (35), (36) and
(38) are both false registration numbers as testified by the I.O of the case,
SP-12.

21



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

PW-9 also went and examined the scene at point “C” in the
sketch plan. He did not find anything incriminating though.
The evidence of the I.O, SP-12
The I.O testified that no Proton car was ever registered under the
number WKY 5462. Instead a motorcycle was officially registered under
the said number. The engine number of the said car also did not exist in
JPJ’s registration system. Meanwhile the chasis number of the said car
originally belonged to a Proton Saga Aeroback motorcar bearing the
original registration number WLF 4226.

The I.O also testified that the road tax of the said car carried the
number WKT 4582. He investigated the same and confirmed that a
motorcar carrying the registration number WKT 4582 does exist,
belonging/registered under one Hoe Wee Shiong of No. 130, Taman Sri
Kenaboi, Titi, Jelebu, Negeri Sembilan. The said motorcar WKT 4852 was
in the possession of the said Hoe Wee Shiong at the material time and the

22



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

said Hoe Wee Shiong had not loaned the said car to anyone. The I.O

the accused was unknown.

The evidence of the chemist, SP-6
Now, the 2 bullet slugs recovered by SP-7 from the person of the
deceased [exhibits P-15(H)(i) and P-15(H)(ii)]; the 9mm Stoeger Couger
8000, its magazine and 8 live bullets therein seized by SP-11 from the
accused [exhibits P-8(B), P-8(C) and P-8(D)(1 to 8)]; the Smith & Wesson .
38 revolver, the 3 live bullets and 3 bullet casings recovered from its
chambers seized by SP-9 from inside the motorcar WKY 5462 [exhibits P12(B), P12(C) (1, 2, 3) and P12(D)(1, 2, 3)]; the 2 bullet slugs recovered
by SP-9 outside the motorcar WKY 5462 [exhibit P-15(E)(i)and P-15(C)(i)];
and the bullet casing recovered by SP-9 from the floor board of the driver’s
seat in motorcar WKY 5462 [exhibit P-15(D)(i)] were sent to the Chemistry
Department by the I.O of the case for ballistic, serviceability, DNA and Gun
Shot Residue (GRS) examinations. There were other items sent but not
relevant as yet for our discussion presently.

These exhibits were examined by the chemist, SP-6 who was then
the Ketua Unit Senjatapi dan Kesan Alat, Seksyen Kriminalistik, Bahagian
Forensik, Jabatan Kimia Malaysia, Petaling Jaya.

SP-6 testified that both the Smith & Wesson revolver [exhibit P12(B)] hereinafter referred to as the “said revolver”) submitted to him was
serviceable. He also testified that there were traces of gun powder residue
in the barrel of this revolver. It showed that the said revolver had been
used to discharge bullet shots and had not been cleaned after the shots
were fired.

SP-6 further confirmed that the revolver [exhibit P-12(B)] is a .38
Special Smith & Wesson MOD 15-3 and the 2 bullet slugs (exhibit P15(H)(i) and P-15[(H)(ii)] recovered from the person of the deceased are
also .38 Special bullet slugs.

[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Using the 5 rounds of .38 Special live bullets supplied by the police,
SP-6 test fired the said revolver and found the said revolver [exhibit P12(B)] to be serviceable capable of discharging a shot or bullet by means
of an explosive charge. The 5 spent bullet casings used in his tests are
exhibits P-17(A)(1 to 5) and the 5 slugs therefrom are exhibits P-17(A) (6
to 10).

He examined and compared these 5 casings and 5 slugs with the 2
slugs recovered from the deceased’s persons [exhibits P-15(H)(i) and P15(H)(ii)] and the 3 casings [exhibit P-12(D)(1, 2 and 3)] recovered from
the chambers of the said revolver P-12(B). He found the following:(i)

the characteristics/features of the 3 bullet casings exhibit P-12(D)(1,
2, 3) matched (“sepadan” - term used by SP-6) with the
characteristics/features of the 5 bullet casings exhibit P-17(A)(1 to 5)
and

(ii)

the characteristics/features of the 2 bullet slugs exhibit P-15(H)(i)
and P-15(H)(ii) matched (“sepadan”) with the characteristics/features
of the 5 bullet slugs exhibits P-17(A)(6 to 10).

25



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

From the above findings, SP-6 concluded the following:(i)

that the 3 bullet casings exhibit P-12 (D)(1, 2, 3) were
discharged/fired from the revolver exhibit P-12 (B); and

(ii)

that the 2 bullet slugs exhibit P-15(H)(i) and P-15(H)(ii) recovered
from the person of the deceased were also discharged/fired from the
revolver P-12(B).

SP-6 also confirmed that he examined the Stoeger Couger pistol
exhibit P-8(B). He confirmed that there were traces of gun powder residue
in the barrel of the said pistol indicating that the same had been used to
discharge shots or bullets and had not been cleaned after the bullets were
fired.

SP-6 also test fired the said pistol using 5 rounds of 9mm live bullets
supplied to him by the police. He found the said pistol exhibit P-8(B) to be
serviceable capable of discharging a shot or bullet by means of an
explosive charge. The 5 spent bullet casings used in his tests are exhibits

26



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

P-16(A)(1 to 5) and the 5 bullet slugs therefrom there are exhibits P16(A)(6 to 10).

Next SP-6 examined and compared the 5 said bullet casings and 5
bullet slugs with the bullet casing exhibit P-15(D)(i) found by SP-9 on the
floor board of the driver’s seat of motorcar WKY 5462 and the bullet slug
exhibit P-15(E)(i) (SP-6 termed it as “pecahan jaket peluru”) found by SP-9
at the rear of motorcar WKY 5462. He found:(i)

the characteristics/features of the bullet casing P-15(D)(i) matched
with the characteristics/features of the 5 bullet casings exhibits P16(A)(1 to 5); and

(ii)

the characteristics/features of the bullet slug exhibit P-5(E)(i)
matched with the characteristics/features of the 5 bullet slugs
exhibits P-16(A)(6 to 10).

From the aforesaid findings, SP-6 again concluded that:-

27



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

(i)

Legal Network Series

the bullet casing P-15(D)(i) was fired/discharged from the Stoeger
Couger pistol exhibit P-8(B); and

(ii)

the bullet slug P-15(E)(i) was fired/discharged from the same pistol
exhibit P-8(B).

I have no reason to disagree with the findings of SP-6 enumerated
above. He is most professional in his work and appeared to be very
competent in his field of expertise. He had years of experience behind him
and his testimony in respect of the same suffered no apparent infirmities to
invalidate his credibility as an expert on the matter in issue. Neither were
his findings really challenged by the defence. Hence I have no reservation
in accepting his evidence and find as a fact that the said revolver exhibit P12(B) was serviceable at the material time of the incident and still is; that
the 3 bullet casings exhibits P-12(D)(1, 2, 3) were discharged/fired from
the revolver P-12(B); and that the 2 bullet slugs exhibit P-15(H)(i) and P15(H)(ii) that occasioned the death of the deceased were also discharged
from the revolver P-12(B).

28



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Equally it is also my unequivocal findings that the bullet casing P15(D)(i) found by SP-9 from the floor board of the driver’s seat of motorcar
WKY 5462 and bullet slug exhibit P-15(E)(i) found by SP-9 at the rear of
the said motorcar were both discharged from the same pistol Stoeger
Couger exhibit P-8(B).

Did the accused discharge the fatal shots at the deceased?
As reiterated earlier SP-6 confirmed that the 3 bullet casings [exhibit
P-12(D)(1, 2, 3)] found inside the chambers of the revolver exhibit P-12(B)
were discharged from the said revolver. It meant 3 shots were fired. SP-6
also confirmed that the 2 bullet slugs [exhibit P-15(H)(i) and P-15(H)(ii)]
retrieved from the person of the deceased that occasioned his death were
discharged from this same revolver exhibit P-12(B). In such event, in my
view the testimony of SP-6 thus established beyond doubt that this
revolver P-12(B) was the firearm used to cause the death of the deceased.

29



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

SP-7 testified that the deceased died due to gunshot wounds and he
was shot 3 times. The findings of SP-6 relating to the said 3 bullet casings
found inside the chambers of the revolver exhibit P-12(B) is consistent with
SP-7’s findings that the deceased was shot 3 times. The recovery of the
said 2 bullet slugs from the person of the deceased also confirmed that the
deceased was factually shot at and is also consistent with SP-7’s findings
relating to the entry wounds and exit wounds as well as the trajectory of
the said bullets upon entering the deceased’s person and the causative
factors causing or leading to his death. In all probability the third bullet
were the bullet fragments [exhibit P-14(K2) and (K3)] that got stuck at the
back of the rear view mirror of the BMW motorcar after the said bullet had
exited the deceased’s person through the bridge of his nose, as was
testified by SP-7.

In the light of the forensic evidence enumerated above, the
contradiction in SP-11’s evidence that he heard 4 gunshots while having his
drink at point “A” in the sketch plan would assumed little relevance. It is
no ground to bring down the whole of the prosecution’s case.

30



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Hence the corresponding issue is whether it was the accused who
had fired/discharged the fatal shots at the deceased using the said revolver
P-12(B). In my view there is no direct evidence to that effect. However
although the accused was never seen by SP-11 to have handled or used
the said revolver at point “B” or elsewhere, the circumstantial evidence is
overwhelming that the fatal shots were fired by the accused using the said
revolver exhibit P-12(B), crystalised as follows gathered from the
testimonies of SP-11, SP-9, SP-7 and SP-6 -

-

while at point ”A” in the sketch plan SP-11 heard 4 gunshot
explosions fired in rapid succession;

-

SP-11 reached point “B” in about 10 seconds after he heard the
gunshots;

-

at point “B”, SP-11 saw the deceased slumped on the ground next to
a BMW motorcar and the accused walking towards motorcar WKY
5462. SP-11 shouted “polis”.

31

the accused turned towards SP-11 and pointed the Stoeger Couger

pistol exhibit P-8(B) at him (SP-11);

-

the accused entered into motorcar WKY 5462 and fled the scene with
SP-11 in hot pursuit;

-

at point “C” the accused shot SP-11 twice using the said pistol P8(B).

-

the accused’s car came to a complete stop at point “D”.

-

upon emerging from his car at point “D” the accused again shot SP11 twice using the same pistol P-8(B).

-

the accused was finally subdued by SP-11 and his colleagues at point
“E” and the said pistol P-8(B) was seized from him by SP-11;

-

the said motorcar WKY 5462 was under the control and custody of
the accused at all material times until the accused abandoned the
said motorcar at point “D” in the sketch plan.

-

both the accused hands/palms were covered in glue;
32



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

-

Legal Network Series

the said revolver P-12(B), with 3 live bullets [P-12(C)(1, 2,3)] and 3
bullet casings [P-12(D)(1, 2, 3)] in its chambers was recovered on
the floor board of the front passenger seat of the said motorcar WKY
5462 which was under the control and custody of the accused;

-

there were traces of gun powder residue in the barrel of the said
revolver P-12(B), indicating that the said revolver had been used to
discharged bullet shots;

-

the 3 bullet casings P12(D)(1, 2, 3) were discharged from the said
revolver, P-12(B);

-

the 2 bullet slugs retrieved from the person of the deceased were
discharged from the said revolver P-12(D).

In my view when the combined strength of each of the pieces of
evidence enumerated above is taken and considered together there can be
only one conclusion to be arrived at ie, that it was the accused who had
fired and shot the deceased using the revolver P-12(B).

33



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

At point “B” the accused was seen moving away from the deceased
and walking towards his car WKY 5462. This was about 10 seconds after
SP-11 heard the gunshots. The accused turned towards SP-11 and pointed
his pistol at SP-11 after SP-11 shouted “polis”. The conduct of the accused
as such is relevant under s. 8(2) of the Evidence Act, 1950. In my view
there is absolutely no reason for the accused to conduct himself in such an
aggressive fashion if he has no part in the shooting of the deceased.
Equally there is no reason for him to flee the scene and in the process
shooting at SP-11 at point “C” and “D”. There is also no reason for him to
continually fleeing the scene beyond point “D” until being forcibly subdued
by SP-11 and his colleagues. Needless to say, the conduct of the accused
belied his innocence.

Additionally the said revolver P-12(B) and the contents of its
chambers were found in motorcar WKY 5462 driven by the accused. The
accused drove the said car to flee the scene. At all material times the said
car was under his custody and control. Equally at all material times the
said revolver was apparently under his custody and control until the
34



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

accused abandoned the said car at point “D” in the sketch plan. There is
no evidence that there were other people with the accused in the said car
before the accused abandoned the said car. It was the testimony of SP-11
that the accused was the only person he saw at point “B”. It was also the
uncontroverted testimony of SP-11 that the accused was alone in the said
car at all material times until the accused abandoned the said car. The
pink towel [exhibit P-11(E1)] recovered by SP-9 from inside the said car
carried the accused’s DNA as testified by SP-5. Both SP-9 and SP-11
testified that both the accused palms were covered in glue and a bottle of
glue [exhibit P-11(C1)] was recovered from inside the said car.

There is also no evidence that the said car WKY 5462 and its
contents as recovered by SP-9 had been tampered with before the arrival
of SP-9. The evidence of SP-9 is uncontroverted that the car and its
vicinity were secured by the police when he arrived at the scene to
examine the said car.

35



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

The evidence of SP-14 is also uncontroverted that he secured the
said car WKY 5462 and its vicinity with 2 other police officers, P/C Muzamil
and P/C Rizal, at about 7.10 p.m. and handed the same to the police
forensic team upon their arrival at about 12.10 a.m on 29.6.2010.
Additionally SP-15 testified that he arrived and secured the location and its
vicinity where the deceased was shot at about 7.05 p.m. upon instruction
of the Ketua Polis Balai Sri Kembangan until the arrival of the police
forensic team headed by SP-9.

The recovery of the said revolver P-12(B) in motorcar WKY 5462 so
soon after SP-11 heard the gunshot explosions, the conduct of the accused
before fleeing the scene upon being accosted by SP-11, the conduct of the
accused after fleeing the scene until being forcibly subdued by SP-11, the
factum that there were traces of gun powder residue in the barrel of the
said revolver P-12(B), the factum that the 3 bullet casings [P-12(D)(1, 2,
3)] were discharged from the said revolver P-12(B), the factum that the 2
bullet slugs [P-15(H)(i) and P-15(H)(ii)] retrieved from the person of the
deceased were discharged from the said revolver P-12(B), the factum that

36



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

the said motorcar WKY 5462 was at all material times under the control
and custody of the accused, the factum that the said revolver was at all
material times under the control and custody of the accused and the
factum that there was no one else apart from the accused at point “B” and
inside the said car before the accused abandoned the said car at point “D”,
only led to the irresistible conclusion that it was the accused who had shot
the deceased 3 times using the said revolver P-12(B). It is my specific
finding of fact that the totality of the cumulative effect of the series of
circumstances and coincidences enumerated above as testified by SP-5,
SP-6, SP-7, SP-9 and SP-11 when considered in the aggregate, pointed
only to the irresistible conclusion that it was the accused who had
occasioned the death of the deceased and no one else - see Idris v. PP
[1960] MLJ 269; Chan Chuen Kong v. PP [1962] MLJ 307; Sunny Ang v.
PP [1966] 2 MLJ 195; Mohd Abbas Danus Baksan v. PP [2006] 3 CLJ
880.

The intervening 10 seconds before the arrival of SP-11 at point “B”
accorded the accused more than enough time to switch firearms and in all

37



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

the circumstances of the case it could safely be inferred that the accused
had switched the firearm he used to shoot the deceased with another to
point at SP-11 before the arrival of SP-11 at point “B”.

It is immaterial that the deceased did not suffer instant death. It is
equally immaterial that the deceased could have survived the gun shots
had he been given prompt and proper medical treatment. In this
connection Explanation 2 to s. 299 of the Penal Code is relevant and
obviously applicable. The said Explanation provides that “…. Where death
is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall
be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper
remedies and skillful treatment, the death might have been prevented ….”
Hence it is of no consequence that the deceased was still alive when SP-11
spotted the deceased at point “B” where he heard the deceased breathing
heavily.

The fourth ingredient - the intention of the accused
Intention is a state of mind. It is incapable of being calibrated unless

expressed in so many words. As such it is next to impossible to gauge
one’s intention. Hence in the absence of an express admission, the
intention of the accused is a matter for the court to infer from the act or
conduct of the accused from the proven set of facts or circumstances
before, during or after the occurrence of a particular event or incident. In
short the intention of the accused is a matter of inference from what he
did.

However, on a charge under s. 302 of the Penal Code, it is the
business of the prosecution to prove that the act of the accused leading to
the demise of the deceased comes within the ambit of any one or a
combination thereof, of the situations as envisaged by s. 300(a), (b) (c) or
(d) of the Penal Code.

39



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

In my view, upon the facts and evidence adduced, the provision of
s. 300(a) is most relevant. It provides:“300. Except in cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is
murder:
(a)

if the act by which the death is caused is done with the
intention of causing death;”

In respect of the law relating the said s. 300(a), his Lordship Jeffrey
Tan J (as he then was) in PP v. Abdul Razak Dalek [2006] 4 CLJ 129 at p.
156-157, at para 53 and 54 stated:“[53]. In relation to intention under the first clause of s. 300, Ratanlal &
Dhirajlal, ibid at p. 1296 - 1297 commented as follows:The first clause of s. 300 enacts that culpable homicide is murder if
the act by which death is cause is done with the intention of causing
death… An intention to kill a person brings the matter so clearly
within the general principle of mens rea as to cause no difficulty.
Such intention however, must be found as a matter of fact. It is
distinct from presumed or constructive intention. The accused also
cannot be found guilty from the knowledge of the consequences of
the act. At the same time, however it is equally true that intention is

40



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

a subjective element and in most of the cases direct proof of
intention is not forthcoming. It has rightly been said that the devil
himself knows not the thought of man. A man’s intention is a
question of fact and it can be gathered from his acts. In deciding the
intention of the accused, the court may consider the nature of the
weapon used, the part of the body of the victim chosen by the
accused for attack the number of blows administered, the force used
by the assailant, etc.”
[54] In Virsa Singh, the Supreme Court stated:
To determine what the intention of the offender is, each case must
be decided on its own merits. Where it is proved that the accused
fired a gun shot at such close range that it could not have had other
than a fatal effect and it is indicative of the intention of the accused
that after firing at one person he reloaded the gun and fired a shot at
another person there is a clear indication of his intention to commit
murder. Where a person fires two shots successively at another
person, his murderous intention is clearly evident. The law looks as
regards intention to the natural result of the man’s act and not to the
condition of his mind. From a legal point of view a person intends
whatever he gives others reasonable grounds for supposing that he
does intend. Where a man strikes lath blows on the head of the
deceased mercilessly and practically kills him on the spot, he is guilty
of murder. Where a man stabs another in a vital part, he must be
41



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

held to have intended to cause death, and if death ensues either
directly from the wound or in consequence of the wound creating
conditions which gave occasion to the appearance of a fatal disease,
the person inflicting the wounds is guilty of murder. Absence of
premeditation will not reduce the crime of murder to culpable
homicide not amounting to murder….”

In this case before me the accused fired 3 shots in rapid succession
at the deceased at least from 1 meter away from the deceased as testified
by SP-7. By firing the 3 shots, the accused must have intended to occasion
the death of the deceased. It is indicative of the accused’s murderous
intention. The accused must have known the consequences of shooting
the deceased 3 times in rapid succession. As stated by the Supreme Court
of India in Virsa Singh, the law looks as regards intention to the natural
result of the man’s act and not to the condition of his mind. Viewed
objectively, the natural consequence of the intentional act of the accused
in shooting at the deceased 3 times is the death of the deceased.

42



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Hence on the facts and evidence it is my specific finding of fact that
the accused intended to cause the death of the deceased by doing what he
did to the deceased.

The intention of the accused to cause the death of the deceased is
further amplified by the fact that he came well prepared to finish his job.
He came with 2 fully loaded firearms, ie, the revolver P-12(B) and the
pistol P-8(B). He applied glue to both his palms, most probably to erase
traces of his fingerprints on both the firearms as well as the motorcar he
was driving and other items recovered therein. Additionally the motorcar
driven by him was fitted with 2 false registration numbers and as stated by
the I.O of the case, the said car does not appear to have existed in JPJ’s
registration system. In addition there was a patch of false hair inside the
said car, most probably for him to disguise himself. In all the
circumstances of the case there can be no doubt that the accused had
planned to execute his intention to murder the deceased in the most
clinical fashion. On all fours the prosecution’s job is done.

43

Legal Network Series

The second charge (case No. 45-15-2011)
Here the accused was charged of the attempted murder of SP-11.
The business of the prosecution is to prove:(i)

that there was an attempt by the accused to cause the death of SP11; and

(ii)

that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence of
the act of the accused.

In Mallal’s Penal Law at p. 515 it is stated … “the mens rea of
intention or knowledge must be present when the offender committed the
act that would have resulted in death, if not for supervening events. The
mens rea must be to cause death, and nothing less. The offender should
have carried out the act to cause death “under such circumstances” that if
death occurred, it would be murder…”

Now the evidence of SP-4 as stated earlier revealed that at point “B”
in the sketch plan, the accused pointed his pistol P-8(B) at SP-11; at point
44



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

“C” the accused fired 2 shots at SP-11 using the same pistol; and at point
“D” the accused fired another 2 shots at SP-11 after alighting from his
car, again using the said pistol P-8(B). Earlier along the way at Jalan Utama
before reaching point “D”, SP-11 saw the accused reloading his pistol’s
magazine. Additionally SP-11 stated that the accused was the only person
inside the said car WKY 5462 at all material times and when the said car
came to a stop at point “D” the accused was the only person who had
alighted from the said car.

I have no reason strong enough to disbelieve SP-11 nor his account
of the course of events. His testimony was cogent and uncontroverted and
did not suffer from lapses nor contradictions in material particulars when
tested against the silent evidence adduced and the evidence of other
prosecution witnesses. Equally his testimony did not melt under the brunt
of cross-examination fiercely mounted by the defence.

45

The testimonies of both SP-6 and SP-9 further established beyond
doubt that the said Stoeger Couger pistol P-8(B) was used by the accused
to shoot at SP-11. The recovery of the bullet slug exhibit P-15(E)(i) within
the vicinity of the said motorcar WKY 5462 at point “D” by SP-9 lend
credence to SP-11’s testimony that he was shot for the second time by the
accused at the place after the accused alighted from the said motorcar.

The testimony of SP-6 that the said pistol P-8(B) is serviceable, that
there were traces of gun powder residue in the barrel of the said pistol P8(B) and that the said bullet slug P-15(E)(i) was fired/discharged from the
said pistol P-8(B) are most relevant and offered the best corroborative
evidence in support of the evidence of SP-11 that he was shot by the
accused at that place by means of the said pistol P-8(B).

Equally the recovery of the bullet casing P-15(D) by SP-9 from inside
the said car and confirmed by SP-6 that the same was fired/discharged
from the said pistol P-8(B) offered the best corroboration that SP-11 was
shot by the accused. This bullet casing which was recovered from inside

46



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

the said car could not have been fired/discharged at point “D” as the
testimony of SP-11 was uncontroverted that he was shot by the accused
after the accused had alighted from his car at point “D”. As such the
casings from the 2 shots discharged from outside the car could only have
been dislodged from the said pistol outside the said car. Hence it is most
probable that the said casing P-15(D) which was recovered from inside the
said car on the floor board of the driver’s seat, was dislodged from the said
pistol P-8(B) when the accused fired 2 shots at SP-11 at point “C” in the
sketch plan, consistent with SP-11’s testimony that he was shot at that
place by the accused from inside the said car while being driven by the
accused.

For all the reasons enumerated above, it is my specific finding of fact
that the accused had indeed fired 4 gun shots at SP-11. By so doing, at
the time of committing the said act, the accused had all the mens rea
(both intention and knowledge) to cause the death of SP-11. The act of
the accused in firing or discharging the 4 gun shots aimed specifically at
SP-11 would have resulted in the certain death of SP-11. Death was
47



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

avoided only because SP-11 was fit, quick and alert enough to ducked the
4 shots fired at him.

In my view on all fours the prosecution had established that the
accused had attempted to cause the death of SP-11 and that such death
was attempted to be caused by the act of the accused in firing/discharging
the 4 gun shots aimed at SP-11.

The third charge (case No. 45-19-2012)
Here the accused was charged under s.3 of the Firearms (Increased
Penalties) Act 1971 of discharging 4 gun shots from the said pistol P-8(B)
at SP-11 with intention to cause the death of SP-11 while committing a
schedule offence ie, preventing his own arrest.

The business of the prosecution under this offence as indicated in
Saw Hong Choy v. PP [2008] 1 CLJ 10 is to prove that:-

48



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

(i)

Legal Network Series

the accused had committed a schedule offence ie, preventing his
own arrest;

(ii)

SP-11 was lawfully empowered to make or execute such arrest; and

(iii) the accused at the time of committing the schedule offence had
discharged the said 4 gun shots at SP-11 with the intention of
causing his death or causing bodily injuries to SP-11 notwithstanding
that no death or hurt is caused thereby.

In this connection the defence did not dispute that SP-11 is a
member of the PDRM. It is also not disputed that at the material time SP11 was attached at Balai Polis Seri Kembangan as a member of the Balai’s
NKRA Task Force Unit whose principal duty is the prevention and
eradication of serious crimes. His powers to effect an arrest without
warrant on any person who has committed a seizable offence as conferred
upon him under s. 23(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code is also not
under dispute.

49



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Additionally it is not disputed that an offence of murder, a nonbailable and seizable offence, was committed and the accused was seen
leaving the scene of the crime and pointed his pistol at SP-11 in response
to SP-11 shouting “polis” at him. Further it is in evidence that the single
minded purpose of SP-11 in pursuing the accused right from point “B” up
to point “E”, covering a distance of more the 2 kilometers, was to
detain/arrest the accused on account of what he saw at point “B” and the
reaction and subsequent conduct of the accused after being accosted by
him. Being a member of the PDRM there can be no doubt that he was
empowered by law to do so under s. 20(3)(a) of the Police Act 1967
(Revised 1988) and s. 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

It is also in evidence that in response to the said pursuit by SP-11,
the accused reacted by firing/discharging 4 gun shots by means of the said
pistol P-8(B) at SP-11 at point “C” and “D” in the sketch plan. The
uncontroverted evidence of SP-11 shows that the accused had discharged
the said 4 gun shots aimed and directed at him. In such event there can
be no doubt that the 4 gun shots were discharged by the accused to resist
50



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

his own arrest. In my view that is tantamount to committing a Scheduled
offence as provided in the schedule to the Firearms (Increased Penalties)
Act 1971. The body of evidence which I have adverted to and accepted
relating to the discharged of the said 4 gun shots by the accused using the
said pistol P-8(B) are as enumerated in my findings in relation to the
second charge above. I have no wish to have a repetition here.

Hence upon the facts and evidence it is my specific finding of fact
that the accused had indeed discharged the said 4 gun shots by means of
the said pistol P-8(B). Equally it is also my finding that the said 4 gun
shots were discharged by the accused with the intention to prevent his
own arrest by SP-11. Even at point “E” in the sketch plan, the accused
made attempts and persisted to resist his own arrest even though by then
he had been surrounded by SP-11 and his 2 other colleagues.

Additionally the 4 gun shots were aimed and directed by the accused
at SP-11 in his attempt to flee from SP-11. Under such circumstances I
cannot see how it can be contended that the accused did not harbour any

51



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

intention to cause the death of SP-11. It is clear and it is my finding that
the evidence clearly shows that the accused did intend to cause the death
of SP-11 when he discharged the said 4 gun shots from the said pistol
notwithstanding that SP-11 did not suffer death or injuries.

The non calling of Cekok, Zek, L/Corporal Bernard and P/C Rashid
Cekok and Zek were SP-11’s new acquaintances who were already
seated at a table in Restoren Keluarga Ahmed at point “A” in the sketch
plan. SP-11 joined them at their table on account that all the other tables
were occupied by other customers. Meanwhile L/Corporal Bernard and P/C
Rashid arrived at point “E” to assist SP-11 at the point of time when the
accused was forcibly attempting his way into a car driven by a woman.
These 4 witnesses were not called to testify by the prosecution. It was
hence urged by learned counsel that s. 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950
ought to be invoked to operate adversely against the prosecution.

In response to the same, what was stated by Sulaiman Daud HMR in
Yeo Kwee Huat v. PP [2011] 5 CLJ 630 is very apt:“Telah dijelaskan dalam beberapa keputusan kehakiman bahawa
dalam sesuatu perbicaraan jenayah pihak pendakwaan mempunyai
budibicara sama ada hendak memanggil mana-mana saksi tertentu
bagi membuktikan kesnya. Prinsip ini telah ditegaskan sekali lagi
oleh Mahkamah Persekutuan dalam kes Low Kian Boon & AMR v. PP
[2010] 5 CLJ 489; [2010] 4 MLJ 425, yang merujuk kepada kes PP v.
Dato Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (No. 3) supra, di mana Augustine Paul J
(beliau pada masa itu) berkata bahawa dalam perbicaraan jenayah
pihak pendakwaan mempunyai budibicara, dengan syarat tidak ada
motif yang salah, sama ada atau tidak hendak memanggil manamana saksi tertentu dan khususnya mempunyai budi bicara untuk
tidak memanggil bagi menyokong kesnya seorang saksi yang tidak
dipercayai kejujurannya. Dalam kes yang sama telah diputuskan
bahawa tidak timbul apa-apa inference bertentangan hanya oleh
sebab kegagalan memanggil seorang saksi jika terdapat keterangan
lain

Keputusan-keputusan ini nyata selaras dengan seksyen 134 Akta
Keterangan yang memperuntukkan bahawa tiada bilangan tertentu
saksi dikehendaki untuk membuktikan sesuatu fakta. Begitu juga
dalam kes Munusamy v. PP [1987] CLJ 221 (Rep); [1987] 1 CLJ 250;
[1987] 1 MLJ 492, Mahkamah Agong memutuskan antara lain,
bahawa sesuatu inference bertentangan di bawah seksyen 114(g)

akan berbangkit bukan kerana kegagalan mengemukakan seorang
saksi tetapi kerana kegagalan memanggil saksi penting dan
material”.

Hence the corresponding issue would be whether the aforesaid 4
witnesses are essential and material witnesses to unfold the full narrative
of the prosecution’s case. Now, the evidence as reiterated earlier shows
that SP-11 joined both Cekok and Zek only because there were no other
vacant tables in the said restaurant. Equally the testimony of SP-11 is
uncontroverted that both Cekok and Zek did not follow SP-11 to point “B”
nor in the pursuit of the accused all the way to point “E” until the eventual
arrest of the accused. In such event I cannot see how it could be
contended that both Cekok and Zek are essential and material witnesses
relevant to the unfolding of the full narrative of the prosecution’s case. If
both these 2 witnesses were to testify they would not have been capable
of adding further value to both the prosecution and the defence case.

54



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

As regards to L/Corp Bernard and P/C Rashid, their involvement
commenced at point “E” and was confined to assisting SP-11 to apprehend
the accused. If both were called to testify, their evidence would have been
redundant. They would only replicate SP-11’s testimony relating to the
arrest of the accused. In such event there was no necessity for the
evidence of both Cekok and Zek in the narrative of the prosecution’s case.
In any event s. 134 of the Evidence Act provides that no particular number
of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.

Equally it is trite law that the prosecution wield the discretion to call
the witnesses relevant to prove its case or to prove any fact. It is also in
their discretion to decide on the number of witnesses they need to call to
prove any such fact. Additionally, in this case the fact that the accused
was apprehended by SP-11, L/Corp. Bernard and P/C Rashid after he was
shot on his right thigh by SP-11 was not disputed nor challenged by the
defence. Hence there is no necessity to call L/Corp. Bernard and P/C
Rashid on an issue of fact which was not challenged merely to corroborate
SP-11’s testimony over the same.

55



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

In all the circumstances of the case, in my view there are no grounds
cogent enough to warrant the invocation of the adverse inference rule to
operate in favour of the accused as suggested by learned counsel. The
failure to call a particular witness or witnesses by the prosecution does not
per se trigger into motion the adverse inference rule under s. 114(g) of the
Evidence Act. It is not to be invoked liberally. It is only in cases where
there have been deliberate/intentional suppression of material or crucial
evidence that the rule may be invoked - see Dato Seri Anwar bin
Ibrahim v. PP (and Another Appeal) [2003] 4 CLJ 409; PP v. Mansor
B. Mohd. Rashid [1997] 1 CLJ 233; Munusamy v. PP [1987] 1 CLJ 250;
PP v. Chia Leong Foo [2000] 4 CLJ 649 and Tarmizi Yacob & Anor v.
PP & Another Appeal [2010] CLJ 501. Here I am satisfied that there has
not been any deliberate or intentional suppression of crucial and material
evidence on the part of the prosecution by not calling the aforesaid 4
witnesses into the stand. The sufficiency of the prosecution to prove its
case, particularly in respect of the factum of the arrest of the accused, was
amply afforded by the single testimony of SP-11. In any event L/Corp.
Bernard and P/C Rashid were offered to the defence at the end of the
prosecution’s case.

No slugs or bullet casings recovered at point “C” in sketch plan
Learned Counsel submitted that the failure by SP-9 to recover slugs
or casings at point “C” would lend no weight to SP-11’s testimony that he
was shot twice by the accused at point “C”. However, I have deliberated
at length pertaining to the recovery of bullet casing exhibit P-15(D) on the
floor board of the driver’s seat of motorcar WKY 4562 driven by the
accused in the earlier paragraphs and I opined that it is most probable that
this casing was dislodged in the said car when the accused shot SP-11 at
point “C” from inside the said car.

Additionally as reiterated earlier, the testimony of SP-11 was cogent
and uncontroverted that he was shot twice at point “C”. He appeared to
be a truthful witness. I have no reason to treat his testimony with
suspicion nor that his testimony was inherently improbable or incredible.
Hence the failure of the prosecution to recover slugs or bullet casings at
point “C” does not negate the substantive evidence of SP-11 that he was
shot twice by the accused at point “C” in the sketch plan.

The accused’s blood specimen was obtained without his consent
In this connection I accepted the I.O’s evidence that the accused had
consented in writing for his blood specimen to be taken.

Additionally even if there was no such consent the law is trite that
relevant evidence is admissible even though it has been obtained illegally see Ramli bin Kechik v. PP [1986] 1 CLJ 308.

No DNA profiling, finger prints of the accused on motorcar WKY
4562
It is in evidence as testified by SP-9, SP-11 and the I.O of the case
that both hands/palms of the accused was covered in glue. It is also in
evidence that a bottle of glue was found inside the motorcar WKY 4562 by
SP-9. As such it came as no surprise that no DNA could be profiled or
finger print marks lifted to link the accused with the said motorcar or with
the numerous exhibits recovered there from. Equally SP-9 testified that
the glue covering the palms of the accused was designed to prevent the
imprintment of finger print marks or evidence for DNA profiling on items

58



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

touched or held by the accused. However the pink towel exhibit P-11(E1)
recovered by SP-9 from inside the said car carried the accused’s DNA as
testified by SP-5. In any event the evidence of SP-11 that the accused was
the sole driver and occupant of the said motorcar from point “B” to point
“D” in the sketch plan is uncontroverted and damning enough to link the
accused with the said car and the exhibits recovered there from. In such
event the absence of the accused’s finger print or his DNA profile does not
negate SP-11’s testimony that it was the accused who drove the said car
from point “B” to point “D” before he abandoned the said car at point “D”.

Prime facie case
In the event it is my finding that at the end of the prosecution case,
upon a maximum evaluation of the evidence adduced before me, the
prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the accused on the 3
charges as proffered against him within the terms as required in Looi Kow
Chai & Anor v. PP [2003] 1 CLJ 374; PP v. Mohd Radzi bin Abu Bakar
[2006] 1 CLJ 457. Should the accused remain silent upon his defence
being called, the evidence adduced is sufficient to warrant his conviction on
59



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

all the 3 charges. The accused was thus ordered to enter his defence upon
all the 3 charges.

Case for the defence
The accused opted to testify on oath after the 3 modes of mounting
his defence was explained to him.

The accused testified that on 28.6.2010 he was at Taman Cuepacs
having a drink with his friend, Liew Ah Meng (hereinafter referred to as “Ah
Meng”). Next he agreed with Ah Meng’s request to go to South City,
Serdang. They drove there in Ah Meng’s car, a Proton Iswara WKY 5462.
The accused drove the said car. At South City he stopped in front of Kedai
Makan Kari Kepala Ikan Cheong Hin. He got down and bought a can of
100 Plus drink and a bottle of mineral water. Ah Meng was holding a black
“Amway” bag, exhibit P-20.

60



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

The accused then drove the said car to the back of the said Kedai
Makan and parked the said car at bay no. 40, near point “B” in the sketch
plan. A BMW sports car (exhibit P-41) was parked beside the car he drove
at bay no. 41 as shown in the photograph exhibit P-21(2).

Ah Meng then told him that he wanted to see a “Ah Long” as he had
a crisis with the said Ah Long. Ah Meng then showed him the contents of
the Amway bag, which contained 2 pistols. This was about 3.00 p.m. Ah
Meng then got out of motorcar WKY 5462 with the Amway bag and said he
wanted to go and find Ah Long. Ah Meng said he owed Ah Long, a money
lender, a sum of RM20,000.00 and he wanted to settle some issues with Ah
Long.

The accused testified that he was told by Ah Meng to remain in the
car and not to go anywhere. He remained inside the car for 2-3 hours. He
even urinated into a bottle while in the car. He was also told by Ah Meng
to apply glue to his hands which he did.

61



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

At about 5-6 p.m. he saw a well built man walking towards the BMW
motorcar and another man following him. The well built man sat down on
the driver’s seat and the man following him shot him. He heard 3 shots.
He was frightened but he could clearly see and averred that the man had
fallen towards the left of the driver’s seat. The man was not lying on the
tarmac of the car park as shown in the photographs P-21(3) and (4). He
was certain that the man was inside the car.

The accused further testified that the shooter then went to motorcar
WKY 5462 (the car the accused drove) and when he entered the car he
realized it was Ah Meng. This was because Ah Meng was wearing a wig.
He was ordered by Ah Meng to drive away quickly which he did. He went
from point “B” to “C” and stopped at Condo East Lake wherein Ah Meng
got out of the car and told him to drive towards Mint Hotel. Ah Meng did
not take anything from the car and left the Amway bag and the wig in the
car.

62



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

The accused was emphatic that he did not use any pistol to shoot at
anyone at point “C” nor pointing any pistol at anyone at point “C”. He also
said that he did not see SP-11 at point “B” or at “C”, nor point any pistol at
SP-11 at point “B”.

The accused continued that at point “D” he had collided with 3 cars.
He got out of the car and noticed 2 Malay men on a motorbike, with one
pointing a finger at him. He was frightened and got back into the car
again. He took out a pistol from the Amway bag and accidentally
discharged a round while inside the car. He got out of the car. He was
frightened of the people around him and fired a shot into the air. He
added that the person riding pillion on the motorbike was SP-11. He said
that that was the first time he saw SP-11 and that he did not see SP-11 at
any point before point “D”. He did not point the pistol he was holding at
SP-11, but fired upwards towards the sky.

The accused testified that he then proceeded to point “E” where he
tried to stop a Myvi motorcar driven by a women. The car crashed at the

63



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

side. He then stopped a motorbike. While attempting to get up the
motorbike, he felt a sharp pain on his right leg and realized that he was
shot from the back. He fell down and SP-11 then came near him and said
“polis”. SP-11 next kicked the pistol away from his hand and kicked his
face. He lost consciousness and woke up in a hospital.

The accused also testified that he was promised RM300.00 by Ah
Meng, whom he had not seen again since the incident on 28.6.2010. He
has also never used a pistol until the date of the incident. The motorcar
WKY 5462 was not his and he has not taken anything into the car.

Evaluation of the accused’s defence
I am of the view that the defence of the accused is a complete denial
and that the substance of the defence posited by the accused was only
raised for the first time at the defence stage, typical of one who kept his
defence “up his sleeve”. The following were not raised nor suggested to

that after he fell after he was shot, SP-11 came to him and after
saying “polis”, SP-11 proceeded to kick the pistol from his hand
and also kick his face.

The

accused’s

testimony

enumerated

above

formed

the

backbone/crux of the accused’s defence. Nevertheless it was never put to
the prosecution witnesses but only revealed during the defence stage,
leaving no room for rebuttal or explaination or denial by the said witnesses,
in particular SP-11 and SP-12. Indeed it took the prosecution by surprise.

67



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

They were denied the opportunity to verify the veracity of the evidence
given by the accused. Being the crux of his defence, it is only to be
expected that these issues should feature prominently in the crossexamination of SP-11 and SP-12. Hence in Chua Beow Huat v. PP [1970]
2 MLJ, the Sharma J, after quoting an Indian authority, quoted the
following passage:“Mukherji J, in this Indian case said:
“The law is clear on the subject. Wherever the opponent has
declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his essential and
material case in cross-examination, it must follow that he believed
that the testimony given could not be disputed at all. It is wrong to
think that this is merely a technical rule of evidence. It is a rule of
essential justice. It serves to prevent surprise at trial and miscarriage
of justice, because it gives notice to the other side of the actual case
that is going to be made when the turn of the party on whose behalf
the cross-examination is being made comes to give and lead
evidence by producing witnesses. It has been stated on high
authority of the House of Lord that this much a counsel is bound to
do when cross-examining that he must put to each of his opponent in
turn, so much of his own case as concerns that particular witness or
in which that witness had any share. If he ask no question with
regard to this, then he must be taken to accept the plaintiff ’s account

in its entirety. Such failure leads to miscarriage of justice, first by
springing surprise upon the party when he has finished the evidence

The Federal Court in Alcontra a/l Ambross Anthony v. PP (MR) [1996]
1 MLJ 209 at m.s. 218 also adverted to the same issue:Speaking generally, in criminal trial, the whole point and purpose of
the defence having to put its case to such prosecution witnesses as
might be in a position to admit or deny it, is to enable the
prosecution to check on whether an accused’s version of the facts is
true or false, and thus avoid the adverse comment, that the defence
is a recent invention - in other words, “kept up it sleeve,” as it were
revealed for the first time when the accused makes his defence from
the witness box or dock, thus detracting from the weight to be
accorded to the defence”.

Coming back to the case before me, I have thus no hesitation to find that
such failure by the accused to put his case at the earliest possible stage

69



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

would render the same to be likened or branded as a recent invention
incapable to being accorded the due weight it deserves - see also PP v.
Lin Lian Chan [1992] 2 MLJ 561. On the other hand it is very apparent
that the crux of the prosecution’s case as was anchored upon the
testimonies of PW-11, PW-9, PW-7, PW-6 and PW-12 as particularized in
the earlier paragraphs stood uncontroverted even after having gone
through the vagaries of cross-examination.

More importantly, having scrutinized the evidence in its entirety, the
accused does not appear to me to be a credible witness.

Firstly his willful blindness in following the various requests made by
Ah Meng is beyond comprehension. At point “B” Ah Meng told him that he
wanted to see Ah Long to settle some issues, afterwhich Ah Meng showed
him the Amway bag containing 2 pistols and Ah Meng then left the
motorcar to look for Ah Long carrying the 2 pistols in the Amway bag with
him. The accused, in the circumstances under which Ah Meng went
looking for Ah Long and the fact that Ah Meng had told him that he owed

70



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Ah Long, a money lender, the sum of RM20,000.00, must have sensed that
Ah Meng is up to no good. Yet he did nothing. He did not even try to
disassociate himself from Ah Meng. He did not even refrain Ah Meng from
seeing Ah Long armed with 2 pistols. A law abiding reasonable man
similarly circumstanced would not have hesitate to report Ah Meng’s
conduct to the authorities.

Instead the accused blindly followed Ah Meng’s instructions. He
waited in the motorcar for hours and did not get out of the motorcar when
told by Ah Meng to wait in the car and not go anywhere. He even urinated
into a bottle in the motorcar. He applied glue over his hands/palms when
told by Ah Meng to apply glue over his hands/palms. He admitted that he
was not forced by Ah Meng to apply the glue and did not also understand
the need to apply the glue over his hands/palms. At the same time he
knew the effect of applying glue to his palms ie, to prevent imprintments of
his fingerprints on items he touch or hold. Hence what is the glue for if the
accused is only to wait in the motorcar for Ah Meng’s return?

71



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

In all the circumstances of the case, the accused’s conduct in waiting
still in the said motorcar for such long hours to the extent of even urinating
inside the motorcar and in applying glue all over his palms/hands makes no
sense. He did not even ask Ah Meng why the need for him to do so.
Equally the accused did not also offer any explanation to account for his
willful blindness in complying with Ah Meng’s requests.

In such event I am most agreeable with the submission of the
learned TPR that Ah Meng is a figment of the accused’s imagination. He
does not exist. The accused was at point “B” on his own accord waiting for
the right time to strike at the deceased.

Secondly, the accused witnessed the shooter shooting the deceased.
Yet again he did nothing. He did not flee from the scene. He did not
recognize the shooter either. When the shooter entered his motorcar,
again he did nothing. He did not express any fright, concern, fear or
surprise or do something to prevent the shooter from entering the
motorcar. The accused was very cool. Only after the shooter had entered

72



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

the motorcar he realized that the shooter was Ah Meng as the shooter was
then wearing a wig. Again the conduct of the accused in allowing the
shooter, whom he did not recognize then, to enter the motorcar makes no
sense. The shooter was a stranger before he entered the car and the
accused has just witnessed the stranger shooting somebody 3 times. Yet
he allowed the shooter to enter his car without fuss.

Thirdly, upon entering the said motocar Ah Meng told him to leave
the place quickly. Blindly, the accused obliged. He did not say that he was
forced by Ah Meng to do so. Again the accused did not account for his
willful blindness.

Fourthly, the accused said that after the well built man was shot, he
saw that the man had fallen towards the left of the driver’s seat and not
lying on the tarmac of the car park as shown in photographs P-21(3) and
(4). However not a drop of blood was found inside the said motorcar BMW
as testified by SP-9.

73



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

Fifthly, the accused testified that he collided with 3 other cars at
point “D”. However the accused gave no explanation why the collision
occurred or the circumstances surrounding the collision. In such event the
testimony of SP-11 that the accused stopped his motorcar just before point
“D” on account of the heavy traffic and that the accused responded by
surging forward and knocking into 3 other cars and got stuck at point “D”
after he (SP-11) had knocked the rear left window of the said motorcar
appears to be a lot more probable. The accused was in a hurry to flee
upon being accosted by SP-11 after SP-11 caught up with him just before
point “D”.

Sixthly, the accused said that he reentered his car at point “D” after
he got frightened when he noticed 2 Malay men on a motorbike with one
of them pointing a finger at him. The corresponding issue is - what is he
frighten off when the Malay man merely pointed a finger at him?

Once back in the car he said that he took out a pistol from the
Amway bag and accidentally discharged a round inside the motorcar. As

74



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

the pistol was discharged inside the motorcar, the bullet must have hit at
some points or places inside the motorcar. If the said bullet somehow
ricochetted and exited the car, there must be bullet hole or holes from
within the motorcar to show such exit. The evidence of SP-9 who toothcombed the inside and outer side of the said motorcar negated the
presence of exit hole or parts of the inside of the said motorcar being hit
by the said bullet. The testimony of the accused relating to this accidental
discharge found no support from the hard evidence. In fact his testimony
was contradicted by the hard evidence procured from the testimonies of
both SP-11 and SP-9. The presence of the bullet casing on the floor board
of the driver’s seat of the said car singularly on its own, in the absence of
other corroborative evidence is not evidence pointing to the same. Worst
still this issue of accidental discharge of the said pistol inside the car was
never raised in the cross-examination of SP-11 and SP-9. It is apparent
that this issue is an afterthought.

Finally, the accused testified that he did not point his pistol at SP-11
outside the said motorcar and discharged 2 shots at SP-11 at point “D” but

75



[2013] 1 LNS 1386

Legal Network Series

pointed to the sky and discharged a round towards the sky. He said he did
so because many people were looking at him and this frightened him. In
my view his reasons are most ridiculous.

In his own words, the people were merely looking at him. They did
not go or were about to go after his skin. Apparently the people did not
intend to harm him. His life and limbs were never in any danger. Hence
there is no justification at all for him to discharge the said pistol in the
manner he did. Being merely frightened of people looking at him is no
justification to discharge the said firearm. Additionally he claimed that he
has never used a firearm in his life before. However from the manner he
discharged the said pistol it appears that he is very well adept and skilful at
using such pistol. In my view this is another red-herring from the accused.
On the other hand SP-11’s testimony is uncontroverted that the pistol was
aimed, directed and discharged at him twice. Bodily injuries or death was
only avoided because he managed to duck the shots directed at him.

Verdict at the end of the defence case
Having considered the evidence in its entirety, I am wholly satisfied
that the defence posited by the accused is grossly against the weight of
evidence. It is a defence of mere denial laced with elements of
afterthought. He denied shooting the deceased to death. He denied
attempting to murder SP-11 and also denied discharging 4 gun shots from
the said Stoeger Couger pistol at SP-11 with intention to cause his death
while committing a schedule offence, ie, preventing his own arrest by SP11. In the light of the evidence before me, such denial without more is
incapable and is equally insufficient to dislodge the prosecution’s case. It
has not created a reasonable doubt upon which the defence was called see PP v. Ling Tee Huah [1982] 2 MLJ 324; Bala anak Matik v. PP [2006]
3 MLJ 516. The prosecution on the contrary had proven the 3 offences
leveled against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
The accused is thus found guilty and convicted of the 3 offences as
proferred. He is sentenced to hang by rope by his neck until he is dead
according to law in respect of the first and third charges. As regards to the

second charge he is jailed for 5 years to run with affect from the date of
his arrest.
