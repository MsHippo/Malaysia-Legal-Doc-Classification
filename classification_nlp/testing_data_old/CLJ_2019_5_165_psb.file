The appellant, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences committed under the Penal Code, the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 and the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.
Datuk Haji Sulaiman Abdullah (‘DHSA’), an advocate and solicitor, was
appointed by the Public Prosecutor (‘PP’) to lead the prosecution against the
appellant. At the High Court, the appellant sought for the respondent (‘the
prosecution’) to produce a copy of the letter appointment of DHSA.
Dismissing the application, the High Court Judge (‘HCJ’) held (i) the letter
of appointment was not a pre-trial document covered by s. 51 of the Criminal
Procedure Code (‘CPC’) which is only for documents mentioned in the
charge; (ii) there is no legal requirement to produce the letter of appointment
under the CPC and the appellant’s reliance on s. 55 of the Interpretation Acts
1948 and 1967 (‘IA’) and s. 129 of the CPC were misplaced because these
provisions are on the institution of legal proceedings and not on authorisation
or permission to appoint a qualified person to conduct prosecution in the
CPC, such as ss. 377 and 379; (iii) the appellant failed to specifically state
the reasons for the alleged challenge to the appointment of DHSA and the
court could not compel its production solely on the ground that the Attorney
General (‘AG’) refused to produce it; (iv) the AG media release had specified
not just the law under which the appointment was made but also the reasons
for the same. Given that it came from the PP himself, in the person of the
AG, there would not be a need to produce the same in court. The application
also failed to show how the basis of appointment, as stated in the AG media
release, was flawed; and (v) the letter of appointment has been classified as
official secret by the issuance of a certificate under s. 16A of the Official
Secrets Act 1972 (‘OSA’). Hence, the present appeal. The prosecution
abandoned their objection on the production of the letter of appointment
based on the last ground stated above and their objection on the said
production was premised on s. 126 of the Evidence Act 1950 (‘EA’).
Held (allowing appeal; setting aside order of High Court)
Per Rhodzariah Bujang JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) Section 126 of the EA provides three instances when solicitor-client
privilege arises, except where the provisos apply, and they are
(i) communications made by the client to his advocate; (ii) contents of
documents which the advocate has sighted; and (iii) advice given by the
advocate to his client. The qualification is that the three instances must
have occurred in the course of, or for the purpose of, the advocate’s
appointment. (para 10)
(2) Section 126 of the EA applied to the AG and DHSA because, in
appointing the latter to conduct the prosecution against the appellant, the
AG, in his capacity as the PP, was in no different or worst position that
a litigant, be it in a criminal or civil case, who appoints an advocate or

solicitor to advice or represent him in court in the legal dispute
involving him. However, in order to seek refuge under s. 126 of the EA,
the prosecution must show that the letter of appointment comes under
privileged communication which the AG failed to do. Based on the
illustrations to s. 126 of the EA, it is clear that what is protected is
information given by the client to his advocate or solicitor. (para 10)
(3) Since a legal practitioner has been appointed to conduct the prosecution
against the appellant, not a Deputy Public Prosecutor in the
employment of the AG Chambers who is a public servant, the appellant
had a legitimate interest or expectation to have sight of the letter
appointing him to conduct the prosecution, for the criminal justice
system in Malaysia is an adversarial one, and the duty of a prosecutor
to act fairly is paramount. Therefore, it was the bounden duty of the AG
to produce the letter of appointment when such a request has been made
and not only when a specific challenge to that appointment has been
mounted by the appellant, or an accused who is similarly circumstanced,
for he has the right to know, from the start of the proceedings, that his
prosecutor is the one who has been validly appointed under s. 379 of the
CPC. (para 15)
(4) By the clear provision of s. 55 of the IA, the letter of appointment came
within the said section as it was prima facie evidence which is required,
in the words of the section ‘… for any other purpose in connection with
any legal proceedings …’. The scope of s. 55 of the IA is wider than,
and is not merely confined to, the institution of a criminal proceeding.
In other words, there is no difference between the need to produce a
sanction to prosecute before the commencement of a trial and the
production of a letter of appointment made under s. 379 of the CPC for
the conduct of a criminal proceeding in court. This consideration is a
sufficient answer to the point raised by the HCJ that a letter of
appointment is not a pre-trial document required to be produced under
s. 51A of the CPC. (para 15)
(5) The announcement of the appointment of DHSA, during the AG media
release, could not take away the legitimate interest of the appellant to
have sight of the letter of appointment. The AG media release did not
satisfy the AG’s duty as such a document addressed to the world at-large
could not be equated with a formal letter of appointment. (para 18)

Haram 2001. Datuk Haji Sulaiman Abdullah (‘DHSA’), seorang peguam bela
dan peguam cara, dilantik oleh Pendakwa Raya (‘PR’) untuk mengetuai
pendakwaan terhadap perayu. Di Mahkamah Tinggi, perayu memohon agar
responden (‘pihak pendakwaan’) mengemukakan sesalinan surat pelantikan
DHSA. Menolak permohonan tersebut, Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi (‘HMT’)
memutuskan (i) surat pelantikan bukan dokumen pra-perbicaraan yang
termasuk dalam rangkuman s. 51 Kanun Tatacara Jenayah (‘KTJ’) yang
hanya untuk dokumen-dokumen yang dinyatakan dalam pertuduhan;
(ii) tiada kehendak undang-undang agar mengemukakan surat pelantikan
bawah KTJ dan sandaran perayu pada s. 55 Akta Tafsiran 1948 dan 1967
(‘AT’) dan s. 128 KTJ tidak tepat kerana peruntukan-peruntukan ini adalah
tentang pemulaan prosiding undang-undang dan bukan tentang kuasa atau
kebenaran melantik orang yang berkelayakan untuk mengendalikan
pendakwaan dalam KTJ, seperti ss. 377 dan 379; (iii) perayu gagal
menyatakan, dengan khusus, alasan-alasan cabaran terhadap pelantikan
DHSA dan mahkamah tidak boleh mendesak pengemukaannya hanya kerana
Peguam Negara (‘AG’) enggan mengemukakannya; (iv) hebahan berita AG,
dengan khusus, menyatakan bukan sahaja undang-undang yang bawahnya
pelantikan dibuat tetapi juga alasan-alasannya. Oleh kerana ini dibuat oleh
PP sendiri, iaitu AG, alasan-alasan tersebut tidak perlu dikemukakan di
mahkamah. Permohonan gagal menunjukkan asas pelantikan, seperti yang
dinyatakan dalam hebahan berita AG, cacat; dan (v) surat pelantikan
diklasifikasikan sebagai rahsia rasmi melalui pengeluaran perakuan bawah
s. 16A Akta Rahsia Rasmi 1972. Maka timbul rayuan ini. Pihak pendakwaan
mengabaikan bantahan mereka terhadap pengeluaran surat pelantikan
berdasarkan alasan terakhir yang dinyatakan di atas dan bantahan mereka
terhadap pengeluaran tersebut kini berasaskan s. 126 Akta Keterangan 1950
(‘AK’).

Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan; mengetepikan perintah Mahkamah
Tinggi)
Oleh Rhodzariah Bujang HMR menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah:
(1) Seksyen 126 AK memperuntukkan tiga keadaan apabila keistimewaan
peguam cara - anak guam timbul, kecuali yang mana-mana proviso
terpakai, dan keadaan-keadaan ini adalah (i) komunikasi yang dibuat
oleh anak guam kepada peguam belanya; (ii) kandungan dokumendokumen yang peguam bela telah lihat; dan (iii) nasihat yang diberi oleh
peguam bela kepada anak guamnya. Kelayakan ini ialah ketiga-tiga keadaan
ini mesti berlaku semasa, atau untuk tujuan, pelantikan peguam bela.
(2) Seksyen 126 AK terpakai pada AG dan DHSA kerana, dalam melantik
DHSA untuk mengendalikan pendakwaan terhadap perayu, AG, dalam
kapasiti beliau sebagai PR, tidak berbeza kedudukannya berbanding
seorang pelitigasi, sama ada dalam kes jenayah atau sivil, yang melantik
peguam bela atau peguam cara untuk menasihati atau mewakilinya di
mahkamah dalam pertikaian undang-undang melibatkan dirinya. Walau
bagaimanapun, untuk berlindung bawah s. 126 AK, pihak pendakwaan

mesti menunjukkan bahawa surat pelantikan adalah komunikasi
istimewa dan ini gagal dilakukan oleh AG. Berdasarkan ilustrasiilustrasi s. 126 AK, jelas bahawa yang dilindungi ialah maklumat yang
diberi oleh anak guam kepada peguam bela atau peguam caranya.
(3) Oleh kerana seorang pengamal undang-undang dilantik untuk
mengendalikan pendakwaan terhadap perayu, bukan Timbalan
Pendakwa Raya yang berkhidmat di Jabatan Peguam Negara, iaitu
seorang penjawat awam, perayu mempunyai kepentingan atau jangkaan
sah untuk melihat surat pelantikan yang melantik pengamal undangundang tersebut untuk mengendalikan pendakwaan kerana sistem
keadilan jenayah di Malaysia bersifat adversarial dan kewajipan paling
utama pendakwa ialah untuk bertindak adil. Oleh itu, AG berkewajipan
mengemukakan surat pelantikan apabila permohonan sedemikian dibuat
dan bukan hanya apabila cabaran khusus terhadap pelantikan tersebut
dibuat oleh perayu, atau tertuduh dalam keadaan sama, kerana beliau
mempunyai hak untuk tahu, dari permulaan prosiding, bahawa
pendakwanya ialah orang yang sah dilantik bawah s. 379 KTJ.
(4) Berdasarkan peruntukan jelas s. 55 AT, surat pelantikan terangkum
dalam seksyen tersebut kerana ini keterangan prima facie yang
diperlukan, dalam perkataan-perkataan seksyen tersebut ‘… untuk apaapa tujuan lain berkaitan mana-mana prosiding undang-undang …’. Skop
s. 55 AT lebih luas daripada, dan tidak terbatas pada, permulaan
prosiding jenayah. Dalam erti kata lain, tiada beza antara keperluan
mengemukakan kebenaran mendakwa sebelum pemulaan perbicaraan
dan pengemukaan surat pelantikan yang dibuat bawah s. 379 KTJ untuk
pengendalian prosiding jenayah di mahkamah. Pertimbangan ini cukup
dalam menjawab hujahan yang dibangkitkan oleh HMT bahawa surat
pelantikan bukan dokumen pra-perbicaraan yang perlu dikemukakan
bawah s. 51A KTJ.
(5) Pengumuman pelantikan DHSA, semasa hebahan berita AG, tidak
boleh melucutkan kepentingan sah perayu untuk melihat surat
pelantikan tersebut. Hebahan berita AG tidak memenuhi kewajipan
kerana dokumen ini ditujukan pada dunia umumnya dan tidak boleh
disamakan dengan surat pelantikan rasmi.

JUDGMENT
Rhodzariah Bujang JCA:
[1]
Datuk Hj Sulaiman Abdullah (“Datuk Hj Sulaiman”), an advocate and
solicitor of the High Court of Malaya was appointed by the Public Prosecutor
to lead the prosecution of the appellant in respect of seven charges preferred
against him under three different legislations, to wit, the Penal Code, the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 and the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities
Act 2001. A joint trial of all seven charges have been ordered by the High
Court and dates for the hearing had been fixed from 12 February 2019 to 29
March 2019. However, the trial has been stayed by this court on application
by the appellant pending the disposal of the appeals in respect of four
interlocutory decisions made by the learned High Court Judge, one of which
is His Lordship’s dismissal of the appellant’s notice of motion that the Public
Prosecutor produced to him a copy of Datuk Hj Sulaiman’s letter of
appointment or fiat. This judgment is in respect of the appeal against the
decision on the dismissal of the aforesaid notice of motion.

E

F

G

The Application
[2]
Prayer 1 of the notice of motion is worded wider than what we have
just mentioned above and which the learned High Court Judge had helpfully
translated in English in His Lordship’s judgment although His Lordship had
omitted to include the time frame stated in the said prayer, which is three
days from the date of the order. The said prayer (1) but with the time frame
is reproduced below, together with prayers (2) and (3):

H

[2019] 5 CLJ

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

A

(a) Prayer 1

B

The Applicant seeks an order from this Honourable Court to compel the
Respondent to produce Datuk Haji Sulaiman bin Abdullah’s letter of
appointment and copies of any other authorisation in writing executed by
the Respondent in relation to his appointment as a Deputy Public
Prosecutor within 3 days from the date of the order;

171

(b) Prayer 2
The Applicant be provided with copies of the letter of appointment and
documents produced by the Respondent pursuant to Prayer 1; and
C

(c) Prayer 3
The Applicant seek any further and/or other order, relief or direction
which this Honourable Court may deem fit and proper in the
circumstances.

D

E

F

G

H

[3]
However, at the hearing of the appeal before us, the argument was
centered on the production of only that letter of appointment and no other
related documents pertaining to the same were identified for our
consideration. Therefore, we would in this judgment concentrate on the
production of that letter of appointment only.
[4]
It is not disputed that Datuk Hj Sulaiman’s appointment was made
pursuant to s. 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that despite a number
of out of court requests to have sight of his letter of appointment made by
the appellant’s counsel, the requests were turned down which then led to the
filing of this formal application in court. The said section provides as
follows:
379. Employment of advocate
With the permission in writing of the Public Prosecutor an advocate may
be employed on behalf of the Government to conduct any criminal
prosecution or inquiry, or to appear on any criminal appeal or point of law
reserved on behalf of the Public Prosecutor. The advocate shall be paid
out of the public funds such remuneration as may be sanctioned by the
Minister of Finance and while conducting such prosecution or inquiry, or
appearing on such criminal appeal or point of law reserved, shall be
deemed to be a “public servant”.

[5]
Before proceeding with the points canvassed in the appeal, it would be
best if we first summarised the grounds for the rejection of the said
application by the learned High Court Judge.
The High Court Judgment

I

[6]
His Lordship first need to grapple with the issue of whether the
application was to challenge the validity of the appointment of Datuk Hj
Sulaiman or if it was just for production of the said letter of appointment and
His Lordship opined, based on the wordings in the notice of motion and from
the affidavits filed in support of the same, that it was only for production of



172

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

the said letter. We would have to agree with His Lordship on this score from
the clear and express words used in the notice of motion itself as reproduced
above and we would further fortify our stand by the statement made by Mr
Harvenderjit Singh, one of the appellant’s counsel, at the hearing before us
that the defence would be happy if the said letter be produced for their
inspection in our court. The said offer was of course not taken up by the
learned Attorney-General (“AG”).

A

B

[7]
Coming back to His Lordship’s reasonings, we would summarise them
as follows:
(i) The letter of appointment is not a pre-trial document covered by s. 51
of the Criminal Procedure Code which is only for documents mentioned
in the charge against the appellant.
(ii) There is no legal requirement to produce the letter of appointment under
the Criminal Procedure Code and reliance on s. 55 of the Interpretation
Acts 1948 and 1967 and s. 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code by the
appellant are misplaced because these provisions are on the institution
of legal proceedings and not on authorisation or permission to appoint
a qualified person to conduct prosecution in the Criminal Procedure
Code such as ss. 333 and 379 thereof. The earlier mentioned provisions
read:

C

D

E

55. Evidence of signature on fiat, etc.
Any written law providing that the fiat, consent or authority of any
person is necessary before any prosecution or other legal
proceedings are begun, or for any other purpose in connection
with any legal proceedings, shall be deemed also to provide that
any document purporting to be or to bear the signed fiat, consent
or authority of that person shall be received as prima facie evidence
in any proceedings without proof being given that the signature is
what it purports to be. (emphasis added)
129. Sanction required for prosecution for certain offences

F

G

(1) Except in the case of complaints laid by the Public Prosecutor
no Court shall take cognisance:
(a) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 of the
Penal Code except with the previous sanction of the Public
Prosecutor or on the complaint of the public servant concerned
or of some public servant to whom he is subordinate;
(b) of any offence punishable under section 193, 194, 195, 196, 199,
200, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 or 228 of the Penal Code
except with the previous sanction of the Public Prosecutor or
when the offence is committed in or in relation to any
proceeding in any Court on the complaint of such Court.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

173

(2) The provisions of subsection (1) with reference to the offences
named in it apply also to the abetment of those offences and
attempts to commit them.
(3) The sanction referred to in this section shall be in writing and
may be expressed in general terms and need not name the accused
person, but it shall so far as practicable specify the Court or other
place in which and the occasion on which the offence was
committed.

Drawing analogy from the authority of PP v. Lew Koy [2002] 1 CLJ 86; [2001]
4 MLJ 655 on a written authority to prosecute from the Public Prosecutor
under s. 377(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, His Lordship held that the
Public Prosecutor is only required to produce the letter of appointment if
there had been a challenge to the appointment of Datuk Hj Sulaiman. His
Lordship declined to follow the High Court decision in AK Koh Enterprise v.
PP Sdn Bhd [2000] 1 LNS 200; [2000] 6 MLJ 184 which held that such an
authorisation or sanction to prosecute must be tendered in court before trial
begins in order to confer jurisdiction on the court.
(iii) The appellant has failed to state specifically the reasons for the alleged
challenge to the appointment of Datuk Hj Sulaiman and the court cannot
compel its production solely on the ground that the Attorney-General
had refused to produce it.
(iv) The media release by the Public Prosecutor which was exhibited to the
affidavit in support of the application affirmed on 23 November 2018
had specified not just the law (s. 379 of Criminal Procedure Code) under
which the appointment was made but also the reasons for it, which was
the credentials of Datuk Hj Sulaiman as our nation’s leading barrister.
Given that it came from the Public Prosecutor himself, in the person of
the learned Attorney-General, there would not be a need to produce the
same in court. The application had also failed to show how the basis of
that appointment as stated in the media release was flawed.
(v) The letter of appointment has been classified as official secret by the
issuance of a certificate under s. 16A of the Official Secrets Act 1972.
The Appeal

H

I

[8]
We need to state at the outset that the learned Attorney-General at the
hearing of the appeal has informed us that the respondent is abandoning their
objection on the production of the letter of appointment based on the last
ground stated above and that their objection on the said production is
premised on s. 126 of the Evidence Act 1950. The said section reads:



174

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

Professional communications
126(1) No advocate shall at any time be permitted, unless with his client’s
express consent, to disclose any communication made to him in the
course and for the purpose of his employment as such advocate by or on
behalf of his client, or to state the contents or condition of any document
with which he has become acquainted in the course and for the purpose
of his professional employment, or to disclose any advice given by him
to his client in the course and for the purpose of such employment:

A

B

Provided that nothing in this section shall protect from disclosure:
(a) Any such communication made in furtherance of any illegal
purpose;

C

(b) Any fact observed by any advocate in the course of his employment
as such showing that any crime or fraud has been committed since
the commencement of his employment.
(2) It is immaterial whether the attention of the advocate was or was
not directed to the fact by or on behalf of his client.

D

Explanation - The obligation stated in this section continues after the
employment has ceased.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, a client, says to B, an advocate: “I have committed forgery and
I wish you to defend me.”

E

As the defence of a man known to be guilty is not a criminal purpose this
communication is protected from disclosure.
(b) A, a client says to B, an advocate: “I wish to obtain possession of
property by the use of a forged deed on which I request you to sue.”

F

This communication being made in furtherance of a criminal purpose is
not protected from disclosure.
(c) A, being charged with embezzlement, retains B, an advocate, to
defend him. In the course of the proceedings B observes that an
entry has been made in A’s account book, charging A with the sum
said to have been embezzled, which entry was not in the book at
the commencement of his employment.
This being a fact observed by B in the course of his employment, showing
that a fraud has been committed since the commencement of the
proceedings, it is not protected from disclosure.

In view of that stand adopted by the respondent, we would focus our
attention on that ground of objection now.
Legal Professional Privilege
[10] That is the essence of this s. 126 which is also known as solicitor-client
privilege. The section provides three instances when the privilege arises
(except where the provisos apply) and, that is:

(i) Communication made by the client to his advocate;
(ii) Contents of documents which the advocate has sighted; and
(iii) Advice given by the advocate to his client.

[11] The qualification, of course is that the three instances must have
occurred in the course of or for the purpose of the advocate’s appointment.
On the facts in this appeal, we would be confining ourselves to the first
instance only.
[12] We accept, firstly that the said section applies to the learned AttorneyGeneral and Datuk Hj Sulaiman because in appointing the latter to conduct
the prosecution against the appellant, the learned Attorney-General in his
capacity as the Public Prosecutor is in no different or worst position than a
litigant, be it in a criminal or civil case, who appoints an advocate or solicitor
to advise him or represents him in court in the legal dispute involving him.
However, in order to seek refuge under that section, the respondent must
show that the letter of appointment comes under privilege communication
which, with respect, the learned Attorney-General has failed to convince us
that it is so. This is because, if one were to look at the Illustrations to the
said section, which had been produced earlier, it is clear that what is
protected (or not as expressly stated in the section) is information given by
the client to his advocate or solicitor and this is exemplified in the judgment
of Augustine Paul J in PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim (No 3) [1999] 2 CLJ
215; [1999] 2 MLJ 1 where His Lordship said as follows in respect of the
said section:
This rule is established for the protection of the client, not of the
advocate, and is founded on the impossibility of conducting legal business
without professional assistance, and on the necessities, in order to render
that assistance effectual, of securing full and unreserved intercourse
between the two (see Jones v. Great Central Railway Company [1910] AC 4;
Lyell Kennedy (No 2) [1883] 9 App Cas 81; Wheeler v. Le Merchant [1881] 17
Ch D 675). As Jessel MR said in Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia [1876]
2 Ch D 644 at p. 649L
… It is absolutely necessary that a man, in order to prosecute his
rights or to defend himself from an improper claim, should have
recourse to the assistance of professional lawyers, and it being so
absolutely necessary, it is equally necessary, to use a vulgar phrase,
that he should be able to make a clean breast of it to the gentleman
and whom he consults with a view to the prosecution of his claim,
or substantiating his defence against the claim of others; that he
should be able to place unrestricted and unbounded confidence in
the professional agent, and that the communications he so makes
to him should be kept secret, unless with his consent (for it is his
privilege, and not the privilege of the confidential agent), that he
should be enabled properly to conduct his litigation. That is the
meaning of the rule.
…

It is not every communication made by a client to an advocate that is privileged from
disclosure. However, whatever a man says to his legal adviser about his private
affairs with a view to obtaining professional advice is presumed to have been said
in confidence and the object is to protect all such confidential communications (see
Sarkar on Evidence (15th Ed), Vol II page 2034). The privilege also extends to acts
of the client observed by the advocate (see Robson v. Kemp 5 Esp 52). As the privilege
is that of the client, he may expressly waive it under section 126 or impliedly under
section 128 of the Evidence Act 1950 by calling the advocate as his witness.
(emphasis added)

[13] Applying what is stated above to the facts of this case, we do not think
that the scope of that section should be stretched to include the formal letter
of appointment for it is not in the nature of such information as we said
earlier given by the learned Attorney-General to Datuk Hj Sulaiman.
Clearly, its production is not the mischief which the said section seeks to
overcome. We would, in this regard, draw an analogy which was rightly
made by the appellant’s counsel, between a letter of appointment or fiat and
a warrant to act which the court can demand production of and that of a
sanction to prosecute under s. 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code which
must be produced at the commencement of the trial where such a sanction
is required.
[14] In Augustine Paul’s book, Evidence Practice and Procedure (4th edn) at
p. 1055 under the heading “Limit of Communication“ an old case of Rex v.
Chhoa Mui Sai [1937] 1 LNS 68; [1937] MLJ 236 was cited and which is
relevant to this appeal where it was held that evidence of payment of $80 by
the client to the solicitor is not ‘communication’ within the meaning of s. 126
of the Evidence Ordinance. So there is in fact limits to what constitute
‘communication’ in the said section as highlighted above and this further
fortifies our view on its scope.
[15] Further, it is our view that since a private legal practitioner has been
appointed to conduct the prosecution against the appellant, not a Deputy
Public Prosecutor in the employment of the Attorney-General’s Chambers
who is a public servant, the appellant has a legitimate interest or expectation
to have sight of the letter appointing him to conduct the prosecution for it
must be remembered that our criminal justice system is an adversarial one
and the duty of a prosecutor to act fairly is paramount. As stated by the
Supreme Court of India in Food Corporation of India v. Kamdhenu Cattle Feed
Industries AIR 1993 SC 1601:
A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good.
This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is
‘fairplay in action’. Due observance of this obligation as a part of good
administration raises a reasonable or legitimate expectation in every
citizen to be treated fairly in his interaction with the State and its
instrumentalities, with this element forming a necessary component of the
decision-making process in all State actions. To satisfy this requirement of non-

arbitrariness in a State action, it is necessary to consider and give due weight to the
reasonable or legitimate expectations of the persons likely to be affected by the decision
or else that unfairness in the exercise of the power may amount to an abuse or excess
of power apart from affecting the bona fides of the decision in a given case. (emphasis
added)

B

[16] Therefore, in our view it is the bounden duty of the learned AttorneyGeneral to produce the letter of appointment when such a request has been
made and not only when a specific challenge to that appointment has been
mounted by the appellant, or an accused who is similarly circumstanced, for
he has the right to know from the start of the proceedings that his prosecutor
is one who has been validly appointed under the said s. 379.

[17] Further, by the clear provision of s. 55 of the Evidence Act 1950
which we had reproduced earlier, the letter of appointment comes within the
said section as it is prima facie evidence which is required, in the words of
the section, “… for any other purpose in connection with any legal
proceedings …”. The scope of s. 55 is wider and is not merely confined to
the institution of a criminal proceeding as submitted by the learned AttorneyGeneral, which submission was made in order to justify the production of
a sanction before the trial commences under the said s. 129 of the Criminal
Procedure Code. In other words, there is no difference between the need to
produce a sanction to prosecute before the commencement of a trial and the
production of a letter of appointment made under s. 379 of the Criminal
Procedure Code for the conduct of a criminal proceeding in court. This
consideration in our view is a sufficient answer to the point raised by the
learned High Court Judge that letter of appointment is not a pre-trial
document required to be produced under s. 51A of the Criminal Procedure
Code.
[18] As for the justification raised by the learned High Court Judge not to
order the said production on account of the media release, granted that it was
exhibited to the appellant’s own affidavit in support, but what it serves to
prove is there was an announcement by the learned Attorney-General on
Datuk Hj Sulaiman’s appointment but such an announcement cannot take
away that legitimate interest of the appellant to have sight of the letter of
appointment. That media release is also in our view, not a satisfaction of the
Attorney-General’s duty as stated above for such a document addressed to
the world at large cannot be equated with a formal letter of appointment.

[19] Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted before us that the
production of the letter of appointment should be allowed as there was case
precedent in which the same was produced. That was the case involving
Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim with regards to the sodomy charge preferred
against him where Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee bin Md Abdullah (“Tan Sri
Shafee”) who is now the appellant’s lead counsel was similarly appointed by



178

[2019] 5 CLJ

the then Attorney-General as a Deputy Public Prosecutor to conduct the
appeal in the Court of Appeal and subsequently in the further appeal to the
Federal Court (see PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim [2014] 4 CLJ 162 and Dato’
Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP and Another Appeal [2015] 2 CLJ 145, respectively).
We noted that there were two attempts made to disqualify Tan Sri Shafee’s
appointment by way of a notice of motion filed in this court pending the
hearing of the appeal against the acquittal of Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim
of the sodomy charge. The judgment of this court in respect of the first
application is reported in PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim [2014] 1 CLJ 354;
[2014] 1 MLJ 633 and the second one is reported in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim
v. PP [2014] 3 CLJ 441; [2014] 3 MLJ 882. We also noted that in the second
application but not the first, the learned Attorney-General was acting for
Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim. In other words, their present roles now are in the
reverse. Tan Sri Shafee submitted to us that his letter of appointment was
produced and exhibited before this court. We have no doubt that it was so
but without concrete evidence to say otherwise, we cannot rule out the
probability that the production of the said letter of appointment was on
account of the applications to disqualify him, and not out of a request made
before the commencement of a trial as in this case. Therefore, in actual fact,
there is no precedent for us to follow.
[20] However, for the reasons given earlier, the appeal is allowed and the
order of the learned High Court Judge set aside. In its place, we make an
order in terms of prayer (1) of the notice of motion but only in respect of
the letter of appointment, not the other documents sought for in it and in
prayer (2).
