punishable under section 39B(2) of the same act.”
Case for the Prosecution
[3]

The prosecution called 6 witnesses to prove the charges. The
prosecution evidence was largely unchallenged. On the morning of
18 February 2014, the accused arrived at Kuala Lumpur
International Airport from China. He was stopped at the
Immigration Counter as he did not possess a valid visa to enter
Malaysia, and was taken to the Temporary Holding Cell at the
airport to be sent back.

[4]

At about 2 that afternoon, PW1, a customs officer heard a cry
coming from the inside the holding cell. He proceeded there to
investigate and saw the accused seated on the floor near the cell
door, crying and pointing to a pile of purple objects on the floor.
According to PW1, it looked like a pile of grapes.

3



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

[5]

PW1 promptly informed his supervisor, Puan Hamidah, who
happened to be in the vicinity of the holding cell to have a look at
the objects. Suspecting that they were drugs, she immediately
proceeded to the Narcotics Office at the airport to inform the
officer in charge. In the meantime, PW1 left the accused alone for 5
five minutes to hand a file to the Operations Office. When he
returned, he noticed that the objects had been moved and placed
just outside the cell. The accused was standing at the cell door. The
other detainees in the same cell were all some distance away from
the accused, who was the only man of African origin in the cell.

[6]

Shortly after, Hamidah brought PW2 and other Police Personnel to
the holding cell. PW2 saw the two piles of objects outside the cell
door and the accused holding the cell door. PW2 examined the
objects and found in each pile, a total of 17 and 19 capsules,
respectively. PW2 seized and placed the capsules into two bags
[exhibits P22(A) and P22(C)]. PW2 further seized a black bag
containing the accused’s personal belongings and a laptop. The
accused’s passport was handed to PW2 by Hamidah.

[7]

PW2 took all the items seized and the accused to his office where
he prepared a search list and served a copy of it to the accused. He
then lodged a police report [exhibit P1]. PW2 weighed the capsules
and the gross weight was 500 grams. He then marked all the
capsules in exhibits P22(A) and P22(C) by recording the date and
placing his signature on them.

[8]

The same day, the accused and the exhibits seized were handed by
PW2 to the Investigating Officer, Inspector Amrin Bin Mohamad
(PW6), who kept the exhibits in his locker, to which no one had
access. The Investigating Officer further instructed that the accused
to be taken to the Serdang Hospital for an X-ray examination of his
abdomen. The accused was detained at a ward inside the emergency

4



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

zone and X-ray examination showed the presence of foreign objects
in his intestine. He was guarded by police personnel, PW3 and PW4
who were instructed to wait and watch over him till he excreted the
objects.
[9]

On 19 February 2014 at 8.40 in the morning, the accused excreted
27 capsules in the presence of PW3 and PW4. At 3.45 pm the
accused excreted another 2 capsules. All the capsules were marked
and photographed by PW3 and PW4. PW4 handed these capsules to
the Investigating Officer the same day. The Investigating Officer
made his own markings on all the capsules handed to him by PW2
and PW4 and sent them to the Chemistry Department for analysis.
The government Chemist, Norhaya binti Jaffar (PW5) confirmed
that the substance inside the capsules recovered from both the
holding cell and Hospital Serdang was methamphetamine. The
methamphetamine found in the capsules recovered from the holding
cell and Hospital Serdang were the subject of the two charges in the
instant case.

[10] The accused gave a cautioned statement to the police 5 days after
his arrest, and this was admitted into evidence. In his statement, he
put forth a detailed defence. Essentially, he said that he did not
know that the capsules he had swallowed contained drugs.
[11] So much was the evidence from the principal witnesses for the
prosecution. The other witnesses produced by the prosecution gave
general evidence in support of the prosecution.
Burden on prosecution
[12] The burden on the prosecution at the close of the prosecution case
to make out a prima facie case is encapsulated in s. 180 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. The nature of the burden on the
prosecution under section 180 was discussed and elucidated by the

Legal Network Series

Court of Appeal in Balachandran v. Public Prosecutor [2005] 1
CLJ 85; [2005] 2 MLJ 301 as follows:
Section 180(1) makes it clear that the standard of proof on the
prosecution at the close of its case is to make out a prima
facie case while s. 182A(1) enunciates that at the conclusion
of the trial the court shall consider all the evidence adduced
and decide whether the prosecution has proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt. The standard of proof on the
prosecution at the end of its case and at the end of the whole
case has thus been statutorily spelt out in clear terms. The
submission made must therefore be ratiocinated against the
background of the meaning of the phrase ‘prima facie case’ in
s. 180.Section 180(2) provides that the court shall record an
order of acquittal if a prima facie case has not been made out
while s. 180(3) provides that if a prima facie case has been
made out the accused shall be called upon to enter his
defence. A prima facie case is therefore one that is sufficient
for the accused to be called upon to answer. This in turn
means that the evidence adduced must be such that it can be
overthrown only by evidence in rebuttal. The phrase ‘prima
facie case’ is defined in similar terms in Mozley and
Whiteley’s Law Dictionary, (11 th Ed) as:
A litigating party is said to have a prima facie case
when the evidence in his favour is sufficiently strong
for his opponent to be called on to answer it. A prima
facie case, then, is one which is established by
sufficient evidence, and can be overthrown only by
rebutting evidence adduced by other side.
The result is that the force of the evidence adduced must be
such that, if unrebutted, it is sufficient to induce the court to

6



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

believe in the existence of the facts stated in the charge or to
consider its existence so probable that a prudent man ought to
act upon the supposition that those facts exist or did happen.
On the other hand if a prima facie case has not been made out
it means that there is no material evidence which can be
believed in the sense as described earlier. In order to make a
finding either way the court must, at the close of the case for
the prosecution, undertake a positive evaluation of the
credibility and reliability of all the evidence adduced so as to
determine whether the elements of the offence have been
established. As the trial is without a jury it is only with such a
positive evaluation can the court make a determination for the
purpose of s. 180(2) and (3). Of course in a jury trial where
the evaluation is hypothetical the question to be asked would
be whether on the evidence as it stands the accused could
(and not must) lawfully be convicted. That is so because a
determination on facts is a matter for ultimate decision by the
jury at the end of the trial. Since the court, in ruling that a
prima facie case has been made out, must be satisfied that the
evidence adduced can be overthrown only by evidence in
rebuttal it follows that if it is not rebutted it must prevail.
Thus if the accused elects to remain silent he must be
convicted. The test at the close of the case for the prosecution
would therefore be: Is the evidence sufficient to convict the
accused if he elects to remain silent? If the answer is in the
affirmative then a prima facie case has been made out. This
must, as of necessity, require a consideration of the existence
of any reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution. If
there is any such doubt there can be no prima facie case.
The statutory provisions and case law

7



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

[13] For convenience, I will set out the material sections of the Act on
which the prosecution relied on to prove the charges, or which are
otherwise material to this case
[14] The charges against the accused were framed under section
39B(1)(a) of the Act which provides:
(1)

No person shall, on his own behalf or on behalf of any
other person, whether or not such other person is in
Malaysia(a)

traffic in a dangerous drug;

(b)

...

(c)

...

[15] Section 2 of the Act defines trafficking as follows:In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires - trafficking
includes the doing any of the following acts, that is to say,
manufacturing, importing, exporting, keeping, concealing,
buying, selling, giving, receiving, storing, administering,
transporting, carrying, sending, delivering, procuring,
supplying or distributing any dangerous drug otherwise than
under the authority of this Act or the regulations made under
the Act.
[16] In Public Prosecutor v. Chia Leong Foo [2000] 6 MLJ 705, the
Court held that before the acts mentioned in the definition of
trafficking under section 2 of the Act can be invoked by the
prosecution, it must first prove the accused had possession of the
drugs. It is easy to discern the rationale for this requirement. An
accused would not be in a position to traffic in drugs unless he was

8



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

in possession or in custody or control of the same. In this regard,
Augustine Paul J explained:
It must be observed that most of the acts that constitute
trafficking as defined in section 2 of the Act like, for
example, keeping, concealing, storing, transporting, and
carrying dangerous drugs involve the prerequisite element of
possession ... It follows that a person cannot keep, conceal,
store, transport, or carry dangerous drugs within the meaning
of trafficking in the Act without being in the possession of
them.
[17] The meaning of possession for the purposes of the Act has been
considered in numerous cases. It has been held that there are two
elements to possession. There is the physical element, and the
mental element. The physical element involves proof that the thing
was in the custody of the accused or subject to his control. The
mental element involves proof that the accused had knowledge that
he was in possession of drugs. See Chan Pean Leon v. Public
Prosecutor [1956] 1 MLJ 237 and PP v. Muhammad Nasir b
Shaharudin [1994] 2 MLJ 576. In the latter case, the court
explained:
Possession is not defined in the DDA. However, it is now
firmly established that to constitute possession, it is necessary
to establish that: (a) the person had knowledge of the drugs;
and (b) that the person had some form of control or custody
of the drugs. To prove either of these two requirements, the
prosecution may either adduce direct evidence or it may rely
on the relevant presumptions under s. 37 of the DDA.
Ingredients of the offence

9



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

[18] It is clear from the foregoing that to prove the charges against the
accused, it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove:
i.

that the substance found in the capsules was dangerous
drugs within the definition of section 2 of the Act: and

ii.

that the accused person had mens rea possession of the
drugs ie, he had custody and control of the drugs and
knowledge that it was dangerous drugs; and

iii.

that the drugs were in the possession of the accused for
the purpose of trafficking

[19] I turn now to examine the evidence led by the prosecution to prove
the ingredients of the offence.
Whether the substance was dangerous drugs within the definition of
section 2 of the Act?
[20] The prosecution relied on the evidence of the government Chemist
to prove the identity and weight of the drugs found in the capsules.
The unchallenged evidence of the government Chemist in this case
established that the substance in the capsules recovered from the
holding room contained 266 grams of methamphetamine and the
substance in the capsules recovered from Serdang Hospital
contained 214.7 grams of methamphetamine, a dangerous drug
listed in the First Schedule of the Act.
[21] In Munusamy v. PP [1987] 1 MLJ 492, the Supreme Court made
this observation about the nature of evidence given by a chemist in
drug cases:
As a rule, a chemist in drug cases does not give any opinion
as to ownership, control or possession of the substance sent
for analysis, but he merely reports the result of the chemical

10



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

examination of the substance. The only reason for sending the
exhibits to the chemist is to determine their identity and to
confirm what other witnesses have suspected. This type of
opinion must in our view be distinguished from opinions
which are of very technical or complicated nature, such as
those given by handwriting, trade mark, copy right or ballistic
experts. Without being derogatory it is common knowledge
that even animals, such as snuff dogs when sufficiently
trained, are able to detect certain dangerous drugs. We are
therefore of the view, that is this type of cases where the
opinion of the chemist is confined only to the elementary
nature and identity of substance, the court is entitled to accept
the opinion of the expert on its face value, unless it is
inherently incredible or the defence calls evidence in rebuttal
by another expert to contradict the opinion.
Whether the accused had possession of the dangerous drugs?
[22] To prove that the accused had mens rea possession of the drugs, the
prosecution relied on the evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4
that the capsules were excreted by the accused. It was true that
PW1 did not see the accused excrete the capsules recovered from
the holding cell, but the fact that the capsules were found beside
accused soon after he was heard screaming in pain, indicated that
he must have excreted them. Next, and crucially the capsules were
similar in size, colour and shape as the ones he excreted at Hospital
Serdang. It cannot be gainsaid that the capsules were in his stomach
as he had swallowed them. It was unlikely the accused would have
swallowed the capsules without knowing its contents. Additional
evidence that showed the accused had knowledge that the capsules
contained drugs was borne out by the fact there was unchallenged
evidence that the accused had refused to eat whilst he was held at

11



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

the holding cell. His refusal indicated that he must have known that
if he consumed any food it would affect his bowel movement.
[23] On the evidence I was satisfied the accused had mens rea
possession of the drugs.
Issue of trafficking
[24] The quantity of drugs found in the possession of the accused was
well above the 50 grammes threshold that attracted the trafficking
presumption under section 37(da) of the Act which was in these
terms:
In all proceedings under this Act or any regulation made there
under:
(da) any person who is found in his possession of:
(iiia)

total of 15 grammes or more in weight of heroin,
morphine and monoacetylmorphines or a total of
15 grammers or more in weight of any two of the
said dangerous drugs;

(xvi)

50

more

in

weight

of

otherwise than in accordance with the authority of this Act or
any other written law, shall be presumed, until the contrary is
proved, to be trafficking in the said drug;
[25] The accused was thus presumed to have these drugs in his
possession for the purposes of trafficking.
Finding at end of Prosecution Case

12



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

[26] Thus, at the close of the prosecution’s case, I was satisfied, upon a
maximum evaluation of the evidence adduced by the prosecution’s
witnesses that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case
against the accused in respect of the charges which, if unrebutted,
would warrant his conviction. As such, the accused was called upon
to enter his defence.
Case for Defence
[27] The accused elected to give evidence on oath. He denied the
prosecution’s version of the facts. In particular, he denied that he
knew that the substance in the capsules was methamphetamine or
that he had swallowed it to conceal the drugs to avoid detection by
the authorities.
[28] I shall now refer to his evidence in detail. He said he was from the
Republic of Congo and travelled to Tanzania to look for work
because of financial problems. There, he stayed with a family
friend called Alain who introduced him to a lady called Shakira
who offered to give him a job, and told him he could earn US 5000
dollars. She told him he would be sent to Shenzen, China to meet
someone known as Boss, who had an assignment for him to travel
to Indonesia. Shakira arranged for his passport, visas and flight
ticket to travel to Shenzen.
[29] According to the accused, when he arrived in Shenzen, he met Boss
and was asked to stay in Shenzen for a few days. Boss told him that
he was to travel to Malaysia instead of Indonesia and assured him
that no visa was required for him to enter Malaysia as he was from
Congo. He was taken to meet Boss one day before his flight to
Malaysia, and the latter informed him that he was to bring
something into Malaysia. Boss showed him a bag that contained
capsules and asked him to swallow the capsules. He did not inquire
what was in the capsules. The accused said he consented and
13



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

swallowed the capsules because his family in Congo needed the
monies. He was unsure how many capsules he had swallowed.
[30] On 16 January 2014, he departed from Shenzen and arrived in
Malaysia the next day. He was, however, denied entry into
Malaysia at the Immigration check point as he did not have a visa,
and was taken to the Immigration Holding Cell. He admitted that he
had excreted the capsules in the instant case but maintained he had
no knowledge that the capsules he had swallowed contained
dangerous drugs.
Burden on the Defence
[31] The burden on the accused was to rebut the statutory presumption
under section 37(d)(a) of the Act that he had the drugs in his
possession for the purpose of trafficking on a balance of
probabilities.
[32] An accused person in possession of a dangerous drug shall
beacquitted if he proves that he neither believed nor suspected nor
had reason to suspect that the substance in question was a
dangerous drug. He does not have to know the type of drug but he
must prove that he neither believed nor suspected nor had reason to
suspect that the substance was a dangerous drug.
Analysis of Defence evidence
[33] In my judgment, the defence of the accused was in all respects,
unmeritorious. I disbelieved his evidence that he did know what
was in the capsules when he swallowed the same. This was a
common defence relied on by drug couriers and pose real
difficulties for the police and prosecuting authorities.
[34] Equally, I disbelieved his evidence that he swallowed the capsules
without asking Boss what was in the capsules. His story was simply
14



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

incredible. Boss was someone he had just met and had no reason to
blindly trust him to the extent he was willing to swallow capsules
without even knowing what was in the capsules.
[35] It was telling that the accused made no mention in his evidence as
to what he thought was in the capsules and why he did not ask Boss
about the contents, and the need to swallow them. His lack of
interest and compulsion to ascertain the contents of the capsules
demonstrated that he knew it contained drugs and accepted the
assignment fully aware of the consequences if he was apprehended.
I found his story that he did not know there were drugs in the
capsules implausible and a complete fabrication.
[36] In any event, the accused must have suspected that something was
amiss when Boss told him to swallow the capsules. It must have
surely crossed his mind that there could be drugs in the capsules
and that he was being asked to be a drug courier. He chose,
however, not to inquire about the contents though he was not
threatened or coerced by Boss to swallow the capsules. He wilfully
shut his eyes and made no inquiries, though he had opportunity to
do so, as to what was in the capsules and why Boss wanted him to
swallow the same. It is trite that there is a principle of law that
when a man deliberately shuts his eyes to the obvious, because he
does not want to know, he is taken to know.
[37] This is illustrated by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Emeka
John Paul v. Public Prosecutor [2016] 3 MLJ 757. There,
dangerous drugs were recovered, as in the instant case, from the
stomach of the appellant. The appellant claimed that he had no
knowledge of the drugs in the capsules discharged from his
stomach and he had swallowed the capsules as instructed by one
Oneka thinking they contained ‘silver. In dismissing his appeal

15



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

against his conviction and sentence, Prasad Abraham JCA
explained:
[20] In this regard, we refer to the decision of this court and
to the judgment of His Lordship Zamani A Rahim J in the
case of Abuchi Johnson v. Public Prosecutor [2015] 1 LNS
1225 and we quote:
The Appeal
[14] The sole issue advanced by the appellant was that
he had no knowledge of the drugs in the capsules
discharged from his abdomen. He was forced by Obi to
‘eat’ (swallow) the capsules before he boarded the
flight at Lagos airport. He was told by Obi that the
capsules which resembled the African food was
necessary for him to ‘eat’ (swallow) to overcome the
problems of cold weather and long distance travelling.
[15] Learned counsel contended that the appellant’s
cooperative conduct at the time of his arrest the KLIA
showed that he did not know he had swallowed the
capsules containing the drugs.
[16] The appellant’s defence of no knowledge of the
drugs was supported by his cautioned statement, D28
which the defence claim to have been given at the
earliest reasonable opportunity.
Our Decision
[17] Having heard the appeal, we found no merit on
the ground raised by the appellant. We therefore
unanimously dismissed the appeal and confirmed the

16



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

conviction and the death sentence imposed by the High
Court. We now give our reasons.
[18] Learned counsel argued that it was not disputed
that the appellant had sixty six (66) capsules in his
abdomen. However the defence submitted that the
appellant did not know he had swallowed the drugs in
the capsules. Had he knew the capsules contained the
drugs; he would not have swallowed them.
[19] Having scrutinised the appellant’s story, the trial
judge found there were many gaps and questions which
remained unanswered. The trial judge found the
appellant’s story was fraught with unreasonableness and
illogicality, namely:
(1) Why would Obi who paid the accused to have his
laptop repaired by the Accused was so ‘indebted’ to the
accused that he was willing to pay for the air ticket,
gave USD 3,000 for expenses and obtained visa for the
accused to come to Malaysia;
(2) The accused said that his life and security were not
threatened as Obi only held his jaw to open his mouth
for him to swallow the capsules. So the accused had all
the opportunity to escape or run away but he did not do
so; and
(3) The accused said he did not know what he
swallowed. Yes this defence is not an afterthought as it
was mentioned in his statement to police (D28), but he
had all the opportunity to find out as he was not
threatened. If he did not do so, its ‘wilful blindness’ on
his part and he himself to blame. In the Singapore Court

17



[2017] 1 LNS 1089

Legal Network Series

of Appeal case of Ubaka v. Public Prosecutor [1995] 1
SLR 267 at p 273, Kartigesu JA said:
In the light of these findings, the learned judge had to
decide whether the appellant had successfully rebutted
the presumptions of knowledge of the presence of the
drugs and their nature. He applied the principles laid
down in Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner
as modified by Tan Ah Tee & Anor v. Public Prosecutor
and which were reiterated in the recent decision of this
court in the case of Lim Swee Thong v. Public
Prosecutor. The learned judge concluded that:
Ignorance is a defence when there is no reason for
suspicion and no right opportunity of examination, and
ignorance simpliciter is not enough. Even if I had
accepted what the accused said (which I did not), he
was no an innocent custodian. He should have been
wary about Mike Udo by the time he was asked to carry
the bags and he should check (sic) the bags before
taking them with him.
The learned judge accordingly found the appellant had
not rebutted the statutory presumption on a balance of
probabilities, and convicted him.
On appeal, the same arguments that were canvassed
before the learned judge were canvassed before us. Just
as the learned judge found no merit in them, we too did
not find any merit in the appellant’s contentions and
accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the
sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge on
the appellant.

On examining the evidence of the accused, it is not
denied or disputed that he had the drugs in his abdomen
and discharged them in Malaysia. With many
questions/gaps unanswered, the story of the accused is
surely ‘highly improbable’ (Public Prosecutor v. Abdul
Rahman Aktif [2007]). Therefore, it cannot rebut the
presumption of knowledge and cast a reasonable doubt
in the prosecution case.
Further on the defence of wilful blindness, the accused
had all the opportunity to refuse as his life or security
was not threatened and he had only himself to blame.
He ‘should have been wary’ when asked to swallow the
capsule which he said resembled some African food.
This too cannot rebut the presumption of knowledge on
the balance of probabilities.
[20] With several questions and gaps remained
unexplained, the appellant’s version of the story had
failed to cast any reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s
case. In Public Prosecutor v. Abdul Rahman bin Akif
[2007] 4 CLJ 337; [2007] 5 MLJ 1, Arifin Zakaria FCJ
(as he then was) said at p 353:
[27] It is trite law that the court need not be convinced
of the defence story to entitle the accused to an
acquittal. The burden of proof on the accused is indeed
a light one which is merely to cast a reasonable doubt
on the prosecution’s case.
[21] His Lordship at p 354 of the judgment said that
the accused story was highly improbable and affirmed
the conviction imposed by the High Court.

[21] The version of the appellant in that he did not
appreciate what he was swallowing were drugs makes it now
difficult one for us to ‘swallow’. Would a person swallow
these pills and take a long journey to Malaysia? Even so,
what was more bewildering, what was the need for him to
swallow ‘silver’? Indeed, the intention to conceal was
present. The act and now the consequence in which the
appellant has found himself is certainly was a bitter pill to
swallow on hindsight.
[38] For these reasons I found the accused had failed to rebut on a
balance of probabilities the statutory presumption of trafficking
under section 37(da) of the Act. I also found that the accused had
not raised any reasonable doubt in my mind as to his guilt. I was
satisfied that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt
the case of trafficking against the accused as charged.
Conclusion
[39] For the foregoing reasons, the accused was found guilty and
convicted of the charge against him. He was accordingly, sentenced
to death in accordance with section 277 of the Criminal Procedure
Code.
