[CRIMINAL APPEALS NO: AA-42LB-(20-24)-11-2017
& AA-42LB-(25-28)-11-2017]
31 JANUARY 2019
CRIMINAL LAW: Money laundering – Elements of offence – Company and
directors charged for offence of receiving deposits from public without valid licence
granted under s. 6(4) of Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 (‘BAFIA’)
– Whether company’s business model fell within definition of ‘deposit’ under
BAFIA – Whether company received ‘deposit’ while carrying out ‘banking business’
– Whether company’s business required any form of licence issued under BAFIA –
Whether company committed any offence of money-laundering – Whether elements
of charge proved
The second to fifth respondents were the directors of the first respondent, a
public limited company. Initially, the first respondent operated its business
as follows (i) its main business was the sale and purchase of gold; (ii) the sale
of gold was carried out through direct selling or its sales agents;
(iii) purchasers would fill up purchasing forms and payments could be made
via cash, cheques, bank drafts or credit cards; (iv) purchasers would receive
their purchased gold either in the form of gold bullion, bar, ingot or gold
wafers; (v) purchasers were entitled to (a) one-time only 15% discount of the
purchase price payable within one month from the date of gold purchase;
(b) 18% discount of the purchase price payable in six payments at 3%
monthly; or (c) 2% extra to be paid either for the option in para. (a) or
(b) in the event the purchaser decides to keep their gold with the company;
(vi) the discounts/rebates were payable in cash or via cheques or deposit into
the purchaser’s bank account; and (vii) the first respondent also provided an
option to the purchasers that the first respondent would re-purchase the gold
from the purchasers at a price determined by the first respondent or at market
value. However, the first respondent’s mode of business was altered to the
following: (i) purchasers would fill up ‘post sale service form’ and
‘redeemable preference shares (‘RPS’) application form’ to replace their gold
invest into RPS; (ii) purchase price of shares starts at RM10,000 for 10,000
units of shares; (iii) purchasers would receive a share certificate depicting the
total units of shares which they own and a 36% discount of the purchasable
price payable in 12 payments at 3% monthly; and (iv) purchasers could
return the certificate to the first respondent and would be paid their purchase
price in full. The respondents were charged at the Sessions Court under
ss. 25(1) and 103(1) read together with Serial No. 20, Fourth Schedule of the
Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 (‘BAFIA’) for the offence of
receiving deposits from the public without a valid licence granted under
s. 6(4) of the BAFIA. The second to fifth respondents also faced multiple

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

charges under s. 4(1)(a), read together with s. 87(1)(a), of the AMLATFA.
At the conclusion of the prosecution’s case, the Sessions Court Judge (‘SCJ’)
found that the first respondent’s business model did not fall within the
definition of ‘deposit’ under the BAFIA and, as such, the first respondent had
not committed any offence under s. 25(1) of the BAFIA since the business
did not require any form of licence issued under the BAFIA. The SCJ held
that the appellant (‘the prosecution’) failed to prove a prima facie case against
all the respondents and the respondents were ordered to be acquitted and
discharged. Hence, the present appeal.

A

B

Held (dismissing appeal):
(1) The statutory definitions of the phrases ‘deposit’ and ‘banking business’,
when read together with ss. 4, 5, 6(4), 25(1) and 25(2) of the BAFIA,
would simply mean that for the prosecution to succeed in a charge
against the first respondent, for an offence under s. 25(1) of the BAFIA,
the prosecution must prove that the first respondent had not merely
received ‘deposit’ but when the first respondent received the ‘deposit’,
it did so whilst carrying out a banking business. The fact that the first
respondent received deposits whilst carrying out a banking business
without a valid licence issued to the first respondent, under s. 6(4) of the
BAFIA, was not an offence. Not merely the act of deposit-taking.
(para 31)
(2) The prosecution was sort of ‘trapped’ by the stringent requirement of
ss. 4, 5 and 6(4) and the definition of ‘banking business’ in s. 2 of the
BAFIA which, in essence, requires a licence under s. 6(4) for anyone
carrying out a ‘banking business’. The definition of ‘banking business’
is very stringent. All the requirements in paras. (i), (ii) and (iii) in the
definition of ‘banking business’, under s. 4 of the BAFIA, shall be
fulfilled before anyone could be convicted for an offence under s. 25(1)
of the BAFIA. All the three limbs must be read conjunctively and cannot
be read disjunctively. Therefore, if a person is providing only one of the
business under the three limbs in s. 2 of the BAFIA ie merely providing
financing but not collecting deposit, such activity would not be sufficient
to constitute ‘banking business’ under this definition. (paras 32, 33 & 35)
(3) It was unequivocally clear that although the first respondent was
‘receiving deposit’ and ‘taking deposit’, it was not receiving deposits on
current, deposit and savings accounts or other similar accounts. The first
respondent was also not involved in any activity of paying or collecting
cheques drawn by or paid in by customers, and the provision of finance.
As the first respondent never carried out all of these activities, the first
respondent’s business did not fall within the definition of ‘banking
business’. Consequently, the first respondent’s business did not require
any licence to be issued under s. 6(4) of the BAFIA. It followed that the
first respondent had not committed any offence under s. 25(1) of the

BAFIA. The second to fifth respondents, being the directors in the first
respondent, had also not committed any offence under s. 25(1) of the
BAFIA. (para 38)
(4) The money trail could be identifiable to the monies deposited into the
first respondent’s bank accounts, and transferred to other accounts either
belonging to the first respondent or companies that had business
relations and links with the first respondent, with the involvement of the
second to fifth respondents. However, the respondents were charged
under s. 4(1)(a) of the AMLATFA which does not use the phrase ‘any
person who engages in an unlawful activity or in any serious offence
commits a money laundering offence’. That is why s. 4(2) further
provides that a person may be convicted for an offence under sub-s. 4(1)
irrespective of whether there is a conviction in respect of a serious
offence or foreign serious offence or that a prosecution has been initiated
for the commission of a serious offence or foreign serious offence,
provided the ingredients under s. 4(1) is proven. All the evidence relied
upon by the prosecution during the trials before the SCJ for the charges
under the AMLATFA were entirely dependent upon the evidence for
the predicate offence against the respondents under s. 25(1) of the
BAFIA. Section 4(2) of the AMLATFA was inapplicable against the
second to fifth respondents. (paras 44 & 49-52)

JUDGMENT

A

[1]
The respondents were charged before the learned Sessions Court Judge
(“HMS”) for multiple offences (as particularised in the paragraphs below)
under ss. 25(1), 106(1) and 103(1)(a) of the Banking and Financial
Institutions Act 1989 (Act 372) (“BAFIA”), and ss. 4(1)(a) and 87(1)(a) of

Mohd Radzi Harun JC:

[2]
At the end of the prosecution’s case, the learned HMS decided that the
prosecution had failed to prove prima facie case against all the respondents for
all the charges and ordered that the respondents to be acquitted and
discharged.

decision.

and the learned counsel for the respondents, and having the benefit of
considering all the documents in the record of appeal, I dismissed the appeal
and affirmed the decision of the HMS to acquit and discharge all respondents
for all the charges.

The appellant premised its appeal on the following 11 grounds:

(i) Definition of “deposit”;

E

(ii) Prima facie case;
(iii) Offence under s. 25(1) is a strict liability offence;
(iv) The principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Arba’ei Othman &
Yang Lain lwn. PP & Rayuan Yang Lain [2014] 7 CLJ 32;

F

(v) HMS had taken into consideration irrelevant issues;
(vi) The letter from Bank Negara Malaysia dated 31 July 2006 that was
regarded by the respondents as a form of licence;
(vii) The Court of Appeal decision in PP v. Genneva Sdn Bhd (Rayuan
Jenayah W-09-375-10-2016);

G

(viii) The High Court case of PP v. The Gold Label Sdn Bhd & 6 Yang Lain
(Permohonan Jenayah Bil 44-210-2011);
(ix) Failure to call the investigation officer;

H

(x) Section 92 of the Evidence Act;
(xi) Other relevant cases
[18] The 113-page written judgment of the learned HMS touched on the
following five main issues that culminated in her finding to acquit and
discharge the respondents at the end of the prosecution’s case:

B

PP v. Bestino Group Bhd & Ors
And Another Appeal

(i) R1’s business model does not fall within the definition of “deposit”
under the BAFIA, and as such R1 had not committed any offence under
s. 25(1) as the business does not require any form of licence issued under
BAFIA;
(ii) Failure to call the material witness of the prosecution, the investigating
officer for the offence under BAFIA, that had resulted in many factual
and legal issues unanswered and led to a loophole and gap in the
prosecution’s case;
(iii) The non-application of ss. 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act;

C

D

(iv) The discount discontinuance notice (exh. P88) that had altered R1’s
mode of business commencing 3 November 2008 from gold investments
into RPS did not tantamount to deposit-taking;
(v) The High Court decision in Pets Global Pte Ltd & Anor v. Eng Hin Aquatics
Sdn Bhd & Anor [2016] 1 LNS 771 does not apply to this case. This is
particularly due to the finding of facts that had been distinguished
between the two cases. This is apparent in the business model of
Genneva Malaysia Sdn Bhd that involved concepts of “park-in” and
“buy-back guarantee” which do not appear on R1’s business model.

F

[19] In determining this appeal, I am guided by the applicable principle
that had been laid down by a plethora of authorities. Firstly, to warrant
appellate intervention, the appellant has to show to this court that the trial
judge was plainly wrong. Secondly, the appellate court will be slow in
interfering with the decision of the trial judge on findings of fact. This was
the reminder of the Federal Court in Herchun Singh & Ors v. PP [1969] 1 LNS
52; [1969] 1 MLRA 382 (FC) where it was held that:

G

An Appellate Court should be slow in disturbing such finding of fact
arrived at the Judge, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the
witness, unless there are substantial and compelling reasons for
disagreeing with the finding: see Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor AIR [1934]

[20] That principle had been adopted in numerous other decisions
including the Court of Appeal in Sivalingam Periasamy v. Periasamy & Anor
[1996] 4 CLJ 545; [1995] 3 MLJ 395 where it was held:

It is trite law that an appellate court will not readily interfere with the
findings of fact arrived at by the trial court to which the law entrusts the
primary task of evaluation of the evidence.

[21] Premised on those principles, and upon scrutinising the learned HMS’
grounds of judgment, and the record of appeal, I found that the learned HMS
had addressed all relevant issues and her findings and conclusions are correct.

[22] I would not deal with the second, third, fourth and fifth issues as
enumerated in para. [18] above as these issues had been sufficiently dealt
with by the HMS in parts K, L, M and N of her grounds of judgment. I agree
with her findings of fact and law on all those issues as stated in those
paragraphs of her judgment. Consequentially, I would not address the
appellant’s grounds as listed in para. [17](vii), (ix) and (x) above. As for the
other grounds raised by the appellant, I dealt with them in paragraphs below.
[23] I shall focus on the first and main issue which is whether R1’s business
model falls within the definition of “deposit” under the BAFIA. This issue
forms the main crux of the charge against R1. As R2, R3, R4 and R5 were
the directors in R1, it follows that the finding of this court on R1 would have
direct consequence on R2 to R5. It is also my finding that as the charges
against the respondents under BAFIA formed the predicate offence to the
charges against the R2 to R4 under the AMLATFA, if the answer to the main
question as stated above is in the negative, it would follow that there would
be no offence committed under s. 25(1) of BAFIA and there will also be no
offence committed under s. 4(1) of the AMLATFA.

D

[24] On this premise, I shall deal only with this sole issue and with respect
to the determination of that issue in the appeal against R1. My decision on
this issue would be applicable to the appeal against R2 to R5.
“Deposit” And “Banking Business”
[25]

E

Section 25(1) of the BAFIA provides:

No person shall receive, take, or accept deposits except under and in
accordance with a valid licence granted under section 6(4) to carry on
banking, finance company, merchant banking or discount house business.

F

[26] Although “deposit” is defined under s. 2 of the BAFIA, sub-s. 25(3)
of the BAFIA provides that for purposes of that s. 25 of the BAFIA, the
definition of “deposit” as found in s. 2 is modified and shall be read as
follows:
a sum of money or any precious metal, or any precious stone, or any
article which is comprised, in part or in whole, of any precious metal or
precious stone, and any other article or thing as may be prescribed by the
Minister, on the recommendation of the Bank, received, paid or delivered
on terms:
(a) under which it will be repaid or returned, with or without interest
or at a premium or discount; or
(b) under which it is repayable or returnable, either wholly or in part,
with any consideration in money or money’s worth, and such
repayment or return being either on demand or at a time or in
circumstances agreed by or on behalf of the person making the
payment or delivery and the person receiving it, regardless whether
the transaction is described as a loan, an advance, an investment,
a saving, a sale or a sale and repurchase,

but does not include money paid bona fide:
(A) by way of an advance or a part payment under a contract for the
sale, hire or other provision of property or services, and is repayable
only in the event that the property or services is not or are not in
fact sold, hired or otherwise provided;

(B) by way of security for the performance of a contract or by way of
security in respect of any loss which may result from the nonperformance of a contract;
(C) without prejudice to paragraph (B), by way of security for the
delivery up or return of any property, whether in a particular state
of repair or otherwise; and

C

(D) in such other circumstances, or to or by such other person, as
specified in the First Schedule.

D

[27] Subsection 6(4) provides that “Upon receiving an application and the
recommendation of the bank under this section, the Minister may grant the
licence, with or without conditions, or refuse the licence.”
[28] Subsection 6(4) must be read together with ss. 5 and 4 of the BAFIA
and the definition of “banking business” under s. 2 of the BAFIA.

E

[29] Section 5 is a provision relating to submission of an application for a
licence under s. 6(4) to carry out any of the business under s. 4.

Section 4 provides:

4. (1) No person shall carry on:
F

(a) banking, finance company, merchant banking, or discount house
business, unless it is a public company; or
(b) money-broking business, unless it is a corporation,
and holds a valid licence granted under section 6(4) to carry on such
business.

“banking business” means:

[2019] 5 CLJ

[31] It is my finding that the above statutory definitions of the phrases
“deposit” and “banking business”, when read together with ss. 4, 5, 6(4),
25(1) and 25(2) of BAFIA, would simply mean that for the appellant to
succeed in a charge against R1 for an offence under s. 25(1) of the BAFIA,
the appellant must prove that R1 had not merely received “deposit” but
when R1 had received the “deposit” R1 did so whilst carrying out a banking
business. The fact that R1 received deposit whilst carrying out banking
business without a valid licence issued to R1 under s. 6(4) of BAFIA is an
offence. Not merely the act of deposit-taking.
[32] It is my finding that the appellant was sort of “trapped” by the
stringent requirement of ss. 4, 5 and 6(4) and the definition of “banking
business” in s. 2 of BAFIA which in essence requires a licence under s. 6(4)
for anyone carrying out a “banking business”. “Banking business” is defined
as:

A

B

C

the business of:
(i) receiving deposits on current account, deposit account, savings
account or other similar account;

D

(ii) paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers; and
(iii) provision of finance. (emphasis added)

[33] The definition is very stringent. All the requirements in paras. (i), (ii)
and (iii) in the definition of “banking business” shall be fulfilled before
anyone can be convicted for an offence under s. 25(1) of the BAFIA.
[34] I referred to and concurred with the decision of Rohana Yusof J
(as Her Ladyship then was) in Light Style Sdn Bhd v. KHF Ijarah House
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd [2009] 3 CLJ 370, when Her Ladyship explained
succinctly the extent of the definition of “banking business” in s. 2 of the
BAFIA as follows:
[17] So the question next is whether the Defendant is carrying out
Banking Business without Licence and hence contravenes BAFIA.
Section 4 BAFIA provides that, no person shall carry on, inter alia, Banking
Business or Financing Business without holding a Valid Licence granted
under Section 6(4) BAFIA.

E

F

G

“Banking Business” is defined in Section 2 to mean:
(a) the business of:

H

(i) receiving deposits on current account, deposit account, savings
account or other similar account;
(ii) paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers;
and
(iii) provision of finance; or
(b) Such other business as the Bank, with the approval of the Minister,
may prescribe;

PP v. Bestino Group Bhd & Ors
And Another Appeal

A

From the above definition, a person is carrying out Banking Business only
if he is in the business of receiving deposits, paying and collecting cheques
drawn by customers and providing financing or such other business
prescribed by the Minister. Thus, Banking Business entails the acts of all
these three transactions and not just any one of them.

B

From the wordings of Section 2 ALL the three Limbs must be read conjunctively and
cannot be read disjunctively as suggested by Encik P.S. Gill. Therefore, if a person
is providing only one of the business under the three limbs in section 2, say merely
providing financing as in this case, but not collecting deposit, such activity would not
be sufficient to constitute Banking Business under this definition. It follows that,
even if it is true that the Defendant is providing financing in the
Murabaha Sales Agreement, the provision of financing per se by the
Defendant is not a Banking Business and requires no Licence under
section 6(4) BAFIA. Section 6(4) requires licencing only if a person is
carrying out, banking business, Finance companies business, merchant
banking business or discount house business ...

C

D

E

F

G

H

I

[18] It is to be noted that even the definition of “finance company
business” in section 2 entails receiving of deposits and provision of credit,
leasing, hire purchase or acquiring rights and interest in hire purchase. In
my view there is therefore no basis to say that the Defendant has
contravened any of the provisions in BAFIA in the transaction with the
Plaintiff ...”.
(emphasis added)

[35] The key phrase in the said decision is “... All the three limbs must be
read conjunctively and cannot be read disjunctively... Therefore, if a person
is providing only one of the business under the three limbs in s. 2, say merely
providing financing as in this case, but not collecting deposit, such activity
would not be sufficient to constitute banking business under this definition.”
[36] This court agrees with the submission of the appellant on the
application of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Arba’ei Othman
(supra) for purposes of determining that R1 had committed the act of
“deposit-taking”. But I must stress that the facts pertaining to the business
conducted by R1 although was an act of “deposit-taking”, it differs with that
facts pertaining to “deposit-taking” as found in Arba’ei Othman (supra). It was
an act of “deposit-taking” in the loose sense of the phrase and not as intended
by the relevant provisions of BAFIA, and as expounded in Arba’ei Othman
(supra). This court agrees with the submission of the learned counsel for the
respondents that the main crux of the decision in Arba’ei Othman is that
s. 25(1) of the BAFIA was enacted to regulate the banking and financial
industry by way of licensing so as to prevent the situation where depositors
were deprived of the repayment of the principal sum deposited by unlicensed
institutions. On the contrary, in case of R1 and the other respondents, the
goods in respect of which the money was paid (the gold products sold by R1)
were delivered to the purchasers. There was no issue of purchasers being
deprived of repayment as the consideration given by the purchasers has been
exchanged with the goods delivered by R1 under a sale and purchase of goods

arrangement. The net effect of this arrangement was that the necessity to
protect depositors of R1 as envisaged by Arba’ei Othman (supra) does not arise
in the instant case.
[37] Applying both the decisions in Arba’ei Othman (supra) and Light Style
Sdn Bhd (supra), it is my considered view that although the modus operandi of
R1’s activities and businesses could fall within the expanded definition of
“deposit” in s. 25(3), s. 25(3) is not a stand-alone provision. As explained
succinctly in Light Style Sdn Bhd (supra), that s. 25(1) and 25(3) must be read
together with ss. 4, 5, 6(4) and the definition of “banking business” in s. 2
of BAFIA.

A

B

C

[38] It is unequivocally clear that although R1 was “receiving deposit” and
“taking deposit”, R1 was not receiving deposits on current account, deposit
account, savings account or other similar account. Not only that, R1 was also
not involved in any activity of paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid
in by customers, and the provision of finance. As R1 never carried out all
of these activities, R1’s business does not fall within the definition of
“banking business”. And consequentially, R1’s business does not require any
licence to be issued under s. 6(4) of BAFIA. It follows that R1 has not
committed any offence under s. 25(1) of BAFIA. Consequentially, R2, R3,
R4 and R5 being the directors in R1 had also not committed any offence
under s. 25(1) of BAFIA.

D

[39] On the letter from Bank Negara Malaysia dated 31 July 2006, it is my
finding that the ruling by the HMS in accepting that letter as an evidence was
correct. To this court, that letter from Bank Negara does not tantamount to
a licence as envisaged by s. 6(4) of BAFIA. But that letter works to the
positive benefit of R1 as it goes on to show that R1 was truthful and honest
in its business transactions. It showed that R1 had taken the necessary actions
to ensure that their business is in conformity with the rules and regulations
of Bank Negara Malaysia even before they venture into any transactions with
the general public.

F

[40] On the issue of s. 25(1) of the BAFIA being a strict liability offence
as raised by the appellant, this court had referred to the decision of the Court
of Appeal in Arba’ei Othman (supra) where it was decided:
The provisions of ss. 25(1) and 106(1) were drafted to avoid adverse
impact on the public resulting from individuals or companies that accept
deposits without license that could lead to depositors not receiving their
capital returns. Therefore, the offence under s. 25(1) read together with
s. 106(1) was a ‘regulation for the public welfare of a particular activity.
By making the offence under s. 25(1) read with s. 106(1) an offence of
strict liability, it would help the enforcement of the said laws to be more
effective. In this case, the appellants had failed to prove that the offence
committed by PLSB was not agreed upon by them or that they had
exercised all efforts to prevent PLSB from committing such offences.

PP v. Bestino Group Bhd & Ors
And Another Appeal

353

[41] It is the finding of this court that the determination by the Court of
Appeal that s. 25(1) of the BAFIA is a strict liability offence is specifically
referring to that section when read together with s. 106(1) of that Act. It
would mean that if R1 is found guilty under s. 25(1), then R2 to R5 being
the directors of R1 would be held liable under the principle of strict liability,
unless the statutory requirements under s. 106(1) is successfully proven by
them. This is the actual effect of Arba’ei Othman (supra). This is also in line
with the high authority on the law relating to strict liability as decided by
Raja Azlan Shah J (as His Lordship then was) in PP v. Ooi Kee Saik & Ors
[1971] 1 LNS 113:
In my view what the prosecution have to prove and all that the
prosecution have to prove is that the words complained of, or words
equivalent in substance to those words, were spoken by accused No. 1 at
the dinner party. Once that is proved the accused will be conclusively
presumed to have intended the natural consequences of his verbal acts
and it is therefore sufficient if his words have a tendency to produce any
of the consequences stated in s. 3(1) of the Act. It is immaterial whether
or not the words complained of could have the effect of producing or did
in fact produce any of the consequences enumerated in the section. It is
also immaterial whether the impugned words were true or false.
(See Queen Empress v. Ambra Prasad [1898] ILR 20 All 55, 69). And it is not
open to the accused to say that he did not intend his words to bear the
meaning which they naturally bear. (See Maniben v. Emperor AIR 1933 Bom
65, 67).

[42] The lay intent of Parliament must be given its full effect by the courts.
As s. 3(1) of the Sedition Act was drafted with the clear intent of making the
offence a strict liability, it was given the effect as such in that decision. This
principle was also referred with approval in the decision of the Federal Court
in Kerajaan Malaysia v. Mat Shuhami Shafiei [2018] 3 CLJ 1.
Finding On The Charges Under AMLATFA

G

H

[43] I now move on to the charges under AMLATFA against R2, R3, R4
and R5.
[44] Upon perusing the documents in the record of appeal, I am satisfied
that the money trail could be identifiable to the monies deposited into R1’s
bank accounts, and transferred to other accounts either belonging to R1 or
companies that have business relations and links with R1, with the
involvement of R2 to R5.
[45] These are the finding of facts made by this court pursuant to s. 70(1)
of the AMLATFA on the balance of probabilities.

I

[46] But it must be emphasised that s. 70(2) of the AMLATFA provides
that s. 70(1) shall only apply on the finding of facts. Section 70(2) therefore
further places the burden of proof on the prosecution or appellant to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt.



354

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[47] I agree with the submission of the appellant that s. 4(2) of the
AMLATFA clearly provides that:
a person may be convicted of an offence under subsection 4(1) irrespective
of whether there is a conviction in respect of a serious offence or foreign
serious offence or that a prosecution has been initiated for the
commission of a serious offence or foreign serious offence.

A

B

[48] However, it is my finding that the respondents were charged under
s. 4(1)(a) which provides:
“any person who engages, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that
involves proceeds of an unlawful activity” commits a money laundering
offence.

C

[49] I found that s. 4(1)(a) does not use the phrase: “any person who
engages in an unlawful activity or in any serious offence commits a money
laundering offence.”
[50] That is why s. 4(2) further provides that a person may be convicted
of an offence under sub-s. 4(1) irrespective of whether there is a conviction
in respect of a serious offence or foreign serious offence or that a prosecution
has been initiated for the commission of a serious offence or foreign serious
offence, provided the ingredients under s. 4(1) is proven.

D

[51] I found that all the evidence relied upon by the appellant during the
trials before the HMS for the charges under AMLATFA were entirely
dependent upon the evidence for the predicate offence against R1 and R2 to
R5 under s. 25(1) of the BAFIA.

E

[52] Consequential to the earlier order of this court to acquit and discharge
R1 and R2 to R5 for the charges under s. 25(1) of the BAFIA, which is
conceded by the appellant as a predicate offence to the charges under s. 4(1)
of the AMLATFA against R2, R3, R4 and R5, it is therefore my finding that
s. 4(2) of the AMLATFA is inapplicable against R2, R3, R4 and R5.
[53] After hearing the learned deputies appearing for the appellant and the
learned counsel for the respondents and upon due consideration of their oral
submissions, written submissions and the records of appeal, I found myself
in agreement with the learned trial judge. I did not find any appealable error
in the decision of the HMS to warrant appellate intervention.
[54] Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal for both BAFIA and AMLATFA.
I affirmed the decision of the Sessions Court to acquit and discharge all the
respondents from all charges.
