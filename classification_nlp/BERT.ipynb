      "intention on the part of the appellants. They would not have kept the   money\n",

      "which was that PW7, PW10   and PW11 were not detained as suspects, instead it\n",

      "(ii)      the seriousness of the offence as reflected by the penalty provided;\n",
      "(iii)      the lofty status and the position of responsibility of the first\n",
      "appellant at   the material time and the need to exemplify high moral standard;\n",

      "being   served by the first appellant since the offence of sodomy is quite\n",
      "distinct   from the offence in his previous conviction;      (vii) that the\n",
      "service of the first appellant to the nation has been taken into   account\n",
      "although there was hardly any mitigating factors submitted on   his behalf; and\n",

      "Public interest demands such considerations. There   is no denial that the first\n",

      "vast knowledge and experience in criminal work.   All conceivable arguments were\n",
      "taken up. All grievances, both justified and   unjustified, against anyone that\n",
      "could be remembered, were allowed. We agree   with the approach adopted by the\n",
