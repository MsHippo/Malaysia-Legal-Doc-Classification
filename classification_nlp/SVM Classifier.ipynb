The sum had been obtained as\\r\\r\\na result of alleged smuggling activities carried out by the respondents. The\\r\\r\\nPP did not institute any prosecution against the respondents for any offence\\r\\r\\nand none of them had been convicted for any offence under the Customs Act\\r\\r\\n1967 (â\\x80\\x98the Actâ\\x80\\x99). The PP submitted that based on investigation by the\\r\\r\\ninvestigating officer (â\\x80\\x98IOâ\\x80\\x99), the first respondent sold cigarettes and liquor to\\r\\r\\nbuyers at a place outside Labuan, which was an offence under s. 135(1)(g)\\r\\r\\nof the Act. Sixteen deposits made into the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s account were\\r\\r\\nstated as â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99. The first respondent then transferred several\\r\\r\\nbig sums of money from its account into the accounts of the third, fourth and\\r\\r\\nfifth respondents which totalled up to RM1,044,480. According to the PP,\\r\\r\\nthe respondents could not explain why the accounts did not tally with the\\r\\r\\nbuyersâ\\x80\\x99 account and statements. The first respondent had allegedly exported\\r\\r\\nor sold duty free cigarettes from Labuan to unknown buyers in Malaysia.\\r\\r\\nThe proceeds from the sales were paid in Miri and Kota Kinabalu and the\\r\\r\\nPP submitted that the acts of the respondents in failing to pay tax for the sales\\r\\r\\nformed a case of smuggling and contravened s. 135(1)(g) of the Act. The\\r\\r\\nissues that arose for the courtâ\\x80\\x99s determination were: (i) whether the\\r\\r\\nrespondents sold the cigarettes in contravention of the Act or were engaged\\r\\r\\nin money laundering which entitled the PP to seize and to forfeit the sums\\r\\r\\nin the bank account; and (ii) whether the cigarettes were sold and delivered\\r\\r\\nto the purchasers in Labuan.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n679\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nHeld (dismissing application):\\r\\r\\n(1) The freezing or seizures of the accounts were set aside. The PP failed\\r\\r\\nto establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the respondents were\\r\\r\\ninvolved in money laundering or in unlawful activities or that the\\r\\r\\nproceeds in the bank accounts were or are the proceeds from unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivities or for the purpose of money laundering. (para 53)\\r\\r\\n(2) There was no explanation as to why the second respondent was included\\r\\r\\nin this application. The PP did not seize any bank account of the second\\r\\r\\nrespondent and had not applied to forfeit any money in any bank\\r\\r\\naccount of the second respondent. There was no evidence led that the\\r\\r\\nsecond respondent was involved in selling duty free cigarettes or\\r\\r\\ninvolved in smuggling them or that he was involved in money\\r\\r\\nlaundering. The application against the second respondent ought to be\\r\\r\\nstruck out. (para 35)\\r\\r\\n(3) Although the PP contended that based on documents exhibited, the\\r\\r\\ncigarettes were sold outside Labuan, no direct evidence was led that the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondent and/or the other respondents had transported or\\r\\r\\nexported duty free cigarettes from Labuan which were sold in Miri or\\r\\r\\nKota Kinabalu. There was also no evidence led that the cigarettes were\\r\\r\\nsold in Malaysia and that they were intended to evade customs or import\\r\\r\\nduty. (para 36)\\r\\r\\n(4) There was no evidence that the cigarettes in the 16 transactions\\r\\r\\ndescribed as â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99 which the IO said were paid for in\\r\\r\\nMiri, were sold or delivered to the purchasers outside Labuan or in Miri\\r\\r\\nor Kota Kinabalu. Furthermore, the PP did not refer to any provision\\r\\r\\nor regulations under the Act or any legislation that duty free cigarettes\\r\\r\\nsold in Labuan must be paid in Labuan or could not be paid for in Miri\\r\\r\\nor elsewhere. Similarly, the PP did not refer to any Bank Negara\\r\\r\\nregulations or directives that duty free cigarettes sold in Labuan must be\\r\\r\\npaid in Labuan or could not be paid in Miri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n(paras 39 & 41)\\r\\r\\n(5) There is no provision in the Act against any sale outside Labuan. Section\\r\\r\\n155(1)(b) of the Act provides that no export duty shall be payable upon\\r\\r\\nany goods exported from Labuan. If the goods were imported or\\r\\r\\ntransported to Malaysia from Labuan or Langkawi, then s. 155(1)(c)\\r\\r\\nprovides that import duty shall be payable upon all dutiable goods\\r\\r\\ntransported to the principal customs area from Labuan or Langkawi to\\r\\r\\nall intents as if such transportation to the principal customs area were\\r\\r\\nimportation into Malaysia (para 42).\\r\\r\\n(6) The IO did not affirm that he is or was an accountant or an expert in\\r\\r\\naccounts or auditing or accounting or forensic accounting. The IO did\\r\\r\\nnot connect with each â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99 or each transaction or sale of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes to each smuggling of cigarettes or unlawful sales of cigarettes\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n680\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nor which were in contravention of the Act. The PP did not exhibit any\\r\\r\\nreport by any accountant or expert to trace or connect the entries in the\\r\\r\\nledgers or accounts with any smuggling of cigarettes or unlawful sales of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes or that these proceeds or payments were derived from\\r\\r\\nunlawful activities or for money laundering (para 50).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n(7) The IO did not produce any report from the Inland Revenue or Tax\\r\\r\\nDepartment that the respondents had evaded income tax or other taxes\\r\\r\\nwhich contravened any law. There was no report by Bank Negara or any\\r\\r\\nother banks that these bank accounts or the proceeds in the bank\\r\\r\\naccounts were involved in money laundering. Hence, the PP could not\\r\\r\\nshow that the transactions or payments into the bank accounts of the\\r\\r\\nthird, fourth and fifth respondents were proceeds from unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivities (paras 50 & 51).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCase(s) referred to:\\r\\r\\nPP v.

The PP did not\\r\\r\\ninstitute any prosecution against any of the five respondents for any offence\\r\\r\\nand none of them has been convicted for any offence under Act 613 nor\\r\\r\\nunder the Customs Act 1967. However it was contended that these sums had\\r\\r\\nbeen obtained as a result of or in connection with smuggling activities carried\\r\\r\\nout by the respondents. The PP accordingly applied under s. 56(1) of Act 613\\r\\r\\nthat the monies in the 25 bank accounts be forfeited because such properties\\r\\r\\nhad been obtained as a result of or in connection with an offence of money\\r\\r\\nlaundering under s. 4(1) of the Act.\\r\\r\\n[4]\\r\\r\\nReading the application, affidavits and submissions, the PP submitted\\r\\r\\nthat based on an investigation conducted by the IO the first respondent sold\\r\\r\\ncigarettes and liquor to buyers where the transactions occurred at a place\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan and that the respondents had committed an offence under\\r\\r\\ns.135(1)(g) of the Customs Act by knowingly being concerned in fraudulent\\r\\r\\nevasion or attempt at fraudulent evasion of customs duty or in evasion or\\r\\r\\nattempt at evasion of any prohibition of import or export. The grounds of the\\r\\r\\napplication were set out in the affidavit in support of the IO affirmed on\\r\\r\\n18 September 2013 (â\\x80\\x98first affidavitâ\\x80\\x99) and in another affidavit also affirmed on\\r\\r\\nthe same date and time marked as exh. â\\x80\\x98AT10(4)â\\x80\\x99 (â\\x80\\x98second affidavitâ\\x80\\x99).\\r\\r\\n[5]\\r\\r\\nIt must be stated that the marking of the exhibits by the PP was\\r\\r\\nconfusing. The exhibits attached to the first affidavit of the IO were marked\\r\\r\\nas exhs. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT8 2â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT3(a) to (o)â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT4(a)-(b)â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT5â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT6â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT7â\\x80\\x99,\\r\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98AT8â\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98AT9â\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98AT10 (1) to (4)â\\x80\\x99. The second affidavit of the IO which\\r\\r\\nwas affirmed on the same date and time was annexed to the first affidavit and\\r\\r\\nmarked as exh. â\\x80\\x98AT10 (4)â\\x80\\x99. However the exhibits attached to the second\\r\\r\\naffidavit were similarly marked as exhs. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 until â\\x80\\x98AT8â\\x80\\x99. When the IO\\r\\r\\nreferred to exh. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99, he did not explain which â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 he was referring to.\\r\\r\\nAny exhibits to be marked must be in running numbers and not be repeated\\r\\r\\nto avoid confusion.\\r\\r\\n[6]\\r\\r\\nFurther, the PP exhibited about 1,000 pages of the ledgers, trial\\r\\r\\nbalances and balance sheets of the first respondent annexed to the affidavits\\r\\r\\nof the IO. However there was no pagination for easy reference. When the IO\\r\\r\\nreferred to a certain entry or entries in the ledger, he did not refer to the page\\r\\r\\nwhere the entries appeared in the ledger, the significance of the entries and\\r\\r\\nwhether these involved or were connected with money laundering.\\r\\r\\n[7]\\r\\r\\nAct 613 is an Act to provide for the offence of money laundering, the\\r\\r\\nmeasures to be taken for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism\\r\\r\\nfinancing offences and to provide for the forfeiture of terrorist property and\\r\\r\\nproperty involved in, or derived from, money laundering and terrorism\\r\\r\\nfinancing offences, and for matters incidental thereto and connected\\r\\r\\ntherewith. Section 2(1) states that this Act shall apply to any serious offence,\\r\\r\\nforeign serious offence or unlawful activity whether committed before or\\r\\r\\nafter the commencement date of this Act. â\\x80\\x9cSerious offenceâ\\x80\\x9d means any of the\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n682\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\noffences specified in the Second Schedule or an attempt to commit any of\\r\\r\\nthose offences or the abetment of any of those offences. Section 135 of the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act has been included in the Second Schedule as one of the serious\\r\\r\\noffences. Section 2(2) provides that this Act shall apply to any property,\\r\\r\\nwhether it is situated in or outside Malaysia.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[8]\\r\\r\\nSection 4(1) of Act 613 provides for an offence of money laundering\\r\\r\\nwhich states that any person who (a) engages in, or attempts to engage in; or\\r\\r\\n(b) abets the commission of, money laundering, commits an offence. In the\\r\\r\\ndefinition section, money laundering is defined as the act of a person who:\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n(a) engages, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that involves\\r\\r\\nproceeds of any unlawful activity;\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n(b) acquires, receives, possesses, disguises, transfers, converts,\\r\\r\\nexchanges, carries, disposes, uses, removes from or brings into\\r\\r\\nMalaysia proceeds of any unlawful activity; or\\r\\r\\n(c) conceals, disguises or impedes the establishment of the true nature,\\r\\r\\norigin, location, movement, disposition, title of, rights with respect\\r\\r\\nto, or ownership of, proceeds of any unlawful activity;\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\r\\n(aa) as may be inferred from objective factual circumstance, the\\r\\r\\nperson knows or has reason to believe, that the property is\\r\\r\\nproceeds from any 1 unlawful activity; or\\r\\r\\n(bb) in respect of the conduct of a natural person, the person without\\r\\r\\nreasonable excuse fails to take reasonable steps to ascertain\\r\\r\\nwhether or not the property is proceeds from any unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivity ...\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[9]\\r\\r\\nThere are two parts in this definition. Firstly, the act of a person who\\r\\r\\ninter alia engages in a transaction that involves proceeds of any unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivity or receives proceeds of any unlawful activity and secondly he knows\\r\\r\\nor has reason to believe that the property is proceeds from any unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivity or fails to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether or not the\\r\\r\\nproperty is proceeds from any unlawful activity. The burden is on the PP to\\r\\r\\nprove both these ingredients using the standard of proof required in civil\\r\\r\\nproceedings: see s. 56(4) of Act 613; Pendakwa Raya v. V Alexandra a/l Chako\\r\\r\\nVanglise (and another case) [2010] 8 AMR 159.\\r\\r\\n[10] Under s. 56(1), in respect of any property frozen or seized under this\\r\\r\\nAct where there is no prosecution or conviction for an offence under\\r\\r\\nsub-s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence, the Public Prosecutor may,\\r\\r\\nbefore the expiration of 12 months from the date of the freeze or seizure,\\r\\r\\napply to a judge of the High Court for an order of forfeiture of that property\\r\\r\\nif he is satisfied that such property had been obtained as a result of or in\\r\\r\\nconnection with an offence under sub-s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence,\\r\\r\\nas the case may be, or is terrorist property.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v.

(1) shall make an order for the forfeiture of the property if he\\r\\r\\nis satisfied:\\r\\r\\n(a) that the property is the subject matter of or was used in the commission\\r\\r\\nof an offence under sub-s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence or is\\r\\r\\nterrorist property;\\r\\r\\n(b) that there is no purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration in\\r\\r\\nrespect of the property.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nUnder s. 56(3) any property that has been seized and in respect of which no\\r\\r\\napplication is made under sub-s. (1) shall, at the expiration of 12 months\\r\\r\\nfrom the date of its seizure, be released to the person from whom it was\\r\\r\\nseized. The bank accounts were seized on 21 September 2012 and this\\r\\r\\napplication for forfeiture was made on 19 September 2013. There was no\\r\\r\\nobjection or complaint by the respondents that it was outside the 12 months\\r\\r\\nas provided in s. 56 of Act 613: see PP v. Dragcom Sdn Bhd & Ors and Other\\r\\r\\nCases [2013] 10 CLJ 628; [2013] 5 MLJ 594.\\r\\r\\n[12] Under s. 61(2) of Act 613 the judge to whom an application is made\\r\\r\\nunder s. 56(1) shall cause to be published a notice in the Gazette calling upon\\r\\r\\nany third party who claims to have any interest in the property to attend\\r\\r\\nbefore the court on the date specified in the notice to show cause as to why\\r\\r\\nthe property shall not be forfeited. After the Gazette was published, no third\\r\\r\\nparty had come forward to claim any of the monies in these accounts except\\r\\r\\nthe respondents who held these accounts. Therefore the provisions of s. 61(4)\\r\\r\\nare not applicable to this application for the forfeiture of the proceeds in these\\r\\r\\n25 accounts.\\r\\r\\n[13] In his first affidavit, the IO affirmed that the first respondent was\\r\\r\\nincorporated with an address in Labuan and with its business to import and\\r\\r\\nexport beers, liquors and cigarettes. The other respondents were the\\r\\r\\nshareholders and directors of the first respondent (see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[14] He affirmed that from his investigation the 1st respondent had bought\\r\\r\\ncigarettes from two companies ie, Lihan Trading and Syarikat Jayapuri in\\r\\r\\nMiri to be sold in Labuan. He said that under s. 154 and s. 155(1)(a) of the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act, Labuan is a duty free port, all cigarettes imported into Labuan\\r\\r\\nwere accorded with the status â\\x80\\x98Malaysia Duty Not Paidâ\\x80\\x99 and such cigarettes\\r\\r\\ncould only be sold in Labuan. He said any cigarettes transported or exported\\r\\r\\nfrom Labuan into Malaysia would be subject to duties under s. 155(1)(c) of\\r\\r\\nthe Customs Act. There are similar provisions in ss. 163A and 163B in\\r\\r\\nrespect of the duty free status of Langkawi.\\r\\r\\n[15] The IO affirmed that from his investigation there were 82 payments\\r\\r\\nmade into the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account bearing no. 3-0659180-25 at\\r\\r\\nPublic Bank in Labuan. Out of these, 81 payments were made via Public\\r\\r\\nBank in Miri and one via Public Bank in Kota Kinabalu. He said these 82\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n684\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\ndeposits or transactions made into this account in Labuan amounted to\\r\\r\\nRM2,675,090. Out of these, 16 deposits were via â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\r\\nbetween 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011.\\r\\r\\n[16] He said that he had interviewed one Toh Kah Tiong, who is the son\\r\\r\\nof the second respondent, and the elder brother of the Toh Kah Ming who\\r\\r\\nis the manager of the first respondent. He said Toh Kah Tiong told him that\\r\\r\\nToh Kah Ming had instructed Toh Kah Tiong to bank in RM68,800 into the\\r\\r\\naccount of the first respondent being the proceeds from the sales of cigarettes\\r\\r\\nwhich he received from a person from Brunei but he did not know where the\\r\\r\\nsales were carried out.\\r\\r\\n[17] He said from his investigation the first respondent had transferred\\r\\r\\nseveral big sums of money from this account in Labuan into the accounts of\\r\\r\\nthe third, fourth and fifth respondents, for example the sum of RM366,630\\r\\r\\ninto the bank account of the fourth respondent (see para. 18 of his first\\r\\r\\naffidavit). He said the 1st respondent had transferred a total of RM1,044,480\\r\\r\\ninto the bank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth respondents between\\r\\r\\n2009 and 2011. He said there was no explanation for these transfers or the\\r\\r\\npurposes for these transfers.\\r\\r\\n[18] The PP submitted that based on the transactions concerning these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts, the respondents did not and could not explain why the accounts did\\r\\r\\nnot tally with the buyersâ\\x80\\x99 account and statements. It was submitted that if the\\r\\r\\nsales were conducted in Labuan, as the respondents had contended, the\\r\\r\\nevidence showed that the payments were made outside Labuan via cash\\r\\r\\ndeposit slips made in Miri.\\r\\r\\n[19] The IO believed that from his investigation the first respondent had\\r\\r\\nexported or sold â\\x80\\x98Malaysia Duty Not Paidâ\\x80\\x99 cigarettes from Labuan via cash\\r\\r\\nsales or fictitious sales to unknown buyers in Malaysia. He said these sales\\r\\r\\nwere outside Labuan because the proceeds from the sales were paid in Miri\\r\\r\\nand Kota Kinabalu. The PP submitted that the acts of the respondents in\\r\\r\\nfailing to pay tax for the sales conducted outside Labuan had contravened the\\r\\r\\nprovisions of s. 135(1)(g) Customs Act and therefore an offence under s. 4(1)\\r\\r\\nof Act 613. The PP submitted that this is a case of smuggling.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[20] The PP submitted that it relied on documentary and circumstantial\\r\\r\\nevidence and that it had established its case against the respondents. The PP\\r\\r\\nsubmitted that the applicant only need to show that there was a link between\\r\\r\\nthe properties seized with the predicate and AMLATFA case in order to\\r\\r\\nestablish this application and that it has done so on a balance of probabilities,\\r\\r\\nalso referring to s. 56(4) of Act 613.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[21] The PP further submitted that by virtue of s. 119 of the Customs Act,\\r\\r\\nthe burden of proof was on the respondents to show that the respondents did\\r\\r\\nnot commit the offence as alleged by the applicant.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n685\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[22] The respondents submitted that it was the duty of the prosecution to\\r\\r\\nprove on a balance of probabilities that the monies in the various bank\\r\\r\\naccounts of the respondents seized were the subject matter of or used in the\\r\\r\\ncommission of an offence under s. 4(1) of Act 613.\\r\\r\\n[23] The respondents submitted that the first respondent is a private\\r\\r\\ncompany with the second to fifth respondents being the shareholders and\\r\\r\\ndirectors; that the first respondent did not have any third party or parties who\\r\\r\\nhave directly or indirectly invested sums of monies in it; and that the 1st\\r\\r\\nrespondentâ\\x80\\x99s business was purely selling duty free liquor and cigarettes in\\r\\r\\nLabuan.\\r\\r\\n[24] The respondents submitted that Toh Kah Ming had affirmed an\\r\\r\\naffidavit opposing the application stating that the goods at all times were sold\\r\\r\\nin Labuan and Langkawi, both duty free zones. The respondents referred to\\r\\r\\ns. 155(1), s. 158, s. 163B(1)(a) and s. 163B(1)(b) of the Customs Act that no\\r\\r\\nimport duty or export duty into Labuan and Langkawi shall be payable and\\r\\r\\nthat under s. 73(a) of the Sales Tax Act no sales tax shall be payable upon\\r\\r\\nany taxable goods imported into Labuan or transported into Labuan. The\\r\\r\\nrespondents submitted therefore they did not contravene the Customs Act.\\r\\r\\n[25] The respondents submitted that the respondentsâ\\x80\\x99 case was supported\\r\\r\\nby the investigation of the IO in para. 6 of the IOâ\\x80\\x99s first affidavit where he\\r\\r\\nsaid that from his investigation the first respondent either sold the cigarettes\\r\\r\\nin Labuan or using a Customs Form 8 via an associate company Orion Nova\\r\\r\\nin Langkawi. The respondents submitted that the investigation of the IO\\r\\r\\nconfirmed the respondentsâ\\x80\\x99 contention that the cigarettes were sold in\\r\\r\\nLabuan and Langkawi.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[26] The respondents submitted that the prosecution was not able to prove\\r\\r\\nthat the sales occurred outside Labuan. It was submitted that under Act 613\\r\\r\\nno presumption could be inferred from the deposits or payments made into\\r\\r\\nthe bank accounts of the first respondent in Labuan, which were made from\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan, meant that the sales were therefore made outside Labuan\\r\\r\\nand subject to duties or taxes. It similarly submitted that no such\\r\\r\\npresumption could be inferred from the cash sales that the sales were\\r\\r\\ntherefore made outside Labuan.\\r\\r\\n[27] It was submitted that in the absence of such presumptions, it was\\r\\r\\nincumbent on the prosecution to show actual evidence that the goods were\\r\\r\\nsold outside Labuan. The respondents submitted that the prosecution has\\r\\r\\nfailed to do so against the respondents and the application to forfeit the\\r\\r\\nproperties in the bank accounts of the respondents should be dismissed.\\r\\r\\n[28] In prayer 1(i) of the application, the PP applied to forfeit the sum of\\r\\r\\nRM195,573.67 in the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at\\r\\r\\nPublic Bank, Labuan. This sum was seized by the IO on 21 September 2012\\r\\r\\nunder s. 50(1) and pursuant to a notice of seizure under s. 51(1)(a) of Act 613\\r\\r\\n(see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 annexed to the second affidavit of the IO).

It did not state or refer to the sum of RM195,573.67 or any sum to\\r\\r\\nbe seized.\\r\\r\\n[29] The IO did not exhibit any bank statement or document nor produce\\r\\r\\nany evidence to establish that this sum of RM195,573.67 was in fact in the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at Public Bank, Labuan as\\r\\r\\nat 21 September 2012 which could be seized or could be forfeited. The IO\\r\\r\\ndid not explain why he included the fifth respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account No. 12067980-14 at Public Bank in this notice of seizure. He also did not explain\\r\\r\\nthe connection between these two accounts which he had seized under â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99.\\r\\r\\n[30] The IO also did not explain whether there was any connection\\r\\r\\nbetween the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at Public\\r\\r\\nBank, Labuan and the third respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 37560035192 at\\r\\r\\nHong Leong Islamic Bank, because both accounts purportedly contained\\r\\r\\nexactly the same sum ie, RM195,573.67 or whether it was a coincidence (see\\r\\r\\npara. 5(1) of the IOâ\\x80\\x99s second affidavit). Again the IO did not exhibit any bank\\r\\r\\nstatement to establish that this sum was in these two bank accounts.\\r\\r\\n[31] In respect of prayer 1(ii) of the application, the IO did not exhibit any\\r\\r\\nbank statement to establish that the sum of RM12,763.98 was in fact in the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 515120-201858 at Malayan Banking,\\r\\r\\nLabuan on 21 September 2012 which could be seized or could be forfeited\\r\\r\\n(see â\\x80\\x98AT2â\\x80\\x99).\\r\\r\\n[32] Based on paras. 8, 9 and 10 of the IOâ\\x80\\x99s first affidavit, the IO did not\\r\\r\\nrefer to and there was no evidence of any transaction or connection between\\r\\r\\nthe first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at Public Bank, Labuan\\r\\r\\nand the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 515120-201858 at Malayan\\r\\r\\nBanking (â\\x80\\x98Maybankâ\\x80\\x99), Labuan. He did not explain why he seized or wanted\\r\\r\\nto forfeit the money in this Maybank account belonging to the first\\r\\r\\nrespondent. He also did not explain the connection between this Maybank\\r\\r\\naccount of the first respondent and the Maybank account belonging to the\\r\\r\\nfourth respondent which he seized together as stated in â\\x80\\x98AT2â\\x80\\x99.\\r\\r\\n[33] Similarly, the exhibits marked as â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 to â\\x80\\x98AT8â\\x80\\x99 annexed to the\\r\\r\\nsecond affidavit of the IO merely referred to these bank accounts to be seized\\r\\r\\nwithout setting out the monies or sums which he had referred to in his\\r\\r\\naffidavits and whether these sums were in fact in these bank accounts. The\\r\\r\\nIO did not exhibit or produce any bank statements or documents to establish\\r\\r\\nthat these monies or sums were in the 23 bank accounts belonging to the\\r\\r\\nthird, fourth, and fifth respondents and which could be seized as at 21\\r\\r\\nSeptember 2012 or which could be forfeited in this application. Without\\r\\r\\nsuch documents to support his allegations or statements in his affidavits,\\r\\r\\nthere was no basis for the IO or PP to justify the seizures or forfeitures.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n687\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[34] It was not in dispute that these sums or proceeds were from the sales\\r\\r\\nof cigarettes and liquors. The question is did the respondents sell these\\r\\r\\ncigarettes in contravention of the Customs Act or were engaged in money\\r\\r\\nlaundering which entitled the PP to seize and to forfeit the sums in these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts? The PP had contended that the first respondent had sold cigarettes\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan. However there was no allegation that the second, third,\\r\\r\\nfourth and or fifth respondents had sold cigarettes outside Labuan.\\r\\r\\n[35] It should be noted that the PP did not set out and did not exhibit any\\r\\r\\nbank account of the second respondent. The PP did not seize any bank\\r\\r\\naccount of the second respondent and has not applied to forfeit any money\\r\\r\\nin any bank account of the second respondent. He did not lead any evidence\\r\\r\\nthat the second respondent was involved in selling duty free cigarettes or\\r\\r\\ninvolved in smuggling of duty free cigarettes or that he was involved in\\r\\r\\nmoney laundering. There was no explanation why the second respondent was\\r\\r\\nincluded in this application. There was no basis for the second respondent\\r\\r\\nto be included in this application and the PPâ\\x80\\x99s application against the second\\r\\r\\nrespondent ought to be and is hereby struck out.\\r\\r\\n[36] Although the PP contended that based on the documents exhibited that\\r\\r\\nthe cigarettes were sold outside Labuan, it did not lead any direct evidence\\r\\r\\nthat the first respondent and or the other respondents had transported or\\r\\r\\nexported duty free cigarettes from Labuan which were sold in Miri or Kota\\r\\r\\nKinabalu. It did not lead any evidence that the cigarettes were sold in\\r\\r\\nMalaysia, exclusive of Labuan and Langkawi. It did not lead evidence that\\r\\r\\nthese sales were intended to evade customs or import duty.\\r\\r\\n[37] From the affidavits and documents exhibited, the PP could not\\r\\r\\nestablish that these cigarettes were sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu or in\\r\\r\\nMalaysia, exclusive of Labuan and Langkawi. There was also no evidence\\r\\r\\nto substantiate the submissions of the PP that based on the payments made\\r\\r\\nin Miri that the cigarettes were sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n[38] In the modern business world, payments can be made or banked in or\\r\\r\\ntransferred from any bank account or any part of the world for transactions\\r\\r\\nor sales or purchases made in another part of the world, at the convenience\\r\\r\\nof the parties to the transactions or at the convenience of the payer and payee.\\r\\r\\nThe sales and purchases of goods, not in respect of duty free cigarettes\\r\\r\\ntransported from Labuan, can be transacted or made in Kuching and the\\r\\r\\npayments made in Miri. Similarly payments can be made in Miri or Kota\\r\\r\\nKinabalu for the sales and purchases of duty free cigarettes transacted or\\r\\r\\nmade in Labuan.\\r\\r\\n[39] The PP did not refer to any provisions or regulations under the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act or any legislation that duty free cigarettes sold in Labuan must\\r\\r\\nbe paid in Labuan or cannot be paid for in Miri or elsewhere. Similarly the\\r\\r\\nPP did not refer to any Bank Negara regulations or directives that duty free\\r\\r\\ncigarettes sold in Labuan must be paid in Labuan or cannot be paid for in\\r\\r\\nMiri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n688\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[40] The more important aspect of the sales and purchases was whether\\r\\r\\nthey were carried out in Labuan ie, whether the cigarettes were sold and\\r\\r\\ndelivered to the purchasers in Labuan. If the cigarettes were delivered by the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondent to the purchasers in Labuan, obviously the sales were made\\r\\r\\nin Labuan and the first respondent could not be subject to customs duty on\\r\\r\\nthe sales.\\r\\r\\n[41] The PP did not lead any evidence and there was no evidence that the\\r\\r\\ncigarettes in the 16 transactions described as â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99, which the\\r\\r\\nIO said were paid for in Miri, were sold or delivered to the purchasers\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan or in Miri or in Kota Kinabalu. It did not lead any evidence\\r\\r\\nand there was no evidence that the 82 payments or payments made into the\\r\\r\\nbank account no. 3-0659180-25 of the first respondent in Labuan were from\\r\\r\\nthe sales of duty free cigarettes transported from Labuan and delivered and\\r\\r\\nsold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu. It did not lead any evidence and there was\\r\\r\\nno evidence that the 82 payments made into the bank account of the first\\r\\r\\nrespondent in Labuan were from the proceeds of sales of duty free cigarettes\\r\\r\\ntransported from Labuan and delivered and sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n[42] Further, in respect of the sum of RM68,800 paid into the first\\r\\r\\nrespondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account in Labuan on 1 October 2010 via the first\\r\\r\\nrespondentâ\\x80\\x99s account at Public Bank, Miri, the PP submitted that it had\\r\\r\\nreason to believe that the sales occurred outside Labuan. Again this\\r\\r\\nsubmission was not supported by evidence. There was no provision in the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act against any sale outside of Labuan. Section 155(1)(b) provides\\r\\r\\nthat no export duty shall be payable upon any goods exported from Labuan.\\r\\r\\nHowever if the goods were imported or transported to Malaysia from Labuan\\r\\r\\nor Langkawi, then s. 155(1)(c) provides that import duty shall be payable\\r\\r\\nupon all dutiable goods transported to the principal customs area from\\r\\r\\nLabuan or Langkawi to all intents as if such transportation to the principal\\r\\r\\ncustoms area were importation into Malaysia.\\r\\r\\n[43] The IO had affirmed that Toh Kah Tiong had said that Toh Kah Ming\\r\\r\\nhad asked him to assist to collect this sum from a person from Brunei for the\\r\\r\\nsale and purchase of cigarettes but Toh Kah Tiong was not sure where the\\r\\r\\nsale took place because he was not involved in the business of the first\\r\\r\\nrespondent. Toh Kah Tiong had said this person from Brunei paid this sum\\r\\r\\nto him in Miri which he then paid into the account of the first respondent\\r\\r\\nin Labuan. There was no evidence to the contrary.\\r\\r\\n[44] In this particular sale, again the PP did not establish that the duty free\\r\\r\\ncigarettes from Labuan were sold in Malaysia. The PP did not establish that\\r\\r\\nthese cigarettes were exported from Labuan into Malaysia and were therefore\\r\\r\\nsubject to duties in contravention of the provisions of the Customs Act. The\\r\\r\\nPP did not establish that the sale involved the smuggling of these cigarettes\\r\\r\\nfrom Labuan into Malaysia. The PP did not establish that the cigarettes were\\r\\r\\nnot sold in Brunei. It also could not disprove that the cigarettes were\\r\\r\\nexported from Labuan to Brunei and sold in Brunei.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n689\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[45] Based on the statements of Toh Kah Tiong recorded by the IO, an\\r\\r\\ninference could be drawn that the cigarettes were exported from Labuan to\\r\\r\\nBrunei and sold in Brunei because it was paid for by a person from Brunei.\\r\\r\\nIf that was the case then no export duty was payable upon the cigarettes\\r\\r\\nexported from Labuan and sold in Brunei. This would contradict the\\r\\r\\ncontention of the PP that the cigarettes were sold in Miri. The PP has failed\\r\\r\\nto prove that the proceeds of RM68,800 from the sale of cigarettes had been\\r\\r\\nobtained as a result of or in connection with an offence under s. 4(1) of Act\\r\\r\\n613 or under the Customs Act.\\r\\r\\n[46] In prayer 1 (iii) to (xxv), the PP applied to forfeit the sums in the 23\\r\\r\\nbank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth respondents who were the\\r\\r\\nshareholders and directors of the first respondent. The PP submitted that the\\r\\r\\nthird, fourth and fifth respondents did not explain why so much monies were\\r\\r\\npaid into their accounts by the first respondent and whether these payments\\r\\r\\ninvolved money laundering or were derived from unlawful activities.\\r\\r\\n[47] Toh Kah Ming in her affidavits had explained that these were dividend\\r\\r\\npayments to the third, fourth and fifth respondents who were the\\r\\r\\nshareholders and directors of the first respondent.\\r\\r\\n[48] The balance sheet of the first respondent as at 30 June 2010 showed\\r\\r\\nthat the revenue for the year amounted to RM10,268,112.60 including cash\\r\\r\\nsales of cigarettes of RM8,124,963.40, the retained profits amounted to\\r\\r\\nRM2,966,884.61 and RM1,100,000 were paid out as dividends to the\\r\\r\\nshareholders (see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT4(a)â\\x80\\x99 of the first affidavit of the IO). The balance\\r\\r\\nsheet of the first respondent as at 30 June 2011 showed that the revenue for\\r\\r\\nthe year amounted to RM6,900,152.35, the retained profits amounted to\\r\\r\\nRM3,420,619.42 and RM1,600,000 were paid out as dividends to the\\r\\r\\nshareholders (see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT4(b)â\\x80\\x99 of the 1st affidavit of the IO).\\r\\r\\n[49] These documents were exhibited by the PP and would explain the\\r\\r\\nseveral payments into the bank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth\\r\\r\\nrespondents as dividends. The PP did not adduce any evidence to the\\r\\r\\ncontrary. These documents produced by PP would contradict the contention\\r\\r\\nof the PP that these payments were for the purposes of money laundering or\\r\\r\\nwere the proceeds of unlawful activities and raised doubts on the contentions\\r\\r\\nof the PP and the case of the PP against the respondents.\\r\\r\\n[50] The IO did not affirm that he is or was an accountant or an expert in\\r\\r\\naccounts or auditing or accounting or forensic accounting. The IO did not\\r\\r\\nconnect with each â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99 or each transaction or sale of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes, which he referred to in his affidavits, to each smuggling of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes or unlawful sales of cigarettes or which were in contravention of\\r\\r\\nthe Customs Act. The PP did not exhibit any report by any accountant or\\r\\r\\nexpert to trace or connect the entries in the ledgers or accounts with any\\r\\r\\nsmuggling of cigarettes or unlawful sales of cigarettes or that these proceeds\\r\\r\\nor payments or dividends were derived from unlawful activities or for money\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n690\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nlaundering. The IO did not produce any report from the Inland Revenue or\\r\\r\\nTax Department that the respondents had evaded income tax or other taxes\\r\\r\\nwhich contravened any law. There was no report by Public Bank, Maybank,\\r\\r\\nHong Leong Bank or Bank Negara or any other banks that these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts or that the proceeds in these bank accounts involved money\\r\\r\\nlaundering.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[51] As stated above, the PP could not show on a balance of probabilities\\r\\r\\nthat duty free cigarettes were transported from Labuan or Langkawi and were\\r\\r\\ndelivered or sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu or in other regions in Malaysia.\\r\\r\\nThe PP could not show that there were smuggling of cigarettes from Labuan\\r\\r\\ninto Miri or Kota Kinabalu in contravention of the provisions of the Customs\\r\\r\\nAct. The PP could not show that these payments for the cigarettes sold and\\r\\r\\npaid into the account of the first respondent at Labuan were proceeds from\\r\\r\\nunlawful activities. The PP could not show that these transactions or\\r\\r\\npayments into the bank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth respondents\\r\\r\\nwere proceeds from unlawful activities and not payments as dividends.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[52] It should be noted that the respondents had not been charged for any\\r\\r\\noffence nor convicted for any offence under the Customs Act. Therefore\\r\\r\\ns. 119 of the Customs Act is not applicable to reverse the burden on the\\r\\r\\nrespondents to show that they did not commit the offence or were involved\\r\\r\\nin money laundering under s. 4(1) of Act 613.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[53] On the affidavits and documents, the PP has failed to establish on a\\r\\r\\nbalance of probabilities that the respondents were involved in money\\r\\r\\nlaundering or in unlawful activities or that the proceeds in these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts were or are the proceeds from unlawful activities or for the\\r\\r\\npurposes of money laundering.

The sum had been obtained as\\r\\r\\na result of alleged smuggling activities carried out by the respondents. The\\r\\r\\nPP did not institute any prosecution against the respondents for any offence\\r\\r\\nand none of them had been convicted for any offence under the Customs Act\\r\\r\\n1967 (â\\x80\\x98the Actâ\\x80\\x99). The PP submitted that based on investigation by the\\r\\r\\ninvestigating officer (â\\x80\\x98IOâ\\x80\\x99), the first respondent sold cigarettes and liquor to\\r\\r\\nbuyers at a place outside Labuan, which was an offence under s. 135(1)(g)\\r\\r\\nof the Act. Sixteen deposits made into the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s account were\\r\\r\\nstated as â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99. The first respondent then transferred several\\r\\r\\nbig sums of money from its account into the accounts of the third, fourth and\\r\\r\\nfifth respondents which totalled up to RM1,044,480. According to the PP,\\r\\r\\nthe respondents could not explain why the accounts did not tally with the\\r\\r\\nbuyersâ\\x80\\x99 account and statements. The first respondent had allegedly exported\\r\\r\\nor sold duty free cigarettes from Labuan to unknown buyers in Malaysia.\\r\\r\\nThe proceeds from the sales were paid in Miri and Kota Kinabalu and the\\r\\r\\nPP submitted that the acts of the respondents in failing to pay tax for the sales\\r\\r\\nformed a case of smuggling and contravened s. 135(1)(g) of the Act. The\\r\\r\\nissues that arose for the courtâ\\x80\\x99s determination were: (i) whether the\\r\\r\\nrespondents sold the cigarettes in contravention of the Act or were engaged\\r\\r\\nin money laundering which entitled the PP to seize and to forfeit the sums\\r\\r\\nin the bank account; and (ii) whether the cigarettes were sold and delivered\\r\\r\\nto the purchasers in Labuan.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n679\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nHeld (dismissing application):\\r\\r\\n(1) The freezing or seizures of the accounts were set aside. The PP failed\\r\\r\\nto establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the respondents were\\r\\r\\ninvolved in money laundering or in unlawful activities or that the\\r\\r\\nproceeds in the bank accounts were or are the proceeds from unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivities or for the purpose of money laundering. (para 53)\\r\\r\\n(2) There was no explanation as to why the second respondent was included\\r\\r\\nin this application. The PP did not seize any bank account of the second\\r\\r\\nrespondent and had not applied to forfeit any money in any bank\\r\\r\\naccount of the second respondent. There was no evidence led that the\\r\\r\\nsecond respondent was involved in selling duty free cigarettes or\\r\\r\\ninvolved in smuggling them or that he was involved in money\\r\\r\\nlaundering. The application against the second respondent ought to be\\r\\r\\nstruck out. (para 35)\\r\\r\\n(3) Although the PP contended that based on documents exhibited, the\\r\\r\\ncigarettes were sold outside Labuan, no direct evidence was led that the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondent and/or the other respondents had transported or\\r\\r\\nexported duty free cigarettes from Labuan which were sold in Miri or\\r\\r\\nKota Kinabalu. There was also no evidence led that the cigarettes were\\r\\r\\nsold in Malaysia and that they were intended to evade customs or import\\r\\r\\nduty. (para 36)\\r\\r\\n(4) There was no evidence that the cigarettes in the 16 transactions\\r\\r\\ndescribed as â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99 which the IO said were paid for in\\r\\r\\nMiri, were sold or delivered to the purchasers outside Labuan or in Miri\\r\\r\\nor Kota Kinabalu. Furthermore, the PP did not refer to any provision\\r\\r\\nor regulations under the Act or any legislation that duty free cigarettes\\r\\r\\nsold in Labuan must be paid in Labuan or could not be paid for in Miri\\r\\r\\nor elsewhere. Similarly, the PP did not refer to any Bank Negara\\r\\r\\nregulations or directives that duty free cigarettes sold in Labuan must be\\r\\r\\npaid in Labuan or could not be paid in Miri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n(paras 39 & 41)\\r\\r\\n(5) There is no provision in the Act against any sale outside Labuan. Section\\r\\r\\n155(1)(b) of the Act provides that no export duty shall be payable upon\\r\\r\\nany goods exported from Labuan. If the goods were imported or\\r\\r\\ntransported to Malaysia from Labuan or Langkawi, then s. 155(1)(c)\\r\\r\\nprovides that import duty shall be payable upon all dutiable goods\\r\\r\\ntransported to the principal customs area from Labuan or Langkawi to\\r\\r\\nall intents as if such transportation to the principal customs area were\\r\\r\\nimportation into Malaysia (para 42).\\r\\r\\n(6) The IO did not affirm that he is or was an accountant or an expert in\\r\\r\\naccounts or auditing or accounting or forensic accounting. The IO did\\r\\r\\nnot connect with each â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99 or each transaction or sale of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes to each smuggling of cigarettes or unlawful sales of cigarettes\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n680\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nor which were in contravention of the Act. The PP did not exhibit any\\r\\r\\nreport by any accountant or expert to trace or connect the entries in the\\r\\r\\nledgers or accounts with any smuggling of cigarettes or unlawful sales of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes or that these proceeds or payments were derived from\\r\\r\\nunlawful activities or for money laundering (para 50).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n(7) The IO did not produce any report from the Inland Revenue or Tax\\r\\r\\nDepartment that the respondents had evaded income tax or other taxes\\r\\r\\nwhich contravened any law. There was no report by Bank Negara or any\\r\\r\\nother banks that these bank accounts or the proceeds in the bank\\r\\r\\naccounts were involved in money laundering. Hence, the PP could not\\r\\r\\nshow that the transactions or payments into the bank accounts of the\\r\\r\\nthird, fourth and fifth respondents were proceeds from unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivities (paras 50 & 51).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCase(s) referred to:\\r\\r\\nPP v.

The PP accordingly applied under s. 56(1) of Act 613\\r\\r\\nthat the monies in the 25 bank accounts be forfeited because such properties\\r\\r\\nhad been obtained as a result of or in connection with an offence of money\\r\\r\\nlaundering under s. 4(1) of the Act.\\r\\r\\n[4]\\r\\r\\nReading the application, affidavits and submissions, the PP submitted\\r\\r\\nthat based on an investigation conducted by the IO the first respondent sold\\r\\r\\ncigarettes and liquor to buyers where the transactions occurred at a place\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan and that the respondents had committed an offence under\\r\\r\\ns.135(1)(g) of the Customs Act by knowingly being concerned in fraudulent\\r\\r\\nevasion or attempt at fraudulent evasion of customs duty or in evasion or\\r\\r\\nattempt at evasion of any prohibition of import or export.

The second affidavit of the IO which\\r\\r\\nwas affirmed on the same date and time was annexed to the first affidavit and\\r\\r\\nmarked as exh. â\\x80\\x98AT10 (4)â\\x80\\x99. However the exhibits attached to the second\\r\\r\\naffidavit were similarly marked as exhs. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 until â\\x80\\x98AT8â\\x80\\x99. When the IO\\r\\r\\nreferred to exh. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99, he did not explain which â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 he was referring to.\\r\\r\\nAny exhibits to be marked must be in running numbers and not be repeated\\r\\r\\nto avoid confusion.\\r\\r\\n[6]\\r\\r\\nFurther, the PP exhibited about 1,000 pages of the ledgers, trial\\r\\r\\nbalances and balance sheets of the first respondent annexed to the affidavits\\r\\r\\nof the IO. However there was no pagination for easy reference. When the IO\\r\\r\\nreferred to a certain entry or entries in the ledger, he did not refer to the page\\r\\r\\nwhere the entries appeared in the ledger, the significance of the entries and\\r\\r\\nwhether these involved or were connected with money laundering.\\r\\r\\n[7]\\r\\r\\nAct 613 is an Act to provide for the offence of money laundering, the\\r\\r\\nmeasures to be taken for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism\\r\\r\\nfinancing offences and to provide for the forfeiture of terrorist property and\\r\\r\\nproperty involved in, or derived from, money laundering and terrorism\\r\\r\\nfinancing offences, and for matters incidental thereto and connected\\r\\r\\ntherewith. Section 2(1) states that this Act shall apply to any serious offence,\\r\\r\\nforeign serious offence or unlawful activity whether committed before or\\r\\r\\nafter the commencement date of this Act. â\\x80\\x9cSerious offenceâ\\x80\\x9d means any of the\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n682\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\noffences specified in the Second Schedule or an attempt to commit any of\\r\\r\\nthose offences or the abetment of any of those offences. Section 135 of the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act has been included in the Second Schedule as one of the serious\\r\\r\\noffences. Section 2(2) provides that this Act shall apply to any property,\\r\\r\\nwhether it is situated in or outside Malaysia.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[8]\\r\\r\\nSection 4(1) of Act 613 provides for an offence of money laundering\\r\\r\\nwhich states that any person who (a) engages in, or attempts to engage in; or\\r\\r\\n(b) abets the commission of, money laundering, commits an offence. In the\\r\\r\\ndefinition section, money laundering is defined as the act of a person who:\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n(a) engages, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that involves\\r\\r\\nproceeds of any unlawful activity;\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n(b) acquires, receives, possesses, disguises, transfers, converts,\\r\\r\\nexchanges, carries, disposes, uses, removes from or brings into\\r\\r\\nMalaysia proceeds of any unlawful activity; or\\r\\r\\n(c) conceals, disguises or impedes the establishment of the true nature,\\r\\r\\norigin, location, movement, disposition, title of, rights with respect\\r\\r\\nto, or ownership of, proceeds of any unlawful activity;\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\r\\n(aa) as may be inferred from objective factual circumstance, the\\r\\r\\nperson knows or has reason to believe, that the property is\\r\\r\\nproceeds from any 1 unlawful activity; or\\r\\r\\n(bb) in respect of the conduct of a natural person, the person without\\r\\r\\nreasonable excuse fails to take reasonable steps to ascertain\\r\\r\\nwhether or not the property is proceeds from any unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivity ...\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[9]\\r\\r\\nThere are two parts in this definition. Firstly, the act of a person who\\r\\r\\ninter alia engages in a transaction that involves proceeds of any unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivity or receives proceeds of any unlawful activity and secondly he knows\\r\\r\\nor has reason to believe that the property is proceeds from any unlawful\\r\\r\\nactivity or fails to take reasonable steps to ascertain whether or not the\\r\\r\\nproperty is proceeds from any unlawful activity. The burden is on the PP to\\r\\r\\nprove both these ingredients using the standard of proof required in civil\\r\\r\\nproceedings: see s. 56(4) of Act 613; Pendakwa Raya v. V Alexandra a/l Chako\\r\\r\\nVanglise (and another case) [2010] 8 AMR 159.\\r\\r\\n[10] Under s. 56(1), in respect of any property frozen or seized under this\\r\\r\\nAct where there is no prosecution or conviction for an offence under\\r\\r\\nsub-s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence, the Public Prosecutor may,\\r\\r\\nbefore the expiration of 12 months from the date of the freeze or seizure,\\r\\r\\napply to a judge of the High Court for an order of forfeiture of that property\\r\\r\\nif he is satisfied that such property had been obtained as a result of or in\\r\\r\\nconnection with an offence under sub-s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence,\\r\\r\\nas the case may be, or is terrorist property.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n683\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[11] Section 56(2) states that the judge to whom an application is made\\r\\r\\nunder sub-s. (1) shall make an order for the forfeiture of the property if he\\r\\r\\nis satisfied:\\r\\r\\n(a) that the property is the subject matter of or was used in the commission\\r\\r\\nof an offence under sub-s. 4(1) or a terrorism financing offence or is\\r\\r\\nterrorist property;\\r\\r\\n(b) that there is no purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration in\\r\\r\\nrespect of the property.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nUnder s. 56(3) any property that has been seized and in respect of which no\\r\\r\\napplication is made under sub-s. (1) shall, at the expiration of 12 months\\r\\r\\nfrom the date of its seizure, be released to the person from whom it was\\r\\r\\nseized. The bank accounts were seized on 21 September 2012 and this\\r\\r\\napplication for forfeiture was made on 19 September 2013. There was no\\r\\r\\nobjection or complaint by the respondents that it was outside the 12 months\\r\\r\\nas provided in s. 56 of Act 613: see PP v. Dragcom Sdn Bhd & Ors and Other\\r\\r\\nCases [2013] 10 CLJ 628; [2013] 5 MLJ 594.\\r\\r\\n[12] Under s. 61(2) of Act 613 the judge to whom an application is made\\r\\r\\nunder s. 56(1) shall cause to be published a notice in the Gazette calling upon\\r\\r\\nany third party who claims to have any interest in the property to attend\\r\\r\\nbefore the court on the date specified in the notice to show cause as to why\\r\\r\\nthe property shall not be forfeited. After the Gazette was published, no third\\r\\r\\nparty had come forward to claim any of the monies in these accounts except\\r\\r\\nthe respondents who held these accounts. Therefore the provisions of s. 61(4)\\r\\r\\nare not applicable to this application for the forfeiture of the proceeds in these\\r\\r\\n25 accounts.\\r\\r\\n[13] In his first affidavit, the IO affirmed that the first respondent was\\r\\r\\nincorporated with an address in Labuan and with its business to import and\\r\\r\\nexport beers, liquors and cigarettes. The other respondents were the\\r\\r\\nshareholders and directors of the first respondent (see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99).\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[14] He affirmed that from his investigation the 1st respondent had bought\\r\\r\\ncigarettes from two companies ie, Lihan Trading and Syarikat Jayapuri in\\r\\r\\nMiri to be sold in Labuan. He said that under s. 154 and s. 155(1)(a) of the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act, Labuan is a duty free port, all cigarettes imported into Labuan\\r\\r\\nwere accorded with the status â\\x80\\x98Malaysia Duty Not Paidâ\\x80\\x99 and such cigarettes\\r\\r\\ncould only be sold in Labuan. He said any cigarettes transported or exported\\r\\r\\nfrom Labuan into Malaysia would be subject to duties under s. 155(1)(c) of\\r\\r\\nthe Customs Act. There are similar provisions in ss. 163A and 163B in\\r\\r\\nrespect of the duty free status of Langkawi.\\r\\r\\n[15] The IO affirmed that from his investigation there were 82 payments\\r\\r\\nmade into the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account bearing no. 3-0659180-25 at\\r\\r\\nPublic Bank in Labuan. Out of these, 81 payments were made via Public\\r\\r\\nBank in Miri and one via Public Bank in Kota Kinabalu. He said these 82\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n684\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\ndeposits or transactions made into this account in Labuan amounted to\\r\\r\\nRM2,675,090. Out of these, 16 deposits were via â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\r\\nbetween 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011.\\r\\r\\n[16] He said that he had interviewed one Toh Kah Tiong, who is the son\\r\\r\\nof the second respondent, and the elder brother of the Toh Kah Ming who\\r\\r\\nis the manager of the first respondent. He said Toh Kah Tiong told him that\\r\\r\\nToh Kah Ming had instructed Toh Kah Tiong to bank in RM68,800 into the\\r\\r\\naccount of the first respondent being the proceeds from the sales of cigarettes\\r\\r\\nwhich he received from a person from Brunei but he did not know where the\\r\\r\\nsales were carried out.\\r\\r\\n[17] He said from his investigation the first respondent had transferred\\r\\r\\nseveral big sums of money from this account in Labuan into the accounts of\\r\\r\\nthe third, fourth and fifth respondents, for example the sum of RM366,630\\r\\r\\ninto the bank account of the fourth respondent (see para. 18 of his first\\r\\r\\naffidavit). He said the 1st respondent had transferred a total of RM1,044,480\\r\\r\\ninto the bank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth respondents between\\r\\r\\n2009 and 2011. He said there was no explanation for these transfers or the\\r\\r\\npurposes for these transfers.\\r\\r\\n[18] The PP submitted that based on the transactions concerning these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts, the respondents did not and could not explain why the accounts did\\r\\r\\nnot tally with the buyersâ\\x80\\x99 account and statements. It was submitted that if the\\r\\r\\nsales were conducted in Labuan, as the respondents had contended, the\\r\\r\\nevidence showed that the payments were made outside Labuan via cash\\r\\r\\ndeposit slips made in Miri.\\r\\r\\n[19] The IO believed that from his investigation the first respondent had\\r\\r\\nexported or sold â\\x80\\x98Malaysia Duty Not Paidâ\\x80\\x99 cigarettes from Labuan via cash\\r\\r\\nsales or fictitious sales to unknown buyers in Malaysia. He said these sales\\r\\r\\nwere outside Labuan because the proceeds from the sales were paid in Miri\\r\\r\\nand Kota Kinabalu. The PP submitted that the acts of the respondents in\\r\\r\\nfailing to pay tax for the sales conducted outside Labuan had contravened the\\r\\r\\nprovisions of s. 135(1)(g) Customs Act and therefore an offence under s. 4(1)\\r\\r\\nof Act 613. The PP submitted that this is a case of smuggling.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[20] The PP submitted that it relied on documentary and circumstantial\\r\\r\\nevidence and that it had established its case against the respondents. The PP\\r\\r\\nsubmitted that the applicant only need to show that there was a link between\\r\\r\\nthe properties seized with the predicate and AMLATFA case in order to\\r\\r\\nestablish this application and that it has done so on a balance of probabilities,\\r\\r\\nalso referring to s. 56(4) of Act 613.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[21] The PP further submitted that by virtue of s. 119 of the Customs Act,\\r\\r\\nthe burden of proof was on the respondents to show that the respondents did\\r\\r\\nnot commit the offence as alleged by the applicant.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n685\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[22] The respondents submitted that it was the duty of the prosecution to\\r\\r\\nprove on a balance of probabilities that the monies in the various bank\\r\\r\\naccounts of the respondents seized were the subject matter of or used in the\\r\\r\\ncommission of an offence under s. 4(1) of Act 613.\\r\\r\\n[23] The respondents submitted that the first respondent is a private\\r\\r\\ncompany with the second to fifth respondents being the shareholders and\\r\\r\\ndirectors; that the first respondent did not have any third party or parties who\\r\\r\\nhave directly or indirectly invested sums of monies in it; and that the 1st\\r\\r\\nrespondentâ\\x80\\x99s business was purely selling duty free liquor and cigarettes in\\r\\r\\nLabuan.\\r\\r\\n[24] The respondents submitted that Toh Kah Ming had affirmed an\\r\\r\\naffidavit opposing the application stating that the goods at all times were sold\\r\\r\\nin Labuan and Langkawi, both duty free zones. The respondents referred to\\r\\r\\ns. 155(1), s. 158, s. 163B(1)(a) and s. 163B(1)(b) of the Customs Act that no\\r\\r\\nimport duty or export duty into Labuan and Langkawi shall be payable and\\r\\r\\nthat under s. 73(a) of the Sales Tax Act no sales tax shall be payable upon\\r\\r\\nany taxable goods imported into Labuan or transported into Labuan. The\\r\\r\\nrespondents submitted therefore they did not contravene the Customs Act.\\r\\r\\n[25] The respondents submitted that the respondentsâ\\x80\\x99 case was supported\\r\\r\\nby the investigation of the IO in para. 6 of the IOâ\\x80\\x99s first affidavit where he\\r\\r\\nsaid that from his investigation the first respondent either sold the cigarettes\\r\\r\\nin Labuan or using a Customs Form 8 via an associate company Orion Nova\\r\\r\\nin Langkawi. The respondents submitted that the investigation of the IO\\r\\r\\nconfirmed the respondentsâ\\x80\\x99 contention that the cigarettes were sold in\\r\\r\\nLabuan and Langkawi.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[26] The respondents submitted that the prosecution was not able to prove\\r\\r\\nthat the sales occurred outside Labuan. It was submitted that under Act 613\\r\\r\\nno presumption could be inferred from the deposits or payments made into\\r\\r\\nthe bank accounts of the first respondent in Labuan, which were made from\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan, meant that the sales were therefore made outside Labuan\\r\\r\\nand subject to duties or taxes. It similarly submitted that no such\\r\\r\\npresumption could be inferred from the cash sales that the sales were\\r\\r\\ntherefore made outside Labuan.\\r\\r\\n[27] It was submitted that in the absence of such presumptions, it was\\r\\r\\nincumbent on the prosecution to show actual evidence that the goods were\\r\\r\\nsold outside Labuan. The respondents submitted that the prosecution has\\r\\r\\nfailed to do so against the respondents and the application to forfeit the\\r\\r\\nproperties in the bank accounts of the respondents should be dismissed.\\r\\r\\n[28] In prayer 1(i) of the application, the PP applied to forfeit the sum of\\r\\r\\nRM195,573.67 in the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at\\r\\r\\nPublic Bank, Labuan. This sum was seized by the IO on 21 September 2012\\r\\r\\nunder s. 50(1) and pursuant to a notice of seizure under s. 51(1)(a) of Act 613\\r\\r\\n(see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 annexed to the second affidavit of the IO). This exh. 1\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n686\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nreferred to the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-2 0659180-25 at Public\\r\\r\\nBank and the fifth respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 1-2067980-14 at Public\\r\\r\\nBank. It did not state or refer to the sum of RM195,573.67 or any sum to\\r\\r\\nbe seized.\\r\\r\\n[29] The IO did not exhibit any bank statement or document nor produce\\r\\r\\nany evidence to establish that this sum of RM195,573.67 was in fact in the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at Public Bank, Labuan as\\r\\r\\nat 21 September 2012 which could be seized or could be forfeited. The IO\\r\\r\\ndid not explain why he included the fifth respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account No. 12067980-14 at Public Bank in this notice of seizure. He also did not explain\\r\\r\\nthe connection between these two accounts which he had seized under â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99.\\r\\r\\n[30] The IO also did not explain whether there was any connection\\r\\r\\nbetween the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at Public\\r\\r\\nBank, Labuan and the third respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 37560035192 at\\r\\r\\nHong Leong Islamic Bank, because both accounts purportedly contained\\r\\r\\nexactly the same sum ie, RM195,573.67 or whether it was a coincidence (see\\r\\r\\npara. 5(1) of the IOâ\\x80\\x99s second affidavit). Again the IO did not exhibit any bank\\r\\r\\nstatement to establish that this sum was in these two bank accounts.\\r\\r\\n[31] In respect of prayer 1(ii) of the application, the IO did not exhibit any\\r\\r\\nbank statement to establish that the sum of RM12,763.98 was in fact in the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 515120-201858 at Malayan Banking,\\r\\r\\nLabuan on 21 September 2012 which could be seized or could be forfeited\\r\\r\\n(see â\\x80\\x98AT2â\\x80\\x99).\\r\\r\\n[32] Based on paras. 8, 9 and 10 of the IOâ\\x80\\x99s first affidavit, the IO did not\\r\\r\\nrefer to and there was no evidence of any transaction or connection between\\r\\r\\nthe first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 3-0659180-25 at Public Bank, Labuan\\r\\r\\nand the first respondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account no. 515120-201858 at Malayan\\r\\r\\nBanking (â\\x80\\x98Maybankâ\\x80\\x99), Labuan. He did not explain why he seized or wanted\\r\\r\\nto forfeit the money in this Maybank account belonging to the first\\r\\r\\nrespondent. He also did not explain the connection between this Maybank\\r\\r\\naccount of the first respondent and the Maybank account belonging to the\\r\\r\\nfourth respondent which he seized together as stated in â\\x80\\x98AT2â\\x80\\x99.\\r\\r\\n[33] Similarly, the exhibits marked as â\\x80\\x98AT1â\\x80\\x99 to â\\x80\\x98AT8â\\x80\\x99 annexed to the\\r\\r\\nsecond affidavit of the IO merely referred to these bank accounts to be seized\\r\\r\\nwithout setting out the monies or sums which he had referred to in his\\r\\r\\naffidavits and whether these sums were in fact in these bank accounts. The\\r\\r\\nIO did not exhibit or produce any bank statements or documents to establish\\r\\r\\nthat these monies or sums were in the 23 bank accounts belonging to the\\r\\r\\nthird, fourth, and fifth respondents and which could be seized as at 21\\r\\r\\nSeptember 2012 or which could be forfeited in this application. Without\\r\\r\\nsuch documents to support his allegations or statements in his affidavits,\\r\\r\\nthere was no basis for the IO or PP to justify the seizures or forfeitures.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n687\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[34] It was not in dispute that these sums or proceeds were from the sales\\r\\r\\nof cigarettes and liquors. The question is did the respondents sell these\\r\\r\\ncigarettes in contravention of the Customs Act or were engaged in money\\r\\r\\nlaundering which entitled the PP to seize and to forfeit the sums in these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts? The PP had contended that the first respondent had sold cigarettes\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan. However there was no allegation that the second, third,\\r\\r\\nfourth and or fifth respondents had sold cigarettes outside Labuan.\\r\\r\\n[35] It should be noted that the PP did not set out and did not exhibit any\\r\\r\\nbank account of the second respondent. The PP did not seize any bank\\r\\r\\naccount of the second respondent and has not applied to forfeit any money\\r\\r\\nin any bank account of the second respondent. He did not lead any evidence\\r\\r\\nthat the second respondent was involved in selling duty free cigarettes or\\r\\r\\ninvolved in smuggling of duty free cigarettes or that he was involved in\\r\\r\\nmoney laundering. There was no explanation why the second respondent was\\r\\r\\nincluded in this application. There was no basis for the second respondent\\r\\r\\nto be included in this application and the PPâ\\x80\\x99s application against the second\\r\\r\\nrespondent ought to be and is hereby struck out.\\r\\r\\n[36] Although the PP contended that based on the documents exhibited that\\r\\r\\nthe cigarettes were sold outside Labuan, it did not lead any direct evidence\\r\\r\\nthat the first respondent and or the other respondents had transported or\\r\\r\\nexported duty free cigarettes from Labuan which were sold in Miri or Kota\\r\\r\\nKinabalu. It did not lead any evidence that the cigarettes were sold in\\r\\r\\nMalaysia, exclusive of Labuan and Langkawi. It did not lead evidence that\\r\\r\\nthese sales were intended to evade customs or import duty.\\r\\r\\n[37] From the affidavits and documents exhibited, the PP could not\\r\\r\\nestablish that these cigarettes were sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu or in\\r\\r\\nMalaysia, exclusive of Labuan and Langkawi. There was also no evidence\\r\\r\\nto substantiate the submissions of the PP that based on the payments made\\r\\r\\nin Miri that the cigarettes were sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n[38] In the modern business world, payments can be made or banked in or\\r\\r\\ntransferred from any bank account or any part of the world for transactions\\r\\r\\nor sales or purchases made in another part of the world, at the convenience\\r\\r\\nof the parties to the transactions or at the convenience of the payer and payee.\\r\\r\\nThe sales and purchases of goods, not in respect of duty free cigarettes\\r\\r\\ntransported from Labuan, can be transacted or made in Kuching and the\\r\\r\\npayments made in Miri. Similarly payments can be made in Miri or Kota\\r\\r\\nKinabalu for the sales and purchases of duty free cigarettes transacted or\\r\\r\\nmade in Labuan.\\r\\r\\n[39] The PP did not refer to any provisions or regulations under the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act or any legislation that duty free cigarettes sold in Labuan must\\r\\r\\nbe paid in Labuan or cannot be paid for in Miri or elsewhere. Similarly the\\r\\r\\nPP did not refer to any Bank Negara regulations or directives that duty free\\r\\r\\ncigarettes sold in Labuan must be paid in Labuan or cannot be paid for in\\r\\r\\nMiri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n688\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[40] The more important aspect of the sales and purchases was whether\\r\\r\\nthey were carried out in Labuan ie, whether the cigarettes were sold and\\r\\r\\ndelivered to the purchasers in Labuan. If the cigarettes were delivered by the\\r\\r\\nfirst respondent to the purchasers in Labuan, obviously the sales were made\\r\\r\\nin Labuan and the first respondent could not be subject to customs duty on\\r\\r\\nthe sales.\\r\\r\\n[41] The PP did not lead any evidence and there was no evidence that the\\r\\r\\ncigarettes in the 16 transactions described as â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99, which the\\r\\r\\nIO said were paid for in Miri, were sold or delivered to the purchasers\\r\\r\\noutside Labuan or in Miri or in Kota Kinabalu. It did not lead any evidence\\r\\r\\nand there was no evidence that the 82 payments or payments made into the\\r\\r\\nbank account no. 3-0659180-25 of the first respondent in Labuan were from\\r\\r\\nthe sales of duty free cigarettes transported from Labuan and delivered and\\r\\r\\nsold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu. It did not lead any evidence and there was\\r\\r\\nno evidence that the 82 payments made into the bank account of the first\\r\\r\\nrespondent in Labuan were from the proceeds of sales of duty free cigarettes\\r\\r\\ntransported from Labuan and delivered and sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu.\\r\\r\\n[42] Further, in respect of the sum of RM68,800 paid into the first\\r\\r\\nrespondentâ\\x80\\x99s bank account in Labuan on 1 October 2010 via the first\\r\\r\\nrespondentâ\\x80\\x99s account at Public Bank, Miri, the PP submitted that it had\\r\\r\\nreason to believe that the sales occurred outside Labuan. Again this\\r\\r\\nsubmission was not supported by evidence. There was no provision in the\\r\\r\\nCustoms Act against any sale outside of Labuan. Section 155(1)(b) provides\\r\\r\\nthat no export duty shall be payable upon any goods exported from Labuan.\\r\\r\\nHowever if the goods were imported or transported to Malaysia from Labuan\\r\\r\\nor Langkawi, then s. 155(1)(c) provides that import duty shall be payable\\r\\r\\nupon all dutiable goods transported to the principal customs area from\\r\\r\\nLabuan or Langkawi to all intents as if such transportation to the principal\\r\\r\\ncustoms area were importation into Malaysia.\\r\\r\\n[43] The IO had affirmed that Toh Kah Tiong had said that Toh Kah Ming\\r\\r\\nhad asked him to assist to collect this sum from a person from Brunei for the\\r\\r\\nsale and purchase of cigarettes but Toh Kah Tiong was not sure where the\\r\\r\\nsale took place because he was not involved in the business of the first\\r\\r\\nrespondent. Toh Kah Tiong had said this person from Brunei paid this sum\\r\\r\\nto him in Miri which he then paid into the account of the first respondent\\r\\r\\nin Labuan. There was no evidence to the contrary.\\r\\r\\n[44] In this particular sale, again the PP did not establish that the duty free\\r\\r\\ncigarettes from Labuan were sold in Malaysia. The PP did not establish that\\r\\r\\nthese cigarettes were exported from Labuan into Malaysia and were therefore\\r\\r\\nsubject to duties in contravention of the provisions of the Customs Act. The\\r\\r\\nPP did not establish that the sale involved the smuggling of these cigarettes\\r\\r\\nfrom Labuan into Malaysia. The PP did not establish that the cigarettes were\\r\\r\\nnot sold in Brunei. It also could not disprove that the cigarettes were\\r\\r\\nexported from Labuan to Brunei and sold in Brunei.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nC\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nF\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nG\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nH\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPP v. Billion Nova Sdn Bhd & Ors\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n689\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[45] Based on the statements of Toh Kah Tiong recorded by the IO, an\\r\\r\\ninference could be drawn that the cigarettes were exported from Labuan to\\r\\r\\nBrunei and sold in Brunei because it was paid for by a person from Brunei.\\r\\r\\nIf that was the case then no export duty was payable upon the cigarettes\\r\\r\\nexported from Labuan and sold in Brunei. This would contradict the\\r\\r\\ncontention of the PP that the cigarettes were sold in Miri. The PP has failed\\r\\r\\nto prove that the proceeds of RM68,800 from the sale of cigarettes had been\\r\\r\\nobtained as a result of or in connection with an offence under s. 4(1) of Act\\r\\r\\n613 or under the Customs Act.\\r\\r\\n[46] In prayer 1 (iii) to (xxv), the PP applied to forfeit the sums in the 23\\r\\r\\nbank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth respondents who were the\\r\\r\\nshareholders and directors of the first respondent. The PP submitted that the\\r\\r\\nthird, fourth and fifth respondents did not explain why so much monies were\\r\\r\\npaid into their accounts by the first respondent and whether these payments\\r\\r\\ninvolved money laundering or were derived from unlawful activities.\\r\\r\\n[47] Toh Kah Ming in her affidavits had explained that these were dividend\\r\\r\\npayments to the third, fourth and fifth respondents who were the\\r\\r\\nshareholders and directors of the first respondent.\\r\\r\\n[48] The balance sheet of the first respondent as at 30 June 2010 showed\\r\\r\\nthat the revenue for the year amounted to RM10,268,112.60 including cash\\r\\r\\nsales of cigarettes of RM8,124,963.40, the retained profits amounted to\\r\\r\\nRM2,966,884.61 and RM1,100,000 were paid out as dividends to the\\r\\r\\nshareholders (see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT4(a)â\\x80\\x99 of the first affidavit of the IO). The balance\\r\\r\\nsheet of the first respondent as at 30 June 2011 showed that the revenue for\\r\\r\\nthe year amounted to RM6,900,152.35, the retained profits amounted to\\r\\r\\nRM3,420,619.42 and RM1,600,000 were paid out as dividends to the\\r\\r\\nshareholders (see exh. â\\x80\\x98AT4(b)â\\x80\\x99 of the 1st affidavit of the IO).\\r\\r\\n[49] These documents were exhibited by the PP and would explain the\\r\\r\\nseveral payments into the bank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth\\r\\r\\nrespondents as dividends. The PP did not adduce any evidence to the\\r\\r\\ncontrary. These documents produced by PP would contradict the contention\\r\\r\\nof the PP that these payments were for the purposes of money laundering or\\r\\r\\nwere the proceeds of unlawful activities and raised doubts on the contentions\\r\\r\\nof the PP and the case of the PP against the respondents.\\r\\r\\n[50] The IO did not affirm that he is or was an accountant or an expert in\\r\\r\\naccounts or auditing or accounting or forensic accounting. The IO did not\\r\\r\\nconnect with each â\\x80\\x98cash sale-cigaretteâ\\x80\\x99 or each transaction or sale of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes, which he referred to in his affidavits, to each smuggling of\\r\\r\\ncigarettes or unlawful sales of cigarettes or which were in contravention of\\r\\r\\nthe Customs Act. The PP did not exhibit any report by any accountant or\\r\\r\\nexpert to trace or connect the entries in the ledgers or accounts with any\\r\\r\\nsmuggling of cigarettes or unlawful sales of cigarettes or that these proceeds\\r\\r\\nor payments or dividends were derived from unlawful activities or for money\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\x0c\\r\\n\\r\\n690\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCurrent Law Journal\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[2015] 1 CLJ\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nlaundering. The IO did not produce any report from the Inland Revenue or\\r\\r\\nTax Department that the respondents had evaded income tax or other taxes\\r\\r\\nwhich contravened any law. There was no report by Public Bank, Maybank,\\r\\r\\nHong Leong Bank or Bank Negara or any other banks that these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts or that the proceeds in these bank accounts involved money\\r\\r\\nlaundering.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nA\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nB\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[51] As stated above, the PP could not show on a balance of probabilities\\r\\r\\nthat duty free cigarettes were transported from Labuan or Langkawi and were\\r\\r\\ndelivered or sold in Miri or Kota Kinabalu or in other regions in Malaysia.\\r\\r\\nThe PP could not show that there were smuggling of cigarettes from Labuan\\r\\r\\ninto Miri or Kota Kinabalu in contravention of the provisions of the Customs\\r\\r\\nAct. The PP could not show that these payments for the cigarettes sold and\\r\\r\\npaid into the account of the first respondent at Labuan were proceeds from\\r\\r\\nunlawful activities. The PP could not show that these transactions or\\r\\r\\npayments into the bank accounts of the third, fourth and fifth respondents\\r\\r\\nwere proceeds from unlawful activities and not payments as dividends.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nD\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[52] It should be noted that the respondents had not been charged for any\\r\\r\\noffence nor convicted for any offence under the Customs Act. Therefore\\r\\r\\ns. 119 of the Customs Act is not applicable to reverse the burden on the\\r\\r\\nrespondents to show that they did not commit the offence or were involved\\r\\r\\nin money laundering under s. 4(1) of Act 613.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nE\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n[53] On the affidavits and documents, the PP has failed to establish on a\\r\\r\\nbalance of probabilities that the respondents were involved in money\\r\\r\\nlaundering or in unlawful activities or that the proceeds in these bank\\r\\r\\naccounts were or are the proceeds from unlawful activities or for the\\r\\r\\npurposes of money laundering. For the reasons given, the application to\\r\\r\\nforfeit these monies or sums in these 25 bank accounts is hereby dismissed.\\r\\r\\nThe freezing or seizures of these accounts are hereby set aside.
