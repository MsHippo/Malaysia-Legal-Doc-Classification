CRIMINAL PROCEDURE: Sentence - Offence of rape - Stepfather

called for condign sentence
The defendant was alleged to have committed rape by having
sexual intercourse with a Miss X, aged 13 years and 9 months
without her consent, an offence punishable under s. 376(2) of the
Penal Code. On 23 April 2003, the defendant was alleged to have
collected Miss X from school and drove her to a lonely spot in a
jungle, the girl maintaining that the defendant had lain on top of
her and she felt his penis entering and she was in pain. According



346

Current Law Journal
Supplementary Series

[2006] 5 CLJ

to Miss X, the defendant had ejaculated outside her body on a
piece of cloth used as a floor mat in the car. The girl did not
complain or report the matter for fear of defendant’s threats
against her if she did. She had even denied the incident to her
mother (PW4), who had received an anonymous telephone call
informing her that her daughter had been seen coming out of the
jungle with the defendant. Three days later, Miss X’s aunty (PW3)
had asked the girl to tell her the truth because the police had
called. Miss X felt scared and recounted the incident. A senior
inspector of police recorded an ordinary statement from the
defendant but neither the defendant nor the senior inspector
signed the declaration at the back of the statement form. The
defendant denied taking his stepdaughter into the jungle on 23
April 2003, just as he denied having sexual intercourse with her
during the period of time. He maintained that he had taken his
stepdaughter straight home from the school, and on the following
day when it was alleged that he had again picked up the girl from
school, he maintained that he was on duty and had not left the
fire station at the relevant time. The burden was on the
prosecution to prove each and every element of the charge
beyond reasonable doubt and that the burden on the defendant,
if he was to prove any facts, was the lesser burden of proof on a
balance of probabilities.

Held:
(1) The declaration was there for a specific purpose. It was
imperative that not only the recorder of the statement reads
out and explains it to the accused person but also asks him
to sign in her presence there and then, and that the recorder
and the witness affix their signatures to it as well then and
there. Merely to say that the recording officer had overlooked
to sign it, or believed or took for granted that the defendant
had signed the declaration was not an appropriate or
acceptable explanation. Such slipshod and careless manner
affects the entire statement. It was unjust and wrong in
principle to place any reliance on the statement. (paras 71, 72
& 73)
(2) Miss X’s claim that the defendant had collected her from
school on 24 April 2003 was contradicted by both the
defendant and his witness DW2, the CRO, whose duty it was
to maintain the attendance book and the day/night book

recording the movement of the staff and their whereabouts. It
appeared obvious from the two books of record maintained at
the fire station when compared with the evidence of both the
defendant and the CRO that they did not reflect the true and
actual position. The procedure was lax, not fool proof, and
was not always followed so that it could be easily manipulated
and used to suit one’s convenience as and when required. It
could not be said with any certainty that it would reflect the
correct position and whereabouts of the staff at any given
time. Those shortcomings which were clearly deliberate in
keeping an accurate and true record in the day/night book lent
credence to the evidence of PW4 that the defendant had
collected her from the police station on 24 April 2003 at
lunch time, dropped her home to cook lunch and had
proceeded to fetch Miss X from her school, and later returned
home with the girl. (para 86 & 87)
(3) Admittedly, Miss X had not made a spontaneous complaint,
nor was it a voluntary one. It was from the standpoint of a
frightened little girl who had allegedly been warned a few times
of the dire consequences if she revealed to anyone what the
defendant had done to her. The court does not think that the
circumstances in which Miss X narrated what had befallen her
could be said to adversely affect her credibility or consistency
in any way. In the circumstances of this case and scrutinizing
the evidence closely, particularly of a girl still of tender years
as against her stepfather, a fireman much bigger and stronger
than her, taken to a lonely spot in a jungle doing her
stepfather’s bidding, her conduct showing absolute obedience
and submissiveness to the defendant’s directions and not
mentioning the incident to anybody later at home out of the
fear that the defendant had instilled in her mind of the dire
consequences to her if she reported it to anyone at home,
were all clear and distinct pointers to the mental state of the
girl. Considering what had befallen her in such a situation, it
was hard if not quite impossible to take a contrary view.
(paras 88 & 89)
(4) The owner of the car BQ5095 gave evidence that she had
placed a blue green cloth in her car, and that it was in the
car on the day of the alleged incident. One Dr Syn, whose
report was admitted by the defence, detected semen on the
same piece of cloth, and according to his unchallenged



348

[2006] 5 CLJ

conclusion it matched the DNA profile of the blood specimen
of the defendant. There was no extraneous evidence which
might cast doubt on the presence of the defendant’s semen
on exh. P2 seen in the car driven by the defendant on the
day of the incident or any other evidence which conflicted
with the suggestion that the defendant was responsible for the
crime stain. The court was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
that the undisputed DNA findings placed the defendant at the
scene which was at the place identified by Miss X. This was
strong evidence corroborating the testimony of Miss X.
(paras 94 & 95)
(5) The medical evidence taken in its totality did not rule out
sexual intercourse having taken place. Both doctors who
examined the girl have extensive experience in their fields of
specialty and neither was prepared to rule out sexual
intercourse having occurred with Miss X. Both emphasized
that non-presence of the hymen and absence of any injury to
her vagina did not negative sexual intercourse having occurred.
There were quite a lot of discharges found within her vagina,
which was indicative inter alia of sexual intercourse having
occurred. This court was satisfied that the medical evidence
offered substantial corroboration to the evidence of Miss X.
(paras 100 & 101)
(6) Having considered the veracity of the witnesses in the light of
the case as a whole and for reasons given, this court accepted
the prosecution evidence, including that of Miss X, as true.
This court was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the
defendant was guilty of the offence of rape of Miss X, a girl
under 14 contrary to s. 376(2) of the Penal Code as charged
and was convicted accordingly. (para 105)
(7) The defendant, as the stepfather of the girl, breached the trust
which his conduct entailed in relation to his stepdaughter,
taking advantage also of her youth and her helplessness in a
lonely place which led to her absolute submissiveness to his
directions. Because he pleaded not guilty, he was not entitled
to the discount given usually to those who plead guilty,
thereby saving the victim the unfortunate experience of having
to give evidence in court of an intimate nature, as well as the
mental torture the girl was made to endure. This was a
serious case by any account, and deserved a condign sentence.

[1] The defendant was charged with the offence of rape in that
on 23 April 2003 between 12.45 to 1.15 in the afternoon in the
vicinity of Kampong Sungai Tanit, Temburong, did commit rape by
having sexual intercourse with a Miss X aged 13 years and 9
months without her consent, an offence punishable under
s. 376(2) of the Penal Code.
[2] Section 375 of the Penal Code defines the offence of rape
as follows:

[2006] 5 CLJ

375. A man is said to commit ‘rape’, who, except in the case
hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under
circumstances falling under any of the five following descriptions:

A

(a) against her will;
(b) without her consent;

B

(c) with her consent, when her consent has been obtained by
putting her in fear of death or of hurt;
(d) with her consent, when the man knows that he is not her
husband, and that her consent is given because she believes
that he is another man to whom she is, or believes herself
to be, lawfully married;
(e) with or without her consent when she is under 14 years of
age.

C

D

Explanation - Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual
intercourse necessary to the offence of rape.

[3]

The following facts were agreed:
1. At all material times, the defendant was Miss X’s (female,
date of birth 7th July, 1989) stepfather. The defendant is
married to Miss X’s mother.
2. On 23rd April, 2003, at about 12.45 midday, Miss X, who
was on that day aged 13 years and 9 months was pickedup from her school, Sekolah Menengah Sultan Hassan,
Bangar, Temburong, Brunei Darussalam by the defendant
who was driving motor vehicle registration No. BQ5095.

E

F

[4] The mother of Miss X is PW4. Miss X is her daughter from
a previous marriage. She is now married to the defendant who is
a fireman and they live at the firemen’s barracks, Temburong.
PW4 works as a cleaner at the Temburong Police Station.

G

[5] It is agreed that Miss X was born on 7 July 1989. She lived
with her grandmother (PW1) and her grandfather (PW2) in
Kampong Puni, Temburong. Living with them also is their other
daughter (PW3) with her husband and their four children.

H

[6] Miss X gave evidence via one-way video link. There were
TV monitors in the courtroom: one on the judge’s bench, one for
counsel and the third was at a convenient place for the defendant
to see the image of PW5 clearly on the monitor. The sound

system worked satisfactory through the TV monitors. PW5 sat in
a room adjoining the court where the trial was being conducted.
One court interpreter sat with her in that room throughout her
evidence. The door of this room was kept closed and was opened
only once when Miss X was asked to identify her assailant. A
person standing in the door of the adjoining room where PW5
was would be directly opposite the dock where the defendant was
seated facing the same door. Her evidence was taken in camera.
[7] In April 2003 PW5 was studying in Form II at the Sultan
Hassan Secondary School in Bangar. A relative drove her to
school in the mornings. Her grandmother (PW1) said that the
school is about 2 1/2 to 3 miles from her home and that her
mother (PW4) drove her to school. The school finishes at
12.30pm. Her mother would collect her from the school at
12.30pm, and take her to her grandmother’s place. According to
PW5 she would get home in six to eight minutes, depending upon
the state of the motor traffic at the time. She attended a religious
school, the Puni Primary School, in the afternoon, and was in
Primary V at the time.
[8] On 23 April 2003 Miss X waited for her mother after the
Secondary School finished at 12.30pm. At about 12.45 she saw
her stepfather instead in her mother’s car, a black Toyota
BQ5095. This fact was admitted by the defence. Miss X got into
the car. On the way she noticed that the defendant took a
different route, which led to the arabic or religious school, but not
the one that she attended. She said that the defendant proceeded
to a small road leading to Sungai Tanit, and there was no traffic
on the road. She asked where he was taking her, to which the
defendant replied, “arah datu”, without mentioning whereto. He
drove into a jungle and stopped at a small junction, where there
were trees and rocks on both sides of the road. The defendant
picked-up a blue-green cloth from the passenger side floor of the
car, and asked her to get out of the car and follow him. They
walked for about four minutes and he led her to a small path
going into the jungle. There he asked her to take off her skirt and
underwear. She did as told. She saw there was a folded
colourless cloth on the ground, which the defendant spread out,
and asked her to lie down on it. Miss X said that the defendant
then had sexual intercourse with her. Explaining the action she
said that the defendant’s penis entered her vagina, it felt hard and



352

Current Law Journal
Supplementary Series

[2006] 5 CLJ

she felt pain as it entered her vagina. She could not recall for how
long it continued. She said that after the sexual intercourse he
ejaculated on the blue-green cloth.
[9] Miss X did not say anything but her stepfather admonished
her, saying, “Don’t tell your grandmother, or she will kill you”, and
that if she told anyone, the police would arrest her. She said that
her father was scaring her and she was afraid. After he had wiped
his penis with the blue-green cloth, he asked her to dress up,
which she did. He took along the blue-green cloth but she did not
know what happened to the transparent cloth. She said that he
was scaring her and told her, “Don’t tell your aunt. Don’t tell
anybody”.
[10] The girl said that she felt sad about the incident, she was
afraid and had pain after the intercourse. She did not understand
why her stepfather had done this to her.
[11] The defendant placed the blue-green cloth like before as
floor mat in the car. On the way after he exited from the junction
the defendant reminded her, “Don’t forget. Don’t tell anybody
about what we did”.
[12] The defendant took her to her grandmother’s home. She did
not have a watch but felt that she was late getting home. She
was in a rush. She rushed in, and had a bath. Her private parts
felt painful and she saw a “bit of blood there”. Upon being asked
by the court what she meant by “a bit of blood”, she said she
meant a small quantity, and that when she took off her underwear
she noticed blood on it also. She cleaned her underwear and
walked to the religious school. She said that because she was
afraid, she did not tell anybody about what had happened.

[13] Miss X said that she had started to menstruate at the age

incident.
[14] Her mother PW4 said that on previous occasions whenever
her husband fetched her daughter from school they would get
home by 12.45pm, but on the 23rd the defendant was late
returning home by about half hour. When she remarked that he
was late the defendant is alleged to have replied that he had gone
to the station, that being a reference to his place of work. She

said that this late return home made her restless and worried. She
said it was difficult for her to explain her state of mind but she
did not feel too good. However, she took Miss X to her
grandparents’ home.
[15] The following day, 24 April, while at work at the police
station PW4 received a telephone call from an anonymous person
who told her that her husband was seen taking her daughter past
the arabic school as though they were coming out of the forest,
and the caller advised her to ask her daughter. She said that
because of this telephone call she wanted to go to the school to
ask her daughter about what she had been told but the defendant
beat her to it as he had the car. She said that he first dropped
her home as she had to cook lunch and then went to fetch her
daughter.
[16] Meantime, as usual Miss X waited for her relative to take
her to school, and at 12.30 waited for her mother to take her
home. Instead of her mother, she saw her stepfather waiting for
her. He took her to her mother at the firemen’s barracks. On the
way he said to her that when they reached home and her mother
asked why she was late getting home, where she went after class,
she should just reply that her stepfather was getting something
from his friends at Kampong Sungai Tanit.
[17] The girl said that when they reached her mother’s home in
the barracks, she did ask her that same question and Miss X
repeated what the defendant had taught her to say in reply. Her
mother seemed to believe her. After her mother and the defendant
finished their lunch her mother took her to her grandmother’s
home. On the way her mother asked her if her stepfather had
disturbed or touched her breast or anything. Upon being told that
it was not so and that it was true he had not done anything to
her, she felt relieved but PW4 said that her heart was beating
faster. PW4 explained to her that her reason for making that
enquiry of her getting home late the previous day was because
somebody had told her that Miss X had been seen coming out of
the jungle at Sungai Tanit. Again, Miss X denied going to the
jungle and said that that they had taken that route for her
stepfather to get his things at Kampong Sungai Tanit.

[18] Miss X said that after religious school on 24 April she went
to stay at a relative’s home until 26. But on 25 her auntie (PW3)
telephoned and asked where had the defendant taken her on 23
April. She gave her the same reply that she had given to her
mother. Her auntie asked her to return home, which she did. Her
grandmother had gone to visit a relative and upon her return
home she saw that Miss X was alone in her room.
[19] PW3 saw her niece in her room and asked if it was true that
she and her stepfather had gone to Sungai Tanit for his things.
She repeated that it was true. After her auntie left the room the
telephone rang and PW3 picked it up. Then she returned to Miss
X and said, “You better tell the truth. That was the police on the
telephone”. Hearing this Miss X felt scared and then told her the
truth, that Rusydi had raped her. At about the same time her
grandmother returned from Lawas and, upon being told of the
incident, PW1 asked her if it was true that Rusydi had taken her
to the jungle behind the arabic school, unfolded a cloth and had
asked her to lay down. PW1 then asked her, “What did he do?
Did he take you as a wife, did he work on you?” She explained
that she meant to ask her if he had raped her. Miss X replied
that he did not put the water in, which the defendant had
explained to her that had he done so she would get pregnant, and
that was why he had poured it on the cloth. The girl told her that
the defendant had advised her not to tell her mother or she would
chop her to death.
[20] Then her grandmother took her to the firemen’s barracks in
her car. When her mother (PW4) came out, the grandmother
asked her if she knew that Rusydi had raped her daughter, and
said, “Did you know that Rusydi take her as a wife? Aren’t you
ashamed marrying the daughter, marrying the mother?” Hearing
this PW4 asked her daughter who was still in the car to come
inside quickly as the defendant was at home and wanted to go to
Limbang. PW5 went inside and her mother asked her to speak to
the defendant and tell the truth. Before she could speak the
defendant is alleged to have said that rather than disturbing her
he would prefer to disturb the prostitutes in Limbang. He
continued to say, “You are my stepdaughter. I see you as a
daughter. Why should I disturb you, I have other relatives who I
would disturb rather than you”.

[21] Later her uncle, Abdul Nasir bin Haji Besar (PW7), rang her
from Brunei Muara and asked if it was true that her stepfather
had disturbed her, to which her answer was in the affirmative.
[22] The grandmother took the girl and her mother to the police
station. Miss X appeared as if she was afraid, her face was pale
and she was silent. PW1 made a report about this matter. That
report is one of the items that had been agreed and is to the
following extent:
On 25 April, 2003 at 1500 hours, at that time I was at home,
address No. 28, Simpang 321, Kg Puni, was informed by my
daughter (name suppressed by Court) PW3 where she said that
Miss X (F 13th) was believed to be incest by the stepfather,
named Rusydi bin OKP Harun (M 40th).

[23] Miss X was asked about it and she told the police briefly
that her stepfather had raped her and told the police where it
happened.
[24] The police asked the defendant to report at the police
station. He arrived in his wife’s car. Three or four policemen took
Miss X to her mother’s car, where she pointed out the blue-green
cloth on which, according to her testimony, the defendant had
ejaculated and she had seen semen on it on 23 April. In court
she identified the cloth in photographs P/D and P/E. PW1 said
that she used that piece of cloth as a floor mat in the car, and
had put it in the car about two months before the incident.
[25] After Miss X had given her statement and identified the
blue-green cloth, she led the police to the scene.

[26] Subsequently during the trial more facts (1 to 11) were
agreed between the parties, and reduced into writing stating the
name of the victim as well as of her close relations. In setting out
those agreed facts and throughout this judgment I have
suppressed the names mentioned in the document, and instead
given their witness number wherever I found it necessary.
Continuing the numerical order from the previously agreed two
facts, those additional agreed facts are as follows:

In the afternoon of 25th April, 2003, the victim (Miss X)
together with her mother (PW4) and her grandmother
(PW1) attended Temburong Police Station to lodge a
report attached herewith as Appendix 1.

After giving her statement to the Royal Brunei Police Force
at Temburong Police Station Miss X identified to the said
police a blue-green cloth which Miss X has identified and
has been tendered as P2. Photos marked D-E were taken
of P2 by PC4372 Joannes anak Mulok in the motor
vehicle registration No. BQ5095 Toyota Starlet which it
was found in is attached and marked herewith as Appendix

P2 was kept in police custody and a Police Exhibit Form
was duly issued, marked and annexed as Appendix 3.

Miss X was then brought by the police to the place of
incident. She was then brought to the jetty outside
Temburong Police Station and was brought to Bandar Seri
Begawan jetty via a police boat together with several
police escorts. P2 was also brought by the police escorts.

Upon arrival at the jetty in Bandar, Miss X was passed
to Police Officers from the Domestic Violence Unit

12(10) The defendant came to the Temburong Police Station
sometime in the afternoon of 25 April 2003. The defendant
was arrested and was kept in police custody overnight.
On 26 April 2003, the defendant was escorted to the jetty
outside Temburong Police Station and was brought to
Bandar Seri Begawan jetty via a Police Boat. Upon arrival
at Bandar Seri Begawan jetty, the defendant was brought
to the Domestic Violence Unit, Police Headquarters,
Gadong by Police Officers.
13(11) On 21st January, 2004, both the defendant and Miss X
gave a sample of blood at RIPAS Hospital. The sample
of blood together with the said cloth was brought for
DNA sampling at DNA profiling laboratory Centre for
Forensic Science, 11 Outram Road, Singapore by the
police. A copy of the DNA report is attached and marked
herewith as Appendix 5.

[27] The DNA report prepared and certified by Dr Christopher
KC Syn, Analyst, Singapore states that three exhibits, wax sealed
“Commissioner of Police Brunei” and marked “V.1”, “V.2”, and
“S.1”, were submitted to the Centre for Forensic Science by ASP
Masni binti Haji Jamil. The exhibits were found to be:
V.1 One piece of cloth. It was examined for the presence of
blood, but none was detected. Semen with spermatozoa was
detected on the piece of cloth. The deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) profile was obtained by amplification of DNA
extracted from the semen stain on the cloth. The results are
shown in the table below.
V.2 One blood specimen, marked (name mentioned but
suppressed by Court, the corresponding witness number
inserted instead) PW5. The DNA was obtained by
amplification of DNA extracted from the blood sample. The
results are shown in the table below.
S.1 One blood sample, marked Mohammad Rusydi bin OKP
Awang Harun. The DNA profile was obtained by
amplification of DNA extracted from the blood sample. The
results are shown in the table below.

[28] Explaining his conclusion Dr Syn stated:
I

The DNA sample of the semen on the exhibit ‘V.1’ is found to
match the DNA profile of the blood specimen marked ‘S.1’ at
genetic loci D8S1179, D21SII, D7S820, CSF1PO, D3S1358,

Amaelogenin, D5S8178, and FGA. The probability of another
person, selected at random from the Malay population, having the
same DNA profile, is estimated to be 1 in 3.2 quadrillion (3.2 x
1015).

[29] At about 5pm, on 25 April, some policemen escorted Miss
X in a boat to RIPAS Hospital. Upon arrival at the tambing jetty
Insp. Sapiah escorted her to the hospital, where a lady doctor
examined her body, including her vagina. Dr Ni Ni Aung (PW9)
of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of RIPAS
Hospital, with experience of 30 years since qualification and 16
years since fellowship and had worked at RIPAS Hospital for
more than seven years, examined Miss X at about 9pm. She did
not find any outward sign of injury. She did local examination of
her private parts, but saw no obvious injury; she looked for the
hymen but could not find it. She said that normally a girl of the
patient’s age would have the hymen but if she had an injury at a
young age she might not have it. She used a small speculum,
which she could easily manoeuvre inside the vagina but could not
find any injuries. However she found quite a lot of discharges,
which could have been normal physiological discharges, or
secretions after sexual intercourse or premenstrual discharge. She
took the routine swabs from the vagina for the presence of
spermatozoa and enzymes, and also took her blood and urine
samples to check for infection. She said that absence of injuries
did not rule out rape, keeping in mind that Miss X came to
hospital two days after the incident; the incident of rape itself may
have been gentle or if some lubricant or with a condom some
lubricant might have been used. The doctor said that Miss X
looked slightly distressed. She opined that the absence of the
hymen, the ‘plenty’ of secretions in the vagina and her slightly
distressed condition made her assume that Miss X had been raped
as alleged.
[30] Dr Ni Ni Aung handed over the smears that she had taken
to Dr Satyavani. She stressed that her line of work was
gynaecology, and her sub-specialties were family planning, which
included male and female organs and secretions, oncology, subfertility, ultrasound and pathology. She explained that present in
semen are spermatozoa, acid phosphotase and enzymes, all in high
level. Absence of any signs of these from the vagina was not
consistent with allegation of rape, for if a condom had been used
by the man there would not be any secretions nor would there

be any vaginal cells or spermatozoa on the male organ after sexual
intercourse. In a question from the Court the doctor said that the
other possibility would be that the man had wiped his male organ
after sexual intercourse. She said that there would be vaginal cells
on the male organ where ejaculation occurs during sexual
intercourse but not where ejaculation occurs outside the body of
the woman, for instance, on a piece of cloth, in which case she
was not sure whether there would be any vaginal cells on the
cloth, but she added, “May be”.
[31] The other medical evidence came from Dr Pemasiri Upali
Telesinghe (PW6), who is a Specialist Pathologist at the RIPAS
Hospital. He has been a pathologist for the past 32 years, and
has testified in court numerous times. As pathologist he is in
charge of all blood and tissue testing on hospital patients, he does
autopsies and examines male persons accused of sexual offences
and also examines smears taken from victims of sexual offences.
On 26 April 2003 he examined smears that had been taken by Dr
Ni Ni Aung from Miss X the previous day. He made a written
report Path. 457/2003/D (B) dated 30 April 2003. He examined
the smear for the presence of spermatozoa, and did tests for acid
phosphotase and for bacterial infection or gonococci. Spermatozoa
was not detected and the other two tests were also negative. He
explained that acid phosphotase is an enzyme secreted by the
prostate gland in males. He said that some people do not produce
spermatozoa due to previous illness or failure of spermatozoa
production by the testes, and there would not be any
spermatozoa in males who have had vasectomy, so that to prove
the existence of semen, the secretion from the testes was the only
way. He explained the gonococci is a sexually transmitted disease
and has the shortest incubation period. He said that if the victim
of a sexual case is presented for examination after three days of
the incident and if the test is positive for gonococci, then the
alleged assailant would have gonohorrea in the instant case the
test was negative.
[32] Dr Telesinghe said that semen has two components:
spermatozoa and acid phosphotase, ie, acid secretion. He said that
usually ejaculation contains 6-10 million ml of spermatozoa and
about 3000 units per litre of acid phosphate. The reading that he
had of the presence of acid phosphate was 5 u/1, which meant
that there was no spermatozoa in the sample. He emphasized that
this test result did not mean that sexual intercourse had not

occurred. It meant that there was no ejaculation within the
vagina. He said that acid phosphotase is an unstable enzyme and
if the lady concerned used soap to cleanse herself the alkaline
contents of the soap would destroy the acid phosphotase in the
semen.
[33] Later Miss X was taken to Taman Nurhidayah, a
Government Welfare Home Centre.
[34] Next day, 26 April, she was taken to Gadong Police Station
where she made a statement, a copy of which was given to her.
At 9am, Senior Inspector Halimah binti Nayan (PW8) of the
Domestic Violence Unit took over the investigations of this case
in Crime Report 39 of 2003, which was about a girl aged 13 who
had allegedly been raped by her stepfather. Half an hour later she
saw the girl PW5 in DSP Aminah’s office and on instructions
proceeded to take a statement from the girl, after which she sent
her to Taman Nurhidayah.
[35] The Senior Inspector said that PC4238 Aw Ku Safajaya
(PW10) brought the defendant into her office on the same day at
1515 hours. She recorded a statement from him. The defence
counsel objected to the admissibility of the statement on the
ground that he had made it involuntarily for various reasons: that
he had been remanded overnight in Bangar Police Station,
Temburong, and was given a plate of stale noodles which he did
not eat, and was not given any drink; that overnight at Bangar
Police Station police personnel had approached him on a number
of occasions and forced him to confess and as a result of those
visits he had not had proper sleep; that during those visits he was
told that he had better confess because the police at the
Headquarters at Gadong would not tolerate him if he did not
confess and would be given far worst treatment than what he had
received at Bangar; that he was allowed to wear shorts only, it
was cold during the night and he was not given any blanket or
mattress and had to use a concrete slab to sit or lie on; that the
next morning he was given just a cup of tea for breakfast; that he
was not given an option to make or not to make a statement
other than a confession; that he was not informed of the offence
for which he had been arrested and no notice was read out to
him; and lastly he was not given any food or drink when he
arrived at the Police Headquarters at Gadong, before the
statement was taken from him.

[36] I admitted the statement into evidence after holding a voir
dire. I took heed of the fact that no statement had been recorded
from him at Bangar Police Station, that whereas he had allegedly
been scared by some police officers at Bangar that he would be
hurt at the Police Headquarters if he did not admit the offence,
upon arrival at the headquarters, nothing untoward seems to have
occurred, and that there was no evidence that he had asked for
food or drink at the headquarters and was denied by the police. I
concluded:
Taking into account his complaints about the treatment at Bangar,
the evidence leaves no doubt in my mind that the circumstances
at the headquarters were totally different. In any case the alleged
complaints taken singly or cumulatively are not of such a nature
so as to render the statement in question that was made at the
Police Headquarters, inadmissible. Those complaints against the
police officers at Bangar may call for adverse criticism and may
diminish the value of their testimony, but I do not see how the
alleged conduct of the police at Bangar would impact the
statement that was made at the Police Headquarters to the Senior
Inspector soon after the defendant's arrival there. There was
sufficient interval of time in between and there is no evidence of
anything that might have been done at the Police Headquarters,
such as to occasion real and substantial prejudice to the defendant.

[37] Accordingly I ruled that the statement had been made
voluntarily and admitted it in evidence under the provisions of
s. 117(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
[38] On 28 April, the police escorted Miss X to the scene of the
incident, where they took some photographs. Later a rough sketch
was prepared. She explained photos P/A, P/B and P/C of the
scene. The blue-green cloth (exh. P2) shown in photos P/D and
P/E was identified in court by Miss X after it was taken out of a
sealed envelope.
[39] The last item of prosecution evidence relates to the occasion
when the defendant and his elder sister accompanied by Orang
Kaya Ampading and his wife called on PW2, the grandfather of
Miss X. According to PW2 who upon being asked by court gave
his age as ‘one year more than 80’, they saw him five days after
his granddaughter had gone to Pulaie, that is, she had been sent
to Taman Nurhidayah. I may repeat that she was taken to this
Welfare Home after Dr Ni Ni Aung (PW9) had finished her
examination of the girl on 25 April 2003. On this reckoning those

four persons, including the defendant, would have seen PW2 on
or about the 30th of the month. PW2 said that after he had
welcomed them, the defendant’s sister said that Rusydi had
committed a big offence, and went on to say, “We have a big
wish and we ask for sympathy, if Rusydi was to be imprisoned for
20 years, ask for reduction and if he was to be whipped 15 times,
ask for it to be reduced”. PW2 said that his reply was that there
was nothing he could do, and it was for the court to decide. He
said that he knew the offence committed was rape. According to
PW2 the defendant’s mother and his sisters came again the
following day.
[40] Learned defence counsel submitted no case to answer at the
close of the prosecution evidence. I held that a prima facie had
been made out by the prosecution and put the defendant on his
defence. Learned counsel informed the court that he had already
explained to the defendant his options under s. 221 Criminal
Procedure Code, and as such there was no need for the court to
repeat them. He said that the defendant had elected to give
evidence.
[41] The defendant (DW1) gave his age as 41. In 2003 he
worked as fireman with the Fire Service Department, Temburong,
and he was fireman ABKS100. This prefix stands for Ahli Bomba
Kelas Satu, meaning “Class Fireman Class 1”. He lived with his
wife and two children aged about 4 and 6. He said that he went
to pick-up his stepdaughter from school on 23 April 2003. The
traffic was heavy around the school compound and he arrived at
the school at about 12.30. Five minutes later she came and got
into the car. He said that it took him about 20 minutes to get
out of the school compound because there were too many cars.
He said that after leaving the school compound he drove for
about 25 minutes in very congested traffic to the firemen’s
barracks. There his stepdaughter went inside his home to the
sitting room where she met her mother, and he went in to eat.
He said that the mother and daughter were chatting and later his
wife drove her daughter in her car to her grandmother’s home,
while he stayed at home.
[42] The defendant denied taking his stepdaughter into the jungle
on 23 April 2003 between 12.45pm, and 1.15pm, just as he
denied having sexual intercourse with her during the period of
time.

[43] An officer at the fire brigade known as the CRO keeps a
record of all that happens at the fire station. On 24 April the
CRO on duty was ABKS110 Lain anak Asun (DW2). All the
particulars in the attendance book are filled by the CRO on duty.
[44] DW1 said that he was on duty on the 24th from 9am, until
1.15pm, on the 25th April, and during those duty hours he was
not allowed to go out anywhere, not even to his home, except to
answer a fire alarm.
[45] The defendant said that he did not fetch his stepdaughter
from school on 25 April 2003, and was not home in the firemen’s
barracks during the morning. He said that after finishing his duty
that day he returned home, had a bath and rested at home in the
bedroom. Suddenly his wife woke him up and asked him to go to
the living room, and when he got there she said in the presence
of his mother-in-law and his stepdaughter that he had raped his
stepdaughter. He denied the allegation and said to his wife, “No,
because I consider her like my own daughter”. His mother-in-law
also made the same accusation, adding that she would report the
matter to the biological father of PW5, who would take the
necessary action. He repeated his denial of the accusation. He
said that his mother-in-law took him to the police station. He
went in a different car.
[46] At the police station the defendant went straight into the
investigating officer's room where he was questioned. One of the
officers asked him to confess and he alleged that he was
threatened also.
[47] The defendant denied the suggestion that he had ever taken
Miss X into the jungle in the vicinity of Sungai Tanit.
[48] The defendant was shown the photographs PD and PE. He
said he did not recognize the cloth depicted in the photographs.

I

[49] At this point in evidence of the defendant, the Deputy
Public Prosecutor referred to s. 117A of the Criminal Procedure
Code (Cap. 7) and submitted that the defendant could not
without leave of the court adduce evidence in support of an alibi
unless “before the end of the prescribed period, he gives notice
of particulars of the alibi”. I pointed out that the defence seemed
to be a complete denial of the charge and that I did not think
that the defendant was relying on any alibi. Learned defence
counsel confirmed that the defence was not one of alibi. The
prosecution did no pursue this matter any further.

[50] The defendant was shown exh. P5, the statement that he
had made to the police. He agreed making all the answers
recorded in the statement except the long answer to the 5th
question, which concerned his whereabouts on 23 April 2003. His
answer was:
In the morning I was at Kampong Kinua, Jalan Temada
Temburong together with my first wife and at about 0900 hours,
I was drinking whisky about half a bottle mixed with ice to be a
medicine to my body, if I do not drink, my body is weak and
shaky. At about 1150 hours I went to Sekolah Menengah Sultan
Hassan Bangar to take my stepdaughter named (the name has
been suppressed by Court) PW5 after mutual consent from my
second wife. When I arrived at the school at about 1245 hours,
we then went straight to one jungle area where I do not really
remember. When we arrived there, I then stopped my car and my
stepdaughter went out and I followed her from behind. Not far
from the said place my stepdaughter then stopped and I was also
bewildered. At the time, she brought a piece of coloured cloth
which I was not sure either blue or green which she had taken
from the front passenger seat foot place, which she laid out ontop
of the ground scattered with. Then I asked her, what is this? At
that time she did not answer and she just smiled. Then she took
off her long skirt and her underwear and held my hand, I then
opened my trousers and had intercourse with her and at the time
of intercourse, I came to realise and was scared and then I stood
up and ejaculated on the cloth. After that I then brought her back
to the house of her grandmother in Kampong Puni and then I
went back to my barracks and went straight to sleep.

[51] The defendant said that he did not give this answer, this
because he did not agree with this paragraph. He said that the
instruction he received about signing this statement was,
“Wherever you agree you sign and wherever you disagree you
need not sign”. He did not sign at the end of the above
paragraph because he did not agree to it.
[52] With regard to the declaration on the reverse side of the
first page which does not bear his signature the defendant
explained that he did not sign it because “what is found in the
declaration as to what I had done on 23 April is not the same”
as his evidence in court the previous day. His counsel asked him,
“Did you ever tell the police the same as you told the court
yesterday? A. No, because I was disturbed mentally”.

[53] He said that he was not questioned before he made his
statement, exh. P5, nor in Temburong. He denied seeing the bluegreen cloth which was shown to him by his counsel and replied
that he had never seen it before.
[54] The defendant agreed that he had given his blood sample at
RIPAS Hospital willingly in the course of police investigation into
this case but he was never told the purpose for which it was
required. He said he did not harbour any fear when he gave his
blood sample.
[55] The defence called CRO KS110 Lian anak Asun (DW2) of
the Fire Service Department, Temburong. He has a service record
of 17 years or so with this department. Amongst his duties as
CRO is to record the movement of the staff coming into and
going out of, the fire station in the day/night book, exh. D2 and
D2A. He said in 2003 the staff at Bangar fire station totalled 30,
and were divided into three groups: A, B and C, with him being
the CRO of the three groups. Each group had work shift duty of
24 hours, so that at any given time only one group would be on
duty while the other two were resting. The group on shift had to
stay on duty 24 hours, and they contributed for buying food
which they cooked at the fire station. They could sleep at the
station while on stand by duty.

G

[56] The other record that is kept is of the individual duties of
members of the group. This is the attendance book, exh. D1 and
D1A. According to this record he himself was on duty on 24 April
2003. In the group on duty ‘B’ sheet that day was ABKS100
who was the driver of the Fire Brigade Vehicle ET/1. Group B
started duty at 9am, that day and were to come off at 9am, on
the following day, the 25th.

H

[57] DW2 said that any member of the group on duty desirous
of leaving the station for whatever purpose had to obtain
permission to leave and it would be recorded in the day/night
book, but not in the attendance book.

F

I

[58] He said that there was no entry in the day/night book
record for 24 April 2003 of the defendant leaving the station
during duty hours. He said that as the duty CRO he sounded the
bell at 1215, signifying the mid-day break for Group B for their
lunch and rest. He said that at that time the defendant was at
the station and had his lunch there too.

[59] The record for the following day, 25 April showed that the
defendant who was one of the five on duty went out to Bukok
Primary School on a cleaning campaign, headed by ABK62. They
are recorded as having left at 0727 but he did not know when
they returned as he had knocked off duty at 9am.
[60] The Indian counterpart to our law is s. 375 of the Penal
Code. The only discernible difference is that it has six descriptions
of the offence, rather than five as in the local legislation. Missing
from our law is the fifth Indian constituent; otherwise the
remaining five descriptions are the same. The Indian sixth clause
and our cl. (e) are in pari material, in that they deal with the same
subject matter. In the Law of Crimes by Ratanlal & Dhirajlal, 24th
edn., the learned editors in their commentary on this section say
at p. 1789:
If the girl is less than 16 years of age, for 16 substitute 14, “her
consent is immaterial. A girl who is below 16 years of age if
taken forcibly by the accused persons to another city and kept
there for a long period, even if she had consented to accompany
them it would not amount to the exercise of discretion. If once it
was proved that the girl was below 16 years of age, the question
of consent did not arise and the fact that no injury was detected
on the private parts of the girl or that she was found to have
been used to sexual intercourse also become irrelevant. Even if
the girl who is 14 years of age, is not ‘modest’ and is a willing
party or even if she invited the accused to have sexual intercourse
with her, the act would still be an offence under this section.

[61] It is clear therefore that it is the age of the victim minor girl
that is the deciding factor, consent or the absence of it being
irrelevant. I do not think that it could be said of this penal
provision that it is capable of two interpretations and the
interpretation which is most favourable to the defendant, must be
applied. That this section of the law is one of strict liability
regarding the age ingredient of the offence is clear, and one could
trace its origin to Reg. v. Prince [1875] LR 2 CCR 154. Whereas
doubts have been expressed elsewhere as to the whether the
strict liability regarding the age ingredient would further the
purpose of the penal provision, the principle enunciated in that
ancient case had remained unaltered until only recent years in
some countries there has been some change keeping in conformity
with their own peculiar social and moral attitudes which may not

universally be the same, see for example B. (A Minor) v. DPP
(HL) [2000] 2 AC 428; R v. K [2002] 1 AC 462, HL. But the
old penal provision is still to be seen in the Penal Codes of some
other countries in this region besides Brunei Darussalam, to name
but a few Malaysia, Singapore and India.
[62] It follows that where the prosecution establishes the girl’s
age being below 14 years at the time of the occurrence of the
sexual intercourse, a defence that the defendant believed on
reasonable ground that she was over 14 years of age would be to
no avail and the defendant would be guilty of the offence contrary
to this section and be punishable for the rape irrespective of any
such belief on the part of the defendant.
[63] In this case there is no contestation as to the age of the
girl. It was agreed by the defence that the date of birth of Miss
X was 7 July 1989. She was thus 13 years and 7 1/2 months of
age at the time of the alleged offence, and as such it would fall
under s. 375(e) of the Penal Code. It was also agreed that the
defendant is the stepfather of Miss X.
[64] The other ingredient that has to be proved by the
prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt is that the defendant
had sexual intercourse with Miss X on the day in question.
According to the explanation appended to s. 375, penetration is
sufficient to constitute sexual intercourse necessary to the offence
of rape. In the Law of Crimes (supra) the authors comment in para
18 at p. 1790:
To constitute penetration it must be proved that some part of the
virile member of the accused was within the labia of the
pudendum of the woman, no matter how little. The only thing to
be ascertained is whether the private parts of the accused did
enter into the person of the woman. It is not necessary to decide
how far they entered. It is not essential that the hymen should
be ruptured, provided it is clearly proved that there was
penetration even though partial. For the offence of rape to be
committed, it is not necessary that there should be complete
penetration ... in Reg v. Ferroll Green, J, directed the jury that
vulval penetration only was sufficient, under the law of India, to
constitute rape without actual seminal emission.

[65] There the victim was aged six, she had not complained nor
was there any injury to her private parts. She was found to be
suffering from gonorrhoea, so was the accused. It was clear that



368

[2006] 5 CLJ

the penetration, if any, had been only vulval. Green J, directed the
jury that this was sufficient to constitute rape, and the accused
was convicted of rape.
[66] Learned defence counsel rightly submitted that the burden
on the prosecution is to prove each and every element of the
charge beyond reasonable doubt, and that the burden on the
defendant, if he has to prove any facts, is the lesser burden of
proof on a balance of probabilities.
[67] As has been mentioned earlier I ruled the statement made
by the defendant to the police in the course of investigations to
PW8 admissible, despite some objections from the defence. If what
is stated therein is accepted, the statement would not only conflict
with the defence upon which he relied during trial but may add
further to the strength of the prosecution case. The Senior
Inspector recorded it on Police Form 22 after she had read over
to him the declaration at the back of the first page. The defendant
is alleged to have said that he understood the declaration and
agreed to give a statement in the form of question and answer.
After it had been recorded PW8 asked the defendant to go
through it, make such amendments as he wanted. The Senior
Inspector said that he did not have any amendments to make and
she read out the printed declaration at the back of p. 1 and then
he signed the statement, and so did the Senior Inspector.
[68] In order to appreciate the importance of this declaration it
is reproduced hereunder:
I, (name) declare that this statement (consisting of ... pages, each
signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and
I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I may be
liable to prosecution if I have willfully stated in it anything which
I know to be false or do not believe to be true, and shall be
signed by the maker, the recording officer and the interpreter.

[69] This declaration, which is in two languages – Malay and
English, – requires the maker to indicate in the dotted space the
number of pages of the statement, and at the end of the
declaration requires the signatures of the person making the
declaration, the recording officer and the interpreter. The original
Malay version of this declaration has not been completed and of
the three persons required to affix their signatures thereto, there
appears only the signature of the recording officer who also filled

in the defendant’s name and the number of pages. The name of
the maker is missing from the English version, so too the number
of pages; the maker of the declaration has not signed it nor has
the recording officer, the only signature at the bottom is that of
the witness, PC4256 (PW3). What he was witnessing remains a
mystery to me.
[70] During cross-examination it was put to the recording officer
that the declaration at the back of p. 1 which she claimed to have
read out to the defendant and which the defendant said he
understood, did not bear his signature notwithstanding that he had
been specifically asked to sign at the end of the declaration. The
Senior Inspector said that she did not ensure that the defendant
had signed at the end of the declaration. When re-examined by
the Deputy Public Prosecutor, the Senior Inspector explained that
she had seen the defendant put his signature against every answer,
so had believed that he had signed the declaration also.
[71] The declaration is there for a specific purpose and it is
imperative that not only the recorder of the statement reads out
and explains it to the accused person but also asks him to sign it
in her presence there and then, and that the recorder and the
witness affix their signatures to it as well then and there. Where
the maker of the statement refuses to sign the declaration in all
respects, the fact of his refusal ought to be recorded. Whereas all
the other answers made by the defendant bear his signature at the
end of each answer save the 5th, the space for his signature at
the end of the declaration is conspicuous by the absence of his
signature. In this situation the defendant’s explanation that in not
signing at that particular place was in compliance with what he
had been told by the recording officer, that is, he was to sign only
if he agreed with his answer as recorded, seems to me quite
reasonable. Explaining the reason why he did not sign at the end
of that particular answer to question 5 he said that it was because
he did not admit what had been recorded.
[72] I must emphasise that such slipshod and careless manner of
recording such a statement may, as in this case, affect the entire
statement. As is apparent from the wording of the declaration the
signature is to the truth of what is stated in each page of the
statement, so that the absence of the signatures of the three
rather going to the truth of what is stated on each page, in my
opinion effectively goes to negate it irrespective of the answers that



370

Current Law Journal
Supplementary Series

[2006] 5 CLJ

do bear the defendant's signature. The lone signature of the
witness at the bottom of the declaration is of no avail in such
circumstances and does not and cannot supply that which is
missing that the declaration requires. To merely say that the
recording officer believed or took for granted that the defendant
had signed the declaration and that she had overlooked to put her
signature to it is not an appropriate or acceptable explanation for
those omissions.
[73] In the circumstances I am led to the conclusion that it
would be unjust and wrong in principle to place any reliance on
the statement, PP5, and I am ignoring it completely.
[74] Learned defence counsel’s next argument is the credibility
issue, referring to the credibility of Miss X who had claimed that
the defendant had collected her from school on 24 April 2003,
which it is submitted is contradicted by both the defendant and
his witness DW2, the CRO at the time, based on the fire station's
attendance book and the day/night book. It is submitted that
contrary to the claim made by Miss X that her stepfather had
collected her from the school on 24 April 2003 the two record
books of the fire station supported the defendant’s contention that
he did not go to the school to fetch Miss X home. It is also
maintained that the defendant could not have left the fire station
during lunch break that day because the only way out was
through the office of the CRO, who testified that he did not see
any of the staff pass through his office on the way out.
[75] The attendance book (exh. D1A) shows that the defendant
ABKS100 was on duty as driver of the Fire Brigade Vehicle ET/
1 from 0900 hours on 24th April until 0900 on the next day. The
excerpt from the day/night book (exh. D2A) for 24 April 2003
shows that the defendant was on duty in Group B that day as
driver of ET/1 from 9am, on the 24th to 9am, on 25 April. DW2
said that any member of the various groups on duty wanting to
leave the station for whatever purpose would have to get
permission from the fireman and then it would be recorded in the
day/night book only. He said that the record for 24 April 2003
did not have any entry to show that the defendant left the station
during duty hours. He testified that as CRO that day he sounded
the bell at 1215 hours for the midday break for Group B and
members of this group including the defendant rested at the fire
station and had their lunch there.

[76] Under cross-examination the CRO (DW2) admitted as
recorded in exh. D2A that he left the station at 9am, to see a
doctor. He said that he returned before 10am. He agreed that his
return is not recorded in exh. D2A. He explained the reason for
the non-recording of his return to the station was that he had not
gone out for a long time. He disagreed with the suggestion that
anyone could leave the station without being recorded in the
book.
[77] The CRO’s attention was next drawn to the entry in exh.
D2A for 0906 hours, recording the departure from the station of
vehicle ET/1 driven by fireman driver (FD) 100, that being the
defendant, for a test drive to Bangar Camp. Again, he agreed that
there is no record of when this vehicle returned, the reason he
gave was that Bangar Camp is not far from the fire station.
[78] The CRO explained further under cross-examination that his
temporary replacement CRO during his absence from his office
would jot down the happenings during the absence on a piece of
paper, which he (DW2) would transfer into the day/night book on
his return. He said that his replacement, who was there in his
place at the time, forgot to write down the time people including
the defendant returned from Bangar Camp.
[79] DW2 said that on the 24th he went for lunch at 1216
hours, after his replacement had had his lunch, and returned after
5 minutes. He agreed that he was not with the defendant the
whole time when he was away for lunch because DW2 had to
return to his duty, but he disagreed with the suggestion that the
defendant had left the premises of the fire station sometime during
lunch time without his knowledge. He did not agree when it was
put to him that the defendant did not have lunch at the fire
station that day, but he agreed that he was not side by side with
the defendant between 11.30am, and 1.30pm, that day. He said
that none of them are allowed to leave the fire station to pick-up
their children from school.

H

I

[80] When re-examined DW2 maintained that he saw the
defendant at the station when he returned from the hospital
having his lunch at the station and had not seen him leave the
station after lunch. He said that it was not possible for him to
have left without DW2 noticing him, while agreeing that there are
entrances and exits which are closed during day-time and the
firemen on duty had to pass through the CRO’s room to go out
of the fire station.

[81] Based on this evidence learned counsel for the defendant
submitted that the claim of the defendant’s wife (PW4) that her
husband had collected Miss X from her school on 24 April had
been “proved to be a lie”. Counsel relied on Public Prosecutor v.
Amir bin Mohammad & Others [1996] 5 MLJ 159, 165 where
Abdul Malik Ishak J, quoted from the judgment of Syed Othman,
J, in Tua Kin Ling v. Public Prosecutor [1970] 2 MLJ 61, 63 this
passage:
No doubt the rule is that if a witness had lied on one or two
points it does not necessarily follow that his whole evidence
should be rejected. (Khoon Chye Hin v. Public Prosecutor [1961]
MLJ 105). But it is the duty of the Court to sieve the evidence
and to ascertain what are the parts of the evidence tending to
incriminate the accused which could be accepted.

[82] Reliance is also sought from Junit v. Public Prosecutor [1994]
JCBD 347, 352 where Roberts CJ, said:
It is well established, by other cases, that it is proper for a Court
to believe part of the evidence of a witness and refuse to accept
the rest. In this instance, however, reliability of the story told by
Kathrina as to the assault on her is central to the charge. If there
is any real doubt as to that, it cannot be said that the prosecution
has proved its case to that degree which is required, namely
beyond reasonable doubt.

[83] Learned defence counsel submitted that the evidence of Miss
X is “central” to the charge, “if the court find real doubt to her
credibility as a whole, it would be unsafe to convict D based on
the testimony of her alone”.
[84] These cases repeat well-established principles of evidence,
but what matters most is for the court to “sieve” the whole
evidence carefully to reach its conclusion. It will be recalled that
the defendant’s wife, PW4, said in her testimony that having
received the anonymous telephone call on 24 April, she
telephoned the defendant at the Fire Service Department and
asked why he had gone behind the arabic school, passing through
the forest. According to her account the defendant asked her who
had told her what she said, that it was libel and that he had gone
to see a friend to collect a debt. She then warned her husband,
“Don’t do something like the other man, or other person, with a
granddaughter”. Then he asked her who was going to fetch Miss

X. PW4 said that she had wanted to go to fetch her but the
defendant had the car, and he first picked her up from the police
station at about 12.30pm, dropped her at home as she had to
cook lunch, and proceeded to fetch Miss X from the school. She
denied the defence suggestion that she had fetched her daughter
from the school on 24 April.
[85] As against this evidence of the defendant’s wife as well as
that of Miss X about the identity of the person who went to
collect her from the school on 25 April and she said it was her
stepfather, is the evidence of the defendant and the CRO to the
effect that the defendant did not leave the fire station and had
his lunch there. I have already commented on the unsatisfactory
manner in which the two records are kept at the fire station.
[86] It appears quite obvious from the two books of record
maintained at the fire station when compared with the evidence
of both the defendant and the CRO that they do not reflect the
true and actual position. It strikes me that the procedure is lax, is
not fool proof, and is not always followed so that it can easily be
manipulated and used to suit one's convenience as and when
required. In the circumstances it cannot be said with any certainty
that it would reflect the correct position and whereabouts of the
staff at any given time. The evidence indicates that the CRO,
rather than setting an example to his firemen, was not averse from
taking liberties with that record book by not correctly recording
his return to his office. If that sort of conduct bordering on
truancy happened once, the likelihood of it occurring at other
times cannot be discounted. To wave it aside on the basis that
the distance was short or that the officer had gone out for a short
while only do not appeal to me as credible explanation.
[87] Those shortcomings which were clearly deliberate in keeping
an accurate and true record in the day/night book lend credence
to the evidence of the defendant's wife, PW4, that the defendant
collected her from the police station on 24 April at lunch time,
dropped her home to cook lunch and proceeded to fetch Miss X
from her school, and later returned home with the girl. He was
still at home when the grandmother came with Miss X.
[88] The subject of a recent complaint having been made by the
girl was not canvassed in this trial. Such a complaint has been
held to be admissible not as being evidence of the facts



374

Current Law Journal
Supplementary Series

[2006] 5 CLJ

complained of but as evidence of the consistency of the conduct
of the victim with the story told by her in the witness box. There
is authority if I mistake not that such a complaint need not be on
the earliest opportunity and a complaint made a week after the
event has been admitted. In this case there was a gap of some
three days before she narrated what had happened. It will be
recalled that it was her auntie, PW3, who received the anonymous
telephone call and she asked Miss X on 25 April to return home
from her friend’s home. Until then the girl had stuck to what her
stepfather had taught her. But it was only when PW3 told her
on her return that the telephone that she had attended to just at
that time was from the police, and she had better tell the truth
did the girl tell her what had happened. Admittedly it was not a
spontaneous complaint nor could it be described as being strictly
a voluntary one. I look at it from the standpoint of a frightened
little girl who had allegedly been warned a few times of the dire
consequences if she revealed to her grandmother or to anybody
else what he had done to her. I recall her comment after the
defendant had finished with her that he was scaring her. I am not
at all surprised considering her age that she should have been in
a state of utter fright and had, in compliance with his indirect
threats, kept quiet about the incident on reaching home or when
taxed by her auntie. In her circumstances, notwithstanding that it
was the mention of the police that she revealed for the first time
what had happened to her, I do not think that the circumstances
in which Miss X narrated what had befallen her on 23 April could
be said to adversely affect her credibility or consistency in any
way.
[89] In the circumstances of this case and scrutinizing the
evidence closely, particularly of a girl still of tender years as against
her stepfather, a fireman, much bigger and stronger than her,
taken to a lonely spot in a jungle doing her stepfather’s bidding,
her conduct showing absolute obedience and submissiveness to the
defendant’s directions and not mentioning the incident to anybody
later at home out of the fear that the defendant had instilled in
her mind of the dire consequences to her if she reported it to
anyone at home, are all clear and distinct pointers to the mental
state of the girl. Considering what had befallen her in such a
situation I find it hard if not quite impossible to take a contrary
view.

[90] Notwithstanding that the issue of consent does not arise in
this prosecution, I think that it still remains for the court to
consider whether there is corroboration for the victim’s evidence.
[91] There is first of all DNA profile evidence contained in the
report of Dr Christopher KC Syn, analyst of the DNA Profiling
Laboratory Centre for Forensic Science, Singapore, concerning the
semen that was detected on the blue-green piece of cloth (exh.
P2) which, as stated earlier, matched the DNA profile of the
blood sample of the defendant.
[92] Recalling the evidence of PW4, the owner of the car bearing
the registration No. BQ5095, who testified that she had placed
the blue-green cloth (exh. P2) in her car as mat two months
before this incident, and the evidence of Miss X who not only
saw it in the car on the day of the incident but saw it in the
hands of the defendant after the alleged sexual intercourse with
semen on it and which, it was agreed by the defence (para 4(2)
of agreed facts), was still in the car at the time and she pointed it
out to some policemen.
[93] The defence is a complete denial of the prosecution case, in
other words, of the allegation made against him by Miss X.
[94] I have no doubt at all on the basis of the evidence of the
owner of the car BQ5095 that she had placed the blue-green
cloth in her car, and that it was in the car on the day of the
alleged incident. Dr Syn, whose report was admitted by the
defence, detected semen on the same piece of cloth, and
according to his unchallenged conclusion it matched the DNA
profile of the blood specimen of the defendant. The defendant did
not request for the forensic science service to make available to a
defence expert the databases upon which Dr Syn’s calculations
were based. I bear in mind the conclusion of the doctor that “the
probability of another person, selected at random from the Malay
population, having the same DNA profile, is estimated to be 1 in
3.2 quadrillion (3.2 x 1015)”. I find no extraneous evidence which
might cast doubt on the presence of the defendant’s semen on
exh. P2 seen in the car driven by the defendant on the day of
the incident or any other evidence, which conflicted with the
suggestion that the defendant was responsible for the crime stain.

[95] I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the undisputed
DNA findings put the defendant at the scene which, I am just as
satisfied on the evidence, was at the place identified by Miss X
and depicted in photographs PB and PC. To my mind this is
strong evidence corroborating the testimony of Miss X.
[96] Learned counsel for the defence submitted that, because the
evidence of Miss X was “questionable” as also was the evidence
of her mother, PW4, to the effect that the defendant had pickedup Miss X from her school on 24 April 2003, had been “proved
to be a lie”. This rather circuitous argument seems to be that, on
the evidence of the CRO (DW2), the only way out for firemen
was through his office and he had not seen the defendant passing
through during the lunch break. I have dealt with that evidence
already but, at the expense of repetition, will only repeat that the
record books, particularly the system in vogue at the time of
keeping day/night book for recording in it every movement of the
staff, that is, exit and return of any on-duty firemen, having been
shown by the evidence of the CRO to be unsatisfactory and
unreliable, there was nothing to cast any doubt or suspicion upon
the credentials of PW4 being an honest, truthful and reliable
witness, as I found her to be in all respects.
[97] It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the medical
evidence “cannot establish that there had been penetration into
PW5’s vagina”.
[98] Miss X gave a graphic account of how her stepfather had
sexual intercourse with her. She felt something hard entering her
vagina. She described the position of the man on top of her and
his body moving up and down. And when she saw him holding
the crumpled blue-green cloth she was able to see some semen on
it. As seen already, Dr Syn detected semen with spermatozoa on
the piece of cloth, which is exh. P2.
[99] In the absence of any other acceptable evidence explaining
how the defendant’s semen found its way on to exh. P2, I find
that this evidence is corroborative of the evidence given by Miss
X.
[100] The medical evidence taken in its totality does not rule out
sexual intercourse having taken place. Both doctors who
examined the girl have extensive experience in their fields of
specialty and neither was prepared to rule out sexual intercourse

having occurred with Miss X. Both emphasized that non-presence
of the hymen and absence of any injury to her vagina did not
negative sexual intercourse having occurred. Dr Ni Ni Aung found
quite a lot of discharges within her vagina, which is indicative inter
alia of sexual intercourse having occurred. This doctor also found
the girl slightly distressed, another indication that entered into her
consideration for forming the view that she did.
[101] A colleague of Dr Aung, Dr Telesinghe said that there would
be tears in the hymen as well as some contusion in the vulva and
along the vagina in a victim having sexual intercourse for the first
time. In considering this evidence I am not loosing sight of the
fact that the medical examination of the girl took place after two
days of the incident and it was because of this lapse of time that
the doctors were categorical in saying that the absence of the
hymen or contusion to the vagina, if any, did not negative sexual
intercourse.
[102] Having consideration the whole body of evidence I am
satisfied that the medical evidence offers substantial corroboration
to the evidence of Miss X.
[103] Proceeding further and not to be forgotten is the evidence
of the 81 year old grandfather of Miss X (PW2). He agreed that
he personally did not know of this incident and had been told of
it granddaughter had gone to stay in Pulaie. He identified them as
Orang Kaya Ampading, his wife, the defendant and his elder sister.
He remembered what the defendant’s sister said to him in the
defendant’s presence about their “big wish”, telling him that the
defendant had committed a “big offence” and asking for sympathy
on her brother’s behalf. This visit and/or the purpose of the visit
as was stated by PW2 was not challenged in any way. Despite
his advanced age and the fact that he is the girl's grandfather I
am satisfied that there is nothing to cast any doubt or suspicion
about the evidence of PW2 and I accept him as a witness of
truth. I take this evidence as corroborative of the testimony of
Miss X.
[104] The last matter which I think I ought to mention before I
take leave of this case concerns certain questions that were put
to Miss X during cross-examination, for instance, whether she had
the “obligatory” bath which she as a Muslim had to have after
sexual intercourse. I did not intervene at the time as the witness

forgot that he was conducting defence of an accused in a criminal
case in a court which lacks jurisdiction over such religious
principles as the Hadath bath. It is clear to me that this question
was put to Miss X for some specific reason, whatever it may have
been is beside the point. Without the proper jurisdiction this court
is unable to comment upon the consequences, if any, of not
complying with that edict. I mention this now so that this sort of
conduct of springing such questions on a witness as young as
Miss X, which could possibly unnerve or upset the witness, is not
adopted as a tool of cross-examination. But Miss X was not fazed
or perplexed, nor did she show any sign of discomfiture when this
question was put to her.
[105] In the result, having considered the veracity of the witnesses
in the light of the case as a whole and for the reasons I have
given, I accept the prosecution evidence, including that of Miss
X, as true. I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the
defendant is guilty of the offence of rape of Miss X, a girl under
14 contrary to s. 376(2) of the Penal Code as charged, and he is
convicted accordingly.

[106] The defendant stands convicted of raping his stepdaughter,
Miss X, aged 13 years 9 months on 23 April 2003, contrary to
s. 376(2) of the Penal Code.
[107] On the day in question, he picked-up the victim from her
school to take her home, but took a different route from the
usual taken by her mother, whenever she collected her from
school.
[108] When the girl asked him where he was taking her to, he
merely said, “arah datu”.
[109] This was, as the evidence disclosed, a deliberate trick and
he took her to a lonely spot in a jungle, where the offence was
committed.

[111] In R v. Millbery & Others [2003] 2 Cr. App. R (S) 142
(CA), Lord Woolf CJ, quoted from the Sentencing Advisory Panel
(the “Panel”) which had forwarded to the court advice proposing
a revision of the current sentencing practice for offences of rape.

[112] While keeping in mind that there are considerable differences
in social, communal as well as religious differences between
communities living so far apart, some of the underlying sentencing
principles can and are invariably used in our courts, if for no other
reasons than for the sentencing principles which more often than
not are relied upon and applied.
[113] In the case cited, some of the panel’s suggested
recommendation are quoted at p. 146:

... there are, broadly, three dimensions to consider in assessing
the gravity of an individual offence of rape. The first is the degree
of harm to the victim; the second is the level of culpability of the
offender; and the third is the level of risk proposed by the
offender to society. We consider that Courts should consider each
of these dimensions whenever a sentence for rape is imposed.
We endorse what was stated by Lord Lane in Billam, and
repeated by the Panel in its advice, that while rape will always be
a most serious offence, its gravity will depend very much upon
the circumstances of the particular case as a whole taking into
account the three dimensions to which we have already referred.
I keep those three dimensions in mind.

[114] The defendant, as the stepfather of the girl, breached the
trust which his conduct entailed in relation to his stepdaughter,
taking advantage also of her youth and her helplessness in a lonely
place which led to her absolute submissiveness to his directions.
[115] Because he pleaded not guilty, he is not entitled to the
discount given usually to those who plead guilty, thereby saving
the victim the unfortunate experience of having to give evidence
in court of an intimate nature, as well as the mental torture the
girl was made to endure.
[116] I am of the opinion that this is a serious case by any
account, and deserves a condign sentence.

[117] In the recent case of Public Prosecutor v. A.I, High Court
Criminal Trial No. 7 of 2003 (unreported), where the defendant
pleaded guilty to two counts of rape contrary to s. 376(1) of the
Penal Code, which involved rape of the defendant’s eldest
daughter aged 15, Chong J, imposed a sentence of 15 years’
imprisonment with 15 strokes on each charge, the prison terms
were made concurrent and the strokes non-cumulative. Those
were sentences upon a plea of guilty.

[118] In this case the girl was made to suffer the additional mental
torture and anguish of having to recall and live through the
incident all over again. I consider this as a far more serious factor.

[119] Men who consider such girls still of tender years, be they
their own daughters or others not related but of the same age
group, as soft targets for the gratification of their base and evil
intentions, must expect no mercy from these courts.

B

[120] In all the circumstances, I consider a sentence of 15 years’
imprisonment and 15 strokes folly merited in this case. That is the
sentences I impose on the defendant, to commence from the date
of his remand in custody.
