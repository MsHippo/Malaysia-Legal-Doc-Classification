This was the appellant’s appeal against the decision of the High Court
allowing the respondent’s application, by way of originating summons, for
the following declaratory orders (i) the ‘Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera
4/2009’ (‘the Army Guideline’) which laid down the procedure for testing
drug abuse in urine was null and void as it did not conform to the Surat

court-martial for breaching the Armed Forces Standing Order, which was an
offence under s. 51 of the Armed Forces Act 1972 (‘AFA’). The breach was
for being involved in drug abuse. The dispute that arose was over how many
bottles of urine sample was required to be taken for the purposes of a urine
test. Under the Army Guideline, only one bottle was required whereas,
under the KKM Guideline, two bottles were required. In the case of the
respondent, only one bottle of his urine sample was taken, which tested
positive for the drugs methamphetamine and amphetamine. The question
that arose was whether the procedure to be followed was the KKM Guideline
or the Army Guideline. The appellant also raised the issue that the
respondent’s application for declaratory reliefs was premature as his case
before the court-martial was ongoing.
Held (allowing appeal; setting aside decision of High Court)
Per Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA delivering the judgment of the court:

D

E

F

G

H

I

(1) The Army Guideline was made under s. 15 of the AFA read together
with art. 137 of the FC. The Army Guideline was signed by the
Secretary of the Armed Forces Council as ‘Dengan Perintah Majlis
Angkatan Tentera.’ The Army Guideline is a guideline that was issued
pursuant to a power given by law. Thus, by virtue of s. 15 of the AFA,
the Armed Forces Council is empowered by law to make regulations it
may think necessary or expedient for the better carrying into effect of
the AFA, and this includes issuing the Army Guideline. Being made
authority of the Armed Forces Council, the Army Guideline was
therefore valid and enforceable. (paras 26-29)
(2) The KKM Guideline did not have the force of law. Unlike the Army
Guideline, it was not made under any written law. The KKM Guideline
was merely a guideline issued by the Ministry of Health through a
circular and signed by the Director General of the Ministry of Health.
The purpose of the KKM Guideline is to coordinate and update the
procedure for the taking of urine samples in suspected drug abuse cases
and as a guideline to the relevant agencies, including the armed forces.
It was not meant to be a legal document having the force of law. For any
guideline to have any force of law, it must be made pursuant to a power
given by law. This was not the case with the KKM Guideline.
(paras 30-33)
(3) Since the procedure adopted by the appellant in taking only one bottle
of the respondent’s urine specimen for his urine test was in accordance
with the Army Guideline, the question that the appellant had breached
the KKM Guideline by not taking two bottles of his urine sample, did
not arise. In any event, even if the KKM Guideline had the force of law,



774

Current Law Journal

[2019] 2 CLJ

it could not supersede the Army Guideline. The Army Guideline is a
specific guideline which is meant to be enforced by the armed forces
only and by no others and it was enforceable against all members of the
armed forces without any exception. (paras 34 & 35)
(4) The court-martial must be allowed to complete its hearing, and if the
respondent was dissatisfied with the decision at the conclusion of the
proceedings, his remedy was to apply for a review under s. 128 of the
AFA. By filing the originating summons in the midst of the courtmartial, the respondent was clearly abusing the process. This must not
be countenanced by this court. (para 37)

Ini adalah rayuan perayu terhadap keputusan Mahkamah Tinggi yang
membenarkan permohonan responden, melalui saman pemula, untuk
perintah-perintah pengisytiharan (i) Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera 4/
2009 (‘Garis Panduan Tentera’) yang menggariskan prosedur untuk menguji
penyalahgunaan dadah dalam air kencing adalah terbatal dan tidak sah kerana
tidak mematuhi Surat Pekeliling Ketua Pengarah Kesihatan Malaysia,
Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia dan Garis Panduan Bahagian Kesihatan
Perkembangan Perubatan Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia Bilangan 6/2002
(‘Garis Panduan KKM’) dan (ii) Garis Panduan Tentera adalah terbatal dan
tidak sah kerana melanggar per. 5(1) dan 8(1) Perlembagaan Persekutuan
(‘PP’). Responden dituduh di mahkamah tentera kerana melanggar Perintah
Tetap Angkatan Tentera, satu kesalahan bawah s. 51 Akta Angkatan Tentera
1972 (‘AAT’). Pelanggaran tersebut melibatkan penyalahgunaan dadah.
Pertikaian yang timbul adalah tentang berapa banyak botol sampel air
kencing yang diperlukan untuk tujuan ujian air kencing. Bawah Garis
Panduan Tentera, hanya satu botol sahaja yang diperlukan manakala bawah
Garis Panduan KKM, dua botol diperlukan. Dalam kes responden, hanya
satu botol sampel air kencing diambil, yang telah diuji positif untuk dadah
methamphetamine dan amphetamine. Persoalan yang timbul adalah, sama
ada prosedur yang perlu diikuti adalah Garis Panduan KKM atau Garis
Panduan Tentera. Perayu juga membangkitkan isu bahawa permohonan
responden untuk relief-relief pengisytiharan adalah pramatang kerana kesnya
di mahkamah tentera masih berjalan.

dikeluarkan menurut kuasa yang diberikan oleh undang-undang. Oleh
itu, menurut kuasa s. 15 AAT, Majlis Angkatan Tentera diberi kuasa
oleh undang-undang untuk membuat peraturan yang diperlukan atau
wajar untuk melaksanakan AAT dengan lebih baik, dan ini termasuk
mengeluarkan Garis Panduan Tentera. Sebagai autoriti Majlis Angkatan
Tentera, Garis Panduan Tentera dengan itu sah dan boleh
dikuatkuasakan.
(2) Garis Panduan KKM tidak mempunyai kuasa undang-undang. Tidak
seperti Garis Panduan Tentera, Garis Panduan KKM tidak dibuat
bawah mana-mana undang-undang bertulis. Garis Panduan KKM
hanyalah garis panduan yang dikeluarkan oleh Kementerian Kesihatan
melalui satu pekeliling dan ditandatangani oleh Ketua Pengarah
Kementerian Kesihatan. Garis Panduan KKM bertujuan menyelaras dan
mengemas kini prosedur pengambilan sampel air kencing dalam kes-kes
penyalahgunaan dadah yang disyaki dan sebagai garis panduan buat
agensi-agensi relevan, termasuk angkatan tentera. Ini tidak dimaksudkan
sebagai dokumen undang-undang yang mempunyai kuasa undangundang. Agar apa-apa garis panduan yang mempunyai apa-apa kuasa
undang-undang, garis panduan tersebut harus dibuat menurut kuasa yang
diberikan oleh undang-undang. Ini bukanlah keadaannya dengan Garis
Panduan KKM.
(3) Oleh kerana prosedur yang digunakan oleh perayu dalam mengambil
hanya satu botol sampel air kencing responden untuk ujian air
kencingnya mematuhi Garis Panduan Tentera, persoalan sama ada
perayu telah melanggar Garis Panduan KKM apabila tidak mengambil
dua botol sampel air kencing tidak timbul. Dalam apa-apa jua keadaan,
jika Garis Panduan KKM mempunyai kuasa undang-undang, garis
panduan ini tidak boleh menggantikan Garis Panduan Tentera. Garis
Panduan Tentera adalah garis panduan yang khusus dikuatkuasakan oleh
angkatan tentera sahaja dan bukan oleh pihak lain dan garis panduan ini
berkuat kuasa terhadap semua ahli-ahli angkatan tentera tanpa
pengecualian.
(4) Mahkamah tentera harus dibenarkan menyelesaikan perbicaraannya,
dan jika responden tidak berpuas hati dengan keputusan pada akhir
prosiding, remedi yang perlu diambil olehnya adalah memohon
semakan bawah s. 128 AAT. Pemfailan saman pemula di tengah-tengah
prosiding di mahkamah tentera menunjukkan responden jelas
menyalahgunakan proses. Ini tidak boleh dipertimbangkan oleh
mahkamah ini.

JUDGMENT
Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:

D

[1]
This appeal was against the decision of the High Court at Ipoh
allowing the respondent’s application by way of originating summons for the
following declaratory orders:
(a) The “Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera 4/2009” (“the Army
Guideline”) dated 14 May 2009 which lays down the procedure for
testing drug abuse in urine is null and void as it does not conform to the
“Surat Pekeliling Ketua Pengarah Kesihatan Malaysia, Kementerian
Kesihatan Malaysia” dated 3 September 2002 and Garis Panduan
Bahagian Kesihatan Perkembangan Perubatan Kementerian Kesihatan
Malaysia Bilangan 6/2002” (“the KKM Guideline”); and

E

F

(b) The Army Guideline is null and void as it violates arts. 5(1) and 8(1)
of the Federal Constitution.
[2]
The issue relates to the procedure for the taking of urine specimens for
the purposes of urine tests in suspected drug abuse cases involving members
of the armed forces.
[3]
It needs to be mentioned that when the originating summons was filed
by the respondent, his trial in the court-martial was ongoing. This prompted
the appellant to apply under O. 18 r. 19(1)(b) and/or (d) of the Rules of Court
2012 to strike out the originating summons on the ground that it was
scandalous, frivolous or vexatious or was otherwise an abuse of process. The
application was dismissed by the learned High Court Judge.

Majlis Angkatan Tentera Malaysia v.

777

[4]
In allowing the respondent’s originating summons and dismissing the
appellant’s striking out application, the learned judge accepted the
respondent’s argument that the Army Guideline is null and void and of no
effect as it did not conform to the KKM Guideline.
[5]
The decision effectively means that the urine test carried out by the
appellant on the respondent was illegal as only one bottle of urine sample was
taken from him instead of two as required by the KKM Guideline. The
decision also means that the appellant will not be able to continue with the
court-martial against the respondent.
[6]
The background facts leading to the present appeal are as follows. On
9 July 2016, the respondent was charged in the court-martial for breaching
the Armed Forces Standing Order, which is an offence under s. 51 of the
Armed Forces Act 1972 (“the AFA”). The breach was for being involved in
drug abuse. The material particulars of the charge against the respondent
read:

Section 51 of the AFA under which the respondent was charged
provides as follows:

51(1) Every person subject to service law under this Act who contravenes
or fails to comply with any provision of orders to which this section
applies, being a provision known to him or which he might reasonably be
expected to know, shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or any less punishment
provided by this Act.
(2) This section applies to standing orders or other routine orders of a
continuing nature for any formation or unit or body of troops, or for any
command or other area, establishment, garrison or place, or for any ship,
train or aircraft.
(3) The standing orders or other routine orders described in subsection
(2) may be:

(b) published in such manner as may be determined by,
the Service Chief for each Service or any officer authorised by him.

[8]
The dispute that arose was over how many bottles of urine sample was
required to be taken for the purposes of a urine test. Under the Army
Guideline, only one bottle is required whereas under the KKM Guideline,
two bottles are required.
[9]
In the case of the respondent, only one bottle of his urine sample was
taken, which tested positive for the drugs methamphetamine and
amphetamine. It was this test result that formed the basis for the charge
against him. It was therefore important for the court to determine if the
procedure adopted by the appellant in collecting urine samples for the
purposes of urine tests was in accordance with the law.
[10] In a court-martial, the rules of evidence are the same as those observed
in a civil court. This is provided by s. 115 of the AFA which reads:
115(1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the rules of evidence to be
observed in proceedings before courts-martial shall be the same as those
which are observed in civil courts in Malaysia and no person shall be
required in proceedings before a court-martial to answer any question or
to produce any document which he could not be required to answer or
to produce in similar proceedings before a civil court in Malaysia.

[11] The question before us was simply this – which guideline applies, the
Army Guideline or the KKM Guideline? The learned judge ruled that it is
the KKM Guideline that applies and not the Army Guideline. The KKM
Guideline inter alia provides for the following procedure in the collection of
urine samples:

B

C

D

E

F

(c) Collection Procedure
(i) At least 30 ml urine sample shall be collected in one bottle or
duplicate if screening and confirmation are done in two different
places. The requesting officer/referring centre shall keep the second
urine sample and shall send the urine sample to the confirmation
centre if the screening result is positive.
(ii) Both the collection personnel and the donor shall keep the urine
samples in view at all times prior to it being sealed or labeled. If the
second bottle cannot be provided (sample is 30 ml only), testing
shall be done on the first sample, Absence of second sample shall
be recorded.
(iii) At the collection site, if the volume is less than 30 ml, the donor
may be given a reasonable amount of liquid to drink e.g. 240 ml of
water every 30 minutes, but not to exceed a maximum of 720 ml.

that the urine is genuinely passed out from the person and to see
that there is no attempt to falsify the specimens.

[12] Learned counsel for the respondent contended that this guideline
requires two bottles of urine sample to be taken. We read it differently. Our
reading of para. (c)(i) is that only one bottle of urine specimen is required,
but a “duplicate” ie, a second bottle is required if the screening and
confirmation are done in two different places. What is important is for the
single bottle to contain at least 30ml of urine sample.
[13] Paragraph (c)(iii) of the KKM Guideline expressly requires that if at
the collection site the volume is less than 30 ml, the donor may be given a
reasonable amount of liquid to drink eg, 240 ml of water every 30 minutes,
but not to exceed a maximum of 720 ml, and the second urine sample shall
be collected and mixed with the previous sample by the donor himself/
herself or the collection personnel in front of the donor.
[14] For a comparison of the KKM Guideline with the Army Guideline,
we reproduce below the relevant parts of the Army Guideline:
6. Proses Pungutan. Semua proses pungutan specimen air kencing perlu
mematuhi prosedur dan langkah-langkah keselamatan. Urutan kejadian
bagi perlaksanaan pungutan specimen air kencing melalui beberapa proses
seperti berikut:
…

I

e. Pemilihan Botol. Pemberi/suspek hendaklah memilih sendiri
botol ujian yang disediakan. Setelah pemberi/suspek memilih botol
tersebut, Pendaftar hendaklah menulis Nombor Kad Pengenalan/
Nombor Tentera anggota pemberi/suspek di botol tersebut dengan
menggunakan pen dakwat kekal (permanent marker pen). Ini bagi
memastikan pemberi/suspek menggunakan botol yang sama
semasa menyerahkan air kencing untuk diuji.



780

Current Law Journal

[2019] 2 CLJ

f. Kapasiti Air Kencing. Pendaftar hendaklah memaklumkan
kepada pemberi/suspek dikehendaki memberi specimen air kencing
sekurang-kurangnya 30 ml bagi setiap botol. Sekiranya pemberi/
suspek memberi kurang daripada 30 ml atau tidak boleh terkencing,
pemberi/suspek boleh diberi minuman dalam amaun yang
berpatutan iaitu lebih kurang 240 ml air bagi setiap lebih kurang 30
minit tetapi tidak boleh melebihi 720 ml.

A

B

…
l. Ujian Saringan. Sebelum membuat ujian saringan, Penguji
Saringan hendaklah terlebih dahulu memastikan Nombor Kad
Pengenalan/Nombor Tentera yang tertera di botol tersebut
kepunyaan anggota pemberi/suspek berkenaan. Pemberi/suspek
dikehendaki membuka sendiri penutup botol specimen air
kencingnya. Penguji Saringan akan membuat pengujian ke atas
specimen air kencing dengan mematuhi tatacara penggunaan alat
ujian saringan air kencing, Kaedah ujian adalah seperti berikut:
(1) Penggunaan Botol Yang Dilengkapi Kertas-Kertas Ujian
Saringan Dadah. Sekiranya ujian menunjukkan keputusan
positif dadah berbahaya botol tersebut hendaklah dilabel dan
dimeterai (seal) seterusnya dihantar ke Pusat Pengujian.
(2) Penggunaan Botol dan Alat Ujian Saringan Dadah yang
Berasingan. Bungkusan alat ujian saringan hendaklah dibuka di
hadapan pemberi/suspek. Setelah alat ujian saringan dicelup ke
dalam botol, botol tersebut hendaklah ditutup semula
sementara menunggu keputusan ujian saringan, sekiranya ujian
saringan didapati positif botol tersebut hendaklah dilabel dan
dimeterai seterusnya dihantar ke Pusat Pengujian.
(3) Pungutan Semula. Pungutan semula specimen air kencing boleh
dilaksanakan sekiranya perlu.

[15] As is the case with the KKM Guideline, the Army Guideline requires
only one bottle of urine specimen to be taken. And like the KKM Guideline,
the Army Guideline also requires each bottle to contain at least 30ml of urine
specimen. So basically the requirements of both guidelines are the same.
[16] The respondent himself accepted that the taking of two bottles
(“duplicate”) of urine sample as laid down by the KKM Guideline is only
required if the screening and confirmation are done in two different places.
This can be deduced from para. (7) of his affidavit in support where he said:
(7) Pada 26 April 2015, Cawangan Penyiasatan Khas Angkatan Tentera
Malaysia telah menjalankan satu Operasi Cegah Dadah di pasukan 2
Skuadron Semboyan Di Raja, Jalan Hospital, 30450 Ipoh, Perak. Dalam
operasi tersebut, hanya satu (1) botol sampel air kencing sahaja
dipungut daripada saya dan daripada setiap anggota pasukan 2 Skuadron

Majlis Angkatan Tentera Malaysia v.
Mohd Nurul Ami Mohd Basri

781

Semboyan Di Raja tersebut yang hendak diuji sampel air kencingnya
walau pun ujian saringan dan ujian penentuan dibuat di dua (2) tempat
yang berlainan. Ini adalah kerana Cawangan Penyiasatan Khas Angkatan
tentera Malaysia mengikut garis panduan yang di keluarkan oleh Perintah
Majlis Angkatan Tentera Bilangan 4 tahun 2009 tersebut di perenggan 6(i)
yang menyatakan bahawa satu (1) botol sampel air kencing adalah
mencukupi untuk dipungut daripada setiap anggota. (emphasis added)

[17] The respondent was merely echoing what para. (c)(i) of the KKM
Guideline requires, ie, that since the screening and confirmation were done
in two different places, two bottles of his urine sample should have been
taken by the appellant instead of just one. Going by the terms of para. (c)(i)
of the KKM Guideline, we would agree with him.
[18] But that is not the end of the matter. The question is not whether one
or two bottles should be taken, but whether the procedure to be followed by
the appellant is the KKM Guideline or the Army Guideline. If it is the KKM
Guideline that must be followed, two bottles must be taken (since the
screening and confirmation were done in two different places) but if the
Army Guideline applies, only one bottle is required.
[19] The respondent gave two reasons why the appellant must follow the
KKM Guideline and not the Army Guideline, and they are as follows:

E

F

(i) The KKM Guideline is a guideline that has been issued to all
enforcement agencies involved in the programme to detect drug abuse,
including the armed forces;
(ii) The guideline is based on the procedure adopted internationally, which
mandatorily requires for two bottles of urine sample to be taken for the
purposes of a urine test.

G

[20] We were referred by learned counsel for the respondent to the decision
of this court in Noor Shariful Rizal Noor Zawawi v. PP [2017] 4 CLJ 434;
[2017] 3 MLJ 460 where it was held that the KKM Guideline has the force
of law. The facts are these. The appellant, a policeman, was charged in the
Magistrate’s Court with the offence of consuming proscribed drug under
s. 15(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 read with s. 38B(1) of the same
Act.

H

[21] He was convicted and sentenced to seven months imprisonment. The
conviction was affirmed by the High Court. On a successful appeal to this
court, he was acquitted and discharged of the offence.

I

[22] Like the respondent in the present appeal, his urine sample tested
positive for methamphetamine. His complaint was also similar, ie, only one
bottle of urine sample was taken from him for the purposes of a urine test.
This according to the appellant was in breach of the Inspector General of



782

Current Law Journal

[2019] 2 CLJ

Police Standing Order F103 (“the IGSO”) which requires two bottles (the
Army Guideline requires only one bottle) to be taken, which is the same
requirement as laid down by the KKM Guideline.
[23] The prosecution argued that the IGSO and the KKM Guideline, being
merely administrative guidelines, had no force of law. The appellant argued
otherwise. This court acceded to the appellant’s argument. Zamani A Rahim
JCA delivering the judgment of the court said at p. 472:
[39] There are several standing orders covering various police jobs such
as the maintenance of station diaries, the procedure to hold an
identification parade in criminal cases which is regulated by the IGSO Part
D 226, and the procedure to collect urine samples from suspected drug
dependents which is housed in the IGSO F103. The standing orders
made by the Inspector-General of Police, which necessarily include the
IGSO F103 acquires its statutory power from s. 97 of the Police Act 1967.
Therefore, it has the force of law.
[40] The KKM Guidelines Bilangan 6/2002 under the caption ‘Urine
Collection’ has made reference to the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. The
scheme of the KKM Guidelines Bilangan 6/2002 was formulated in
collaboration with the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and also the Drug
Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983.
…

D

E

[42] Thus, s. 31 of the Drugs Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation)
Act 1983 must be read conjointly with ss. 38A and 38B of the Dangerous
Drugs Act 1952. Therefore, the KKM Guidelines Bilangan 6/2002 which
is formulated in line with both the aforesaid Acts and therefore it has the
force of law.
F

[24] It is clear that the reason why the IGSO and the KKM Guideline were
held by this court to have the force of law was because they were either made
under or were in line with the relevant laws, namely s. 97 of the Police Act
1967 in the case of the IGSO and the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and the
Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983 in the case of the
KKM Guideline.

[25] On the authority Noor Shariful Rizal (supra), the learned judge came to
the following conclusion:
[30] Dari keputusan Mahkamah Rayuan tersebut juga, nyatalah bahawa
ketidakpatuhan defendan mengikuti garis panduan yang ditetapkan
Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia bukan sahaja menyebabkan prosedur
pungutan dan pengendalian specimen air kencing di bawah Perintah
4/2009 tidak sah, malahan ianya juga bertentangan dengan hak keadilan
asasi yang dijamin di bawah Perlembagaan Persekutuan. Mana mungkin
plaintiff sebagai seorang anggota tentera mendapat layanan yang berbeza
berbanding dengan orang awam. Perbezaan tersebut tidak boleh
dibenarkan wujud kerana akan menggugat hak asasi plaintif di bawah

Perlembagaan Persekutuan. Plaintif tidak sewajarnya didiskriminasikan

[26] What then is the status of the Army Guideline? Does it have any force
of law? In our view it does. The first thing to note is that it was made under
s. 15 of the AFA read together with art. 137 of the Federal Constitution (“the
Constitution”).
[27] The Army Guideline, which can be found at pp. 70-80 of the appeal
record is dated 14 May 2009 and was signed by the Secretary of the Armed
Forces Council. He signed it “Dengan Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera”.
There can be no doubt therefore that the Army Guideline is a guideline that
was issued pursuant to a power given by law.
[28]

We reproduce below art. 137 of the Constitution and s. 15 of the AFA:

Article 137(1) of the Constitution
D

Armed Forces Council
137(1) There shall be an Armed Forces Council, which shall be responsible
under the general authority of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for the
command, discipline and administration of, and all other matters relating
to the armed forces, other than matters relating to their operational use.

E

Section 15 of the AFA
Regulations governing commissioning, etc., of officers

F

G

H

I

15. The Armed Forces Council with the approval of the Yang di-Pertuan
Agong may make regulations including regulations providing for matters
which may be issued by Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera governing the
commissioning and appointment of officers, their terms of service,
including the absorption, attachment and secondment of any officer to
any body, force or service, promotion, advancement in rank, retirement,
resignation, dismissal and such other matters as the Armed Forces
Council may think necessary or expedient for the better carrying into
effect of the provisions of this Part.
(emphasis added)

[29] Thus, by virtue of s. 15 of the AFA, the Armed Forces Council is
empowered by law to make regulations it may think necessary or expedient
for the better carrying into effect of the AFA, and this includes issuing the
Army Guideline, which was issued by way of the “Perintah Majlis Angkatan
Tentera”. Being made by authority of the Armed Forces Council, the Army
Guideline is therefore valid and enforceable.
[30] What about the KKM Guideline, does it have any force of law? With
regret and with the greatest of respect to the panel of this court that decided
Noor Shariful Rizal (supra), we are unable to agree that the KKM Guideline
has the force of law. In the first place, unlike the Army Guideline, it was
not made under any written law.

[31] The KKM Guideline was merely a guideline issued by the Ministry
of Health through a Circular dated 3 September 2002 and signed by the
Director General of the Ministry of Health. The fact that the KKM
Guideline makes references to the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 as observed
by this court in Noor Shariful Rizal does not clothe it with the force of law.

A

[32] Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Circular fortifies our view that it is merely
an administrative guideline with no force of law. We reproduce below the
two paragraphs which can be found at p. 43 of the appeal record:

Surat Pekeliling Ketua Pengarah Kesihatan Malaysia Bil. 6/2002
Garispanduan Bagi Ujian Pengesananan Penyalahgunaan Dadah Dalam
Air Kencing

C

1. Tujuan
Surat ini bertujuan untuk memaklumkan mengenai garispanduan bagi
ujian pengesanan penyalahgunaan dadah. Ini adalah untuk menyeragamkan
dan mengemaskini prosidur-prosidur ujian pengesanan dadah di makmal-makmal
Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia (KKM) serta sebagai panduan bagi agensi-agensi
yang terlibat dalam program pengesanan dadah seperti Agensi Dadah
Kebangsaan dan Polis. Selain daripada itu garispanduan ini akan
memudahkan proses menulis dokumen kerana terdapat penyeragaman
prosedur bagi proses mendapatkan pensijilan ISO/IEC 17025 serta dapat
menghasilkan keputusan ujian berkualiti dan diakui kerana semua
prosidur dijalankan dengan mengambilkira isu keselamatan, kerahsiaan,
kawalan kualiti dan berpandu kepada prosidur-prosidur di peringkat
antarabangsa.

D

E

2. Latarbelakang
Garispanduan ini disediakan berlanjutan dari Bengkel Polisi dan Prosidur
Ujian Dadah pada tahun 2000 di mana banyak pertanyaan mengenai
polisi dan prosidur samada teknikal atau perundangan telah dikemukakan
oleh peserta-peserta yang menghadiri bengkel itu.
Berikutan dengan itu, satu Jawatankuasa Teknikal Polisi dan Prosidur
telah diwujudkan yang dianggotai oleh Pakar Patologi, Pegawai Sains dan
Juruteknologi Perubatan. Di bawah jawatankuasa ini terdapat dua
jawatankuasa kerja iaitu, Jawatankuasa Polisi dan Prosidur Ujian Dadah
serta Jawatankuasa Quality Assurance dan Latihan.
Jawatankuasa Teknikal Polisi dan Prosidur Ujian Dadah telah
mengadakan beberapa siri mesyuarat serta perbincangan dengan lain
agensi seperti pihak Polis dan pihak Peguam Negara dan telah berjaya
mengeluarkan satu garispanduan Guidelines For Drugs Abuse Testing
untuk rujukan makmal-makmal pengesanan dadah di Kementerian
Kesihatan dan agensi-agensi berkaitan di negara ini. (emphasis added)

Majlis Angkatan Tentera Malaysia v.
Mohd Nurul Ami Mohd Basri

785

[33] It is patently clear that the purpose of the KKM Guideline is to coordinate and update the procedure for the taking of urine samples in
suspected drug abuse cases and as a guideline to the relevant agencies,
including the armed forces. It was not meant to be a legal document having
the force of law. For any guideline to have any force of law, it must be made
pursuant to a power given by law. This is not the case with the KKM
Guideline.
[34] Since the procedure adopted by the appellant in taking only one bottle
of the respondent’s urine specimen for his urine test was in accordance with
the Army Guideline, the question that the appellant had breached the KKM
Guideline by not taking two bottles of his urine sample does not arise, and
this is so even if the KKM Guideline has the force of law, and assuming we
are wrong in holding the view that it has no force of law.

D

[35] In any event, even if the KKM Guideline has the force of law, it
cannot supersede the Army Guideline. This is because the Army Guideline
is a specific guideline which is meant to be enforced by the armed forces only
and by no others and it is enforceable against all members of the armed forces
without any exception.

E

[36] The appellant also raised the issue that the respondent’s application for
declaratory reliefs was premature as his case before the court-martial was
ongoing. We agree. The respondent should have waited for the court-martial
to be completed before filing any action in the High Court.

F

[37] The court-martial must be allowed to complete its hearing, and if the
respondent is dissatisfied with the decision at the conclusion of the
proceedings, his remedy is to apply for a review under s. 128 of the AFA.
By filing the originating summons in the midst of the court-martial, the
respondent was clearly abusing the process. This must not be countenanced
by this court.

G

H

I

[38] It was for all the reasons aforesaid that we allowed the appellant’s
appeal against the High Court decision allowing the respondent’s originating
summons. We therefore ordered the decision of the High Court to be set
aside. We awarded costs of RM5,000 to the appellant. The deposit was
refunded.
