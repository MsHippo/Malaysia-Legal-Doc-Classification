CRIMINAL LAW: Dangerous drugs – Trafficking – Drugs found in car and pocket
of trousers – Whether drugs seized analysed and confirmed by chemist to be
dangerous drugs – Whether drugs tampered with – Whether there was proper
handling of drug exhibits – Whether there was break in chain of evidence –
Whether ingredients of trafficking satisfied – Whether prosecution successfully
established prima facie case – Penal Code, ss. 39B(1)(a) & 12(2)
EVIDENCE: Witness – Credibility – Testimony of witness in drug-trafficking
charge – Whether testimony reliable – Whether testimony probable – Whether
statements consistent – Whether there were discrepancies – Whether safe to accept
testimony of witness
Acting upon information received that a certain drug-trafficking activity
would take place, a team of narcotic officers carried out a surveillance at a
petrol station. Half an hour later, a silver car driven by the first accused
entered and stopped at the petrol station. This was followed, 15 minutes
later, by a black car driven by the second accused which pulled over behind
the silver car. The first accused alighted from his car and walked to the black
car holding a package. This package was handed over to the second accused
who, in exchange, gave the first accused another package. The ambush team
sprung into action and arrested the accused persons. A search (i) on the silver
car revealed a package which contained a crystalline substance suspected to
be drugs; (ii) on the black car revealed cash; (iii) on the first accused led to
the discovery of 21 pills in the pocket of his trousers; and (iv) on the second
accused found no incriminating items. The substance found in the silver car
was later confirmed to be 393.9g of methamphethamine while the pills found
on the first accused were confirmed to be 0.15g of nimetazepam. The accused
persons were jointly charged for drug-trafficking, an offence under
s. 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (‘the Act’). The first accused
also faced another charge under s. 12(2) of the Act. The Deputy Superintendent
of Police (‘DSP Anuar’) who led the ambush, testified that (i) he had testified
against the second accused in an earlier case (‘the earlier case’); (ii) after the
drugs were seized, they were handed to Inspector Faizal for the same to be
brought to IPK Kuala Lumpur when he left to search the second accused’s
home; and (iii) upon his return to IPK Kuala Lumpur, Inspector Faizal
handed the drugs back to him and he handed the same to the investigating
officer after labelling them. In his testimony, Inspector Faizal stated that
DSP Anuar did hand the drugs to him when the former left to search the
second accused’s house.

Held (acquitting and discharging accused persons):
(1) The prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case against the accused
persons. An essential ingredient to sustain the offence of trafficking is
possession of drugs. It was imperative for the prosecution to prove that
the drugs analysed and confirmed by the chemist to be dangerous drugs
were the drugs recovered from the accused. This must be done by
showing that there was no break in the chain of evidence from the time
the drugs were seized until they were sent to the chemist for analysis and
were not tampered with in any manner. The drugs were seized at
7.15pm on 30 November 2014 and were handed to the investigating
officer at 5.05am the following day, which was some ten hours later.
The prosecution failed to prove that the drugs analysed by the chemist
were in fact the drugs seized and the same had not been tampered with.
(paras 22, 25, 32 & 33)
(2) The evidence of a witness could be termed unreliable if (i) it is
inherently improbable; (ii) he made mutually contradictory or
inconsistent statements; (iii) his oral evidence is contradicted by the
contemporaneous evidence; and (iv) his demeanour, while under
examination, is found to be abnormal and unsatisfactory. (para 24)
(3) DSP Anuar’s testimony in the present case was inconsistent with his
evidence in the earlier case. In the earlier case, he testified that he took
the drugs with him in his car when he left to conduct a search on the
second accused’s house and the drugs remained in the car when he went
up to the apartment to carry out the search. The two accounts given by
DSP Anuar were diametrically opposed. The discrepancy in the two
accounts was serious, material and could not be dismissed as
inconsequential. Both the accounts given by DSP Anuar could not be
true. It was not safe to accord any weight to either account. (paras 25,
26 & 28)
(4) Apart from the bare assertion of Inspector Faizal, there was no other
evidence to prove the drugs were in fact handed to him. In any act of
transfer of possession of criminal exhibits, especially so in capital
punishment cases, there must be an acknowledgment or some
documentary proof to establish that there was a proper handling of the
exhibits. Documentary proof of handover of this vital piece of evidence
is a sine qua non in capital offences. In the absence of proof, it was not
safe to accept the bare assertion of Inspector Faizal’s testimony. There
was a serious doubt as to whether the drugs analysed by the chemist
were the drugs seized at the petrol station. (paras 29-30)

Case For The Prosecution

A

[4]
The prosecution called five witnesses. According to the prosecution
evidence, at about 5.45pm on 30 November 2014, DSP Anuar bin Hj Md
Azali (PW2) (“DSP Anuar”), acting on information received, led a team of
eight narcotics officers to a Petron station at Sg Besi along the Kuala LumpurSeremban Highway. The officers in his team included Inspector Faizal bin
Mohd Ali (“Inspector Faizal”) (PW3) and Sub Inspector Dalila binti
Mansor. The raiding team arrived there at about 6.30pm and split into two
groups and lay in wait.

B

[5]
DSP Anuar testified that at about 7pm, a silver Mercedes Benz
bearing Singapore registration number “SKC 7188 A” entered the Petron
station and stopped there. They kept the car under surveillance. About
15 minutes later, a black Nissan Almera bearing registration number “WA
6843 P” entered the station and pulled up behind the Mercedes Benz. The
first accused was the driver of the Mercedes-Benz, whilst the second accused
was the driver of the Nissan Almera. The first accused alighted from the
Mercedes Benz and walked to the Nissan Almera holding a black package
which he handed over to the second accused, who in exchange gave the
former another black package which he took to his car.
[6]
DSP Anuar gave instructions to the raiding team to surround the cars.
He and his team approached the Mercedes-Benz, whilst Inspector Faizal and
his team approached the Nissan Almera. The first and second accused, who
were the sole occupants in the respective cars, were arrested. After
administering the caution under s. 37A(1)(b) of the Act to both accused
persons, DSP Anuar and his team proceeded to search the Mercedes-Benz
in the presence of the first accused. A black package (exh. P7) was found on
the front passenger seat. Inside it was a small box, and in the box, there was
a clear plastic bag (exh. P8A) that contained a crystalline substance suspected
to be drugs.
[7]
Continuing with his testimony, DSP Anuar testified that he then
searched the first accused and found 21 pills suspected to be eramin 5 in his
front left trouser pocket. He saw Inspector Faizal and his team search the
Nissan Almera. On being told by Inspector Faizal, he had found cash in the
Nissan Almera, he walked over and had a look at it. No incriminating items
were found on the body of the second accused.
[8]
DSP Anuar said that after he had seized the items found in the
possession of the accused persons, he sought the assistance of Inspector Faizal
to take the first accused and the items to IPK Kuala Lumpur, whilst he
proceeded to the second accused’s house in Jalan Semantan to conduct a
search. After the search on the second accused’s house was completed, he
returned to IPK Kuala Lumpur and labelled the items he had seized at the

Petron station by writing the date and placing his signature on them. Two
search lists (exhs. P13 and 16) were prepared to show the items recovered
from each car. The search list P16 showed that among the items seized from
the Nissan Almera, included cash amounting to RM43,800. The accused
person and the items seized were then taken to IPD Serdang and at 5am on
1 December 2014, handed to investigating officer Inspector Mohd Raqib bin
Abu Bakar (PW3) (“the investigating officer”).
[9]
DSP Anuar was subjected to lengthy cross-examination aimed at
establishing that his version of the facts was not correct. DSP Anuar accepted
that he and one Sub-Inspector Dalila, who was part of the raiding team, had
given evidence against the second accused in the Kuala Lumpur High Court
in Case No 45A-31-05-2015 (“the earlier case”). He acknowledged that the
subject matter of the charge in the earlier case concerned drugs found in the
second accused’s house. He accepted that there in the earlier case, he had
testified that when the two cars arrived at the Petron station, he and his team
immediately stopped and checked the cars. Drugs were found in the first
accused’s car but nothing was seized from the second accused’s car. Both he
and Sub-Inspector Dalila did not allude to any exchange of drugs and money
between the second and first accused.
[10] Based on the foregoing, it was put to DSP Anuar that his testimony
in the present case that there was exchange of drugs and money between the
accused persons, and that police found cash in the second accused’s car were
lies. DSP denied the suggestions put to him and maintained that his evidence
was the truth. He said that the reason the exchange was not mentioned in the
earlier case was because it was not relevant to the charge. He said that the
exchange of money and drugs was not mentioned in his police report as it
was not important.
[11] The next witness, Inspector Faizal corroborated DSP Anuar’s
testimony that there was an exchange of drugs and money between the first
and second accused at the Petron station. He also corroborated DSP Anuar’s
evidence that he recovered cash amounting to RM43,800 from the second
accused’s car.
[12] The investigating officer in his evidence confirmed receiving the
seized exhibits from DSP Anuar. He added that he made his own markings
on the exhibits, and the exhibits suspected to be drugs were sealed in a box
and sent to government chemist, Suhana bt Ismail (PW1) for chemical
analysis who confirmed that the substance in the package contained 393.9g
of methamphetamine, and the 21 pills contained 0.15g nimetazepam, which
are dangerous drugs as listed in the First Schedule of the Act.



506

Current Law Journal

[2018] 7 CLJ

[13] The investigating officer was also subjected to lengthy crossexamination. The certified copy of the notes of proceedings in the earlier case
was produced through him and marked as ‘IDD45’. He acknowledged that
both DSP Anuar and Inspector Faizal did not mention anything to him about
having seen the exchange of drugs and money between the first and second
accused.
[14] The defence of the accused persons was then put to the investigating
officer, to wit, (a) that the drugs recovered from the car driven by the first
accused belonged to one Abang Mat who had alighted from the car on
arriving at the Petron station; (b) that the first accused had travelled and
Abang Mat had come there from Johor and (c) that the monies recovered
from the second accused’s car were monies that the latter had brought to the
Petron station to hand over to the first accused at the behest of his sister.
[15] PW4, Inspector Faizulnizam bin Abu Kassim testified that the money
seized from the second accused’s car was forfeited under the Dangerous
Drugs (Forfeiture of Property) Act 1988.

A

B

C

D

[16] That essentially was the evidence for the prosecution against both the
accused persons.
[17] I will at this juncture deal with exh. IDD45. Counsel for the accused
applied for it to be marked as an exhibit under s. 114(e) of the Evidence Act
1950. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor resisted the application on the
basis that the investigating officer was not the maker of the document and had
no personal knowledge of what transpired at the proceedings.
[18]

E

Section 114(e) of the Evidence Act relied on by counsel reads:

The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to
have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events,
human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the
facts of the particular case.
…

F

G

(e) that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed.

[19] Based on the rule embodied in s. 114(e), I ruled that it could be
presumed that IDD45 was an accurate record of the testimony given by the
witnesses called at the earlier trial. I therefore marked it as an exhibit.
Ingredients Of The Offence

H

[20] To prove the first charge against the accused persons, it was incumbent
on the prosecution to prove:
i. that the substance found in the car was dangerous drugs within the
definition of section 2 of the Act; and

I



[2018] 7 CLJ
A

PP v. Sopian Othman & Anor
And Another Case

507

ii. that the accused person had mens rea possession of the drugs i.e.
they had physical custody and control of the drugs and knowledge
that it was dangerous drugs; and
iii. that the accused persons had common intention to traffic in the
drugs.

B

And, to prove the second charge against the first accused:
i. that the substance found in the jeans of the first accused was
dangerous drugs within the definition of section 2 of the Act: and

C

ii. that he had mens rea possession of the drugs i.e. he had physical
custody or control of the drugs and knowledge that it was
dangerous drugs; and

G

H

I

[21] After considering the prosecution’s evidence and submissions of both
sides, I found that the prosecution had failed to prove ingredient (i). My
reasons were as follows.
[22] An essential ingredient to sustain the offence of trafficking is
possession of the drugs. To establish ingredient (i), it is imperative for the
prosecution to prove that the drugs analysed and confirmed by the chemist
to be dangerous drugs were the drugs recovered from the accused. This must
be done by showing that there was no break in the chain of evidence from
the time the drugs were seized until they were sent to the government chemist
for analysis, and were not tampered with in any manner. See PP lwn. Bazleh
Saeid Saleh & Satu Lagi [2014] 6 CLJ 979 and Pavone v. PP (No 2) [1985] 1
LNS 99; [1986] 1 MLJ 423.
[23] The Federal Court in PP v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ 457
gave guidance as to the correct approach to be adopted by the court when
considering the evidence of the witnesses called by the prosecution at the
close of the prosecution’s case. It was said:
What is required of a subordinate court and the High Court under the
amended sections is to call for the defence when it is satisfied that a prima
facie case has been made out at the close of the prosecution case. This
requires the court to undertake a maximum evaluation of the prosecution
evidence when deciding whether to call on the accused to enter upon his
or her defence. It involves an assessment of the credibility of the
witnesses called by the prosecution and the drawing of inferences
admitted by the prosecution evidence. Thus, if the prosecution evidence
admits of two or more inferences, one of which is in the accused’s favour,
then it is the duty of the court to draw the inference that is favourable
to the accused. See Tai Chai Keh v. Public Prosecutor [1948-49] MLJ Supp
105: Public Prosecutor v. Kasmin bin Soeb [1974] 1 MLJ 230. If the court, upon
a maximum evaluation of the evidence placed before it at the close of the



508

Current Law Journal

[2018] 7 CLJ

prosecution case, comes to the conclusion that a prima facie case has not
been made out, it should acquit the accused. If, on the other hand, the
court after conducting a maximum evaluation of the evidence comes to
the conclusion that a prima facie case has been made out, it must call for
the defence.

A

[24] For the purpose of assessing the credibility of a witness, the court has
to consider how the witness stood up to cross-examination and the
impression created by his evidence, taken in context of other facts of the case.
The evidence of a witness can be termed unreliable if; (a) it is inherently
improbable; (b) he has made mutually contradictory or inconsistent
statements; (c) his oral evidence is contradicted by the contemporaneous
evidence, and; (d) his demeanour, while under examination, is found
abnormal and unsatisfactory.

B

[25] To prove that there was no break in the chain of evidence, the
prosecution relied on the testimony of DSP Anuar and Inspector Faizal. It
was not in dispute that the drugs were seized at 7.15pm on 30 November
2014 and were handed to the investigating officer at 5.05am, the following
day some 10 hours later. I shall examine DSP Anuar’s evidence, first. It was
his testimony that after the drugs had been seized, he handed them to
Inspector Faizal for the same to be brought to IPK KL when he left to search
the second accused’s house. He further testified that upon his return to IPK
Kuala Lumpur, Inspector Faizal handed the drugs back to him and he handed
them to the investigating officer after labelling the same. It is noteworthy that
his testimony was inconsistent with his evidence in the earlier case. There,
DSP Anuar had testified that he took the drugs with him in his car when he
headed to Semantan to conduct a search on the second accused’s house, and
the drugs remained in the car when he went up to the apartment to carry out
the search.
[26] The two accounts given by DSP Anuar were diametrically opposed.
The discrepancy in the two accounts was serious, material and could not be
dismissed as inconsequential. It is settled law, as noted earlier, that when a
witness makes two statements which differ in material particulars, this has
the effect of rendering his evidence suspect and constitutes sufficient ground
for believing that he was not a truthful witness. See Lee Kwan Woh v. PP
[2009] 5 CLJ 631; [2009] 5 MLJ 301. There is no requirement in law that
a witness credit has to be impeached for his evidence to be disbelieved. Both
the accounts given by DSP Anuar could not be true. Either DSP Anuar lied
during the earlier case or he was lying now.
[27] Thomson CJ in Khoon Chye Hin v. PP [1961] 1 LNS 41; [1961] MLJ
105 in regard to inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness observed at
107:

When a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is
clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest
of his evidence must be scrutinised with great care and indeed with
suspicion. To say, however, that because a witness has been proved to be
a liar on one or two points then the whole of his evidence “must in law
be rejected” is to go too far and is wrong. (emphasis added)

[28] In the absence of an explanation, it was impossible to tell which of the
two versions advanced by DSP Anuar was the true version. It was thus not
safe to accord any weight to either account. It was probable that the change
in DSP Anuar’s evidence was prompted by his realisation that his testimony
in the earlier case that he had left the drugs unattended in his car, could
adversely affect the prosecution’s case. It was possible that he was lying in
a stupid attempt to bolster a genuine case.
[29]
That brings me to the evidence of Inspector Faizal who it will be
recalled said that DSP Anuar handed the drugs to him when he left to search
the second accused’s house. Apart from the bare assertion of Inspector
Faizal, there was no other evidence to prove the drugs were in fact handed
to him. In any act of transfer of possession of criminal exhibits, especially
so in capital punishment cases, there must be an acknowledgement or some
documentary proof to establish that there was a proper handling of the
exhibits.
[30] If indeed, DSP Anuar had handed the drugs to Inspector Faizal, it
would be reasonable to expect an acknowledgement to that effect by the
latter. Documentary proof of handover of this vital piece of evidence is a sine
qua non in capital offences. In the absence of proof, it was not safe to accept
the bare assertion of Inspector Faizal’s testimony. There was a serious doubt
as to whether the drugs analysed by the chemist were the drugs seized at the
Petron station.
[31] In Zaifull Muhammad v. PP & Another Appeal [2013] 2 CLJ 383; [2013]
2 MLJ 348, the Federal Court explained the importance of proving the
identity of the drugs analysed by the chemist:
The prosecution further argued that based on the evidence before the
court, there is no break in the chain of the evidence with regard to the
Drug exhibit. The prosecution submitted that all the relevant witnesses
called by the prosecution had positively identified the Drug exhibit based
on the contemporaneous markings made by the witnesses. On that
premise, the prosecution contended that the discrepancies do not create
any doubt in the identity of the Drug exhibit.
With respect, we could not agree with the prosecution on this issue. We
are of the view that, in the circumstance of this case, it is incumbent on
the prosecution to offer some explanation for the discrepancies. With the
discrepancies left unexplained, this created a reasonable doubt as to the
identity of the Drug exhibit. In the circumstance, the defence should not
have been called at the close of the prosecution case …

[32] For the reasons stated, I found that the prosecution had failed to prove
ingredient (i) ie, that the drugs analysed by the chemist were in fact the drugs
seized and the same had not been tampered with.

[33] I therefore found that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie
