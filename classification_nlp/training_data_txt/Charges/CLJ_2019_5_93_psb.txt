The applicant, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences under the Penal Code, the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (‘MACCA’) and the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities
Act 2001 (‘AMLATFAPUA’). In the present application, the applicant

sought for pre-trial production, by the respondent (‘the prosecution’), of
statements and documents given by potential witnesses to the officers of the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (‘MACC’) in the course of the
investigation. In support of his application, the applicant submitted that
(i) the non obstante clauses, in s. 30(9) of the MACCA and s. 40 of the
AMLATFAPUA, rendered the statements recorded and documents collected
during the course of investigations automatically admissible as evidence, at
the behest of either party to the proceedings in question; (ii) given the
automatic admissibility, arts. 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution (‘FC’)
demand that copies of the said documents and statements must be supplied,
by the prosecution, to the applicant before the commencement of the trial;
and (iii) the crux of the applicant’s case was also supported by s. 51A of the
Criminal Procedure Code (‘CPC’) and s. 62 of the MACCA. Resisting the
application, the prosecution argued that (i) the applicant misconstrued the
application of the non obstante clauses, in s. 30(9) of the MACCA and s. 40
of the AMLATFAPUA, to exclude all other legislations or provisions in
force on other statutes, particularly the Evidence Act 1950, as this could not
have been the intention of the Legislature; (ii) the non obstante clauses must
be read subject to the rules of privilege and the prohibition on the grounds
of public policy; and (iii) the interpretation of arts. 5 and 8 of the FC by the
applicant would mean the automatic admissibility of the documents,
pursuant to the non obstante clauses, necessarily require disclosure of copies
of such documents by either side.

Held (dismissing application):
(1) The applicant had not made out a case as to the extent to which the
Legislature had intended to give the relevant non obstante clauses
overriding effect over all other rules and legal provisions. In any event,
the weight of authorities on the subject, particularly in two Federal
Court decisions, namely Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail and
Ho Tak Sien & Ors v. Rotta Research Laboratorium SPA, which required
specific identification of the rules to be excluded, provided a valid and
compelling basis not to subscribe to the proposition advanced by the
applicant that the non obstante clauses in the instant case would have
effect of, without more, automatically rendering the statements and
documents admissible obtained by the MACC as evidence in any
proceeding. (para 27)
(2) The fundamental liberties in art. 5 of the FC, by its very words, are not
absolute. Neither is the principle of equality in art. 8 of the FC
immutably entrenched. Furthermore, the applicant had not
demonstrated how he was discriminated against, compared to other
persons under investigation by the MACC under the MACCA. As such,
despite the wordings in the non obstante clauses, such admissibility could

not mean the applicant was entitled to the statements and documents
applied for, and defeat considerations on claims of privilege and public
policy against such production of the said documents. (paras 34-35 & 40)
(3) Section 51A of the CPC and s. 62 of the MACCA are not concerned with
the issue of admissibility. Failure to adhere to these disclosure
obligations do not affect admissibility simply because they do not form
a substantive due process but instead constitute only procedural
requirements. Section 62 reinforces the law on s. 51A of the CPC and,
in the absence of provisions similar to ss. 51 and 51A of the CPC in the
MACCA and the AMLATFAPUA, the jurisprudence on these two
provisions of the CPC would govern rules on production of statements
and documents under the MACCA and the AMLATFAPUA. (paras 49
& 55)
(4) As reliance could not be had to the non obstante clauses to warrant
production of the documents requested for by the applicant, the present
application could only be premised on s. 51 of the CPC, which
empowers the court to compel any person to produce any document or
thing necessary in a trial of a judicial proceeding. However, s. 51 of the
CPC must be construed strictly because its purpose is to provide limited
access and its scope is fairly restricted. It could not be invoked to justify
full disclosure of the prosecution’s case. (paras 60 & 62)
(5) Leading authorities and cases established and reaffirmed, inter alia, the
propositions of law that (i) an application under s. 51 of the CPC must
satisfy the requirements of necessity and desirability in s. 51 itself and
these would, in turn, depend on the stage of proceeding the application
is made; (ii) where the application is made before the commencement
of trial, like in the present case, the discovery must be limited to matters
that are specified in the charge; (iii) the court is not, and should not put
itself, in a position to anticipate how the prosecution intends to conduct
its case; (iv) an accused cannot seek the inspection or discovery of
documents seized in the course of police investigation since to do so
would tantamount to inspection of the evidence of the prosecution by
the defence; (v) the entitlement of the accused, under s. 51 of the CPC,
to any document or copies of documents or other materials in the
possession of the prosecution is entirely at the discretion of the court,
having regard to the justice of the case; (vi) where an application is made
before the commencement of the inquiry or trial, as in the present case,
the general rule is that the request must be directed at a specific
document. A general direction to produce all papers relating to the
subject in dispute would not be enforced; and (vii) if the application is
made during the trial, the accused would be entitled to discovery if the
documents satisfy the test of relevancy and is essential for adjudication
based on evidence before the court. (paras 66, 68, 73, 75 & 77-80)

[2019] 5 CLJ

(6) The instant application concerned the stage before the commencement
of the trial. The applicant sought two principal types of information
from the prosecution, namely, (i) statements given by potential
witnesses to the MACC; and (ii) other documents obtained by the
MACC under the relevant provisions compelling production, embodied
in the MACCA and the AMLATFAPUA, in the course of its
investigation pertaining to the charges against the applicant. The other
prayers in the notice of motion were no longer relevant as they
concerned statements and documents taken from the applicant himself
which have all been supplied to the applicant, in compliance with s. 51A
of the CPC. The law governing the supply of such statements to an
accused before trial, as stated in Husdi v. PP, is free from ambiguity. An
accused is not entitled to copies of police statements recorded from
witnesses in the course of investigations. Firstly, a statement taken from
a witness is a privileged document. Secondly, as a matter of public
policy, it is not desirable for the prosecution to provide the accused with
such statement as there is a real danger of tampering with witnesses. The
key request of the applicant, for copies of the statements made by other
persons to the MACC, could not be sustained. The application
absolutely failed the test of ‘necessity’ and ‘desirability’ under s. 51 of
the CPC. (paras 81-84 & 89)
(7) Section 51A promotes fair trial by compelling the prosecution to deliver
to an accused, before the commencement of a trial, all documents that
the prosecution intend to tender as part of the evidence for the
prosecution. In addition, the prosecution must also provide to the
accused, before trial, a written statement of facts favourable to the
defence of the accused. The applicant sought to inspect statements and
documents procured and obtained by the MACC in the course of
investigations which the prosecution did not intend to tender to prove
the charges against the applicant. These were unused documents of the
prosecution. The prosecution affirmed that s. 51A of the CPC had been
adhered to. The potential for a trial by ambush had been much
minimised by the said compliance. The prosecution had also affirmed
that it had given a written statement that there were no facts favourable
to the accused in compliance with s. 51A(1)(c) of the CPC. In other
words, the prosecution asserted that the unused documents, or the other
documents and statements which were not proposed to be tendered to
prove its case but were now required by the applicant, did not disclose
any facts that could assist the defence. This further weakened the
case for the applicant for discovery of those statements and documents.
(paras 102-105)
(8) The fact that the statements were taken by the MACC, and not the
police, did not change the position of the law. Matters concerning public
policy, privileged documents and witness-tampering are similarly
relevant even if investigations are under a different legislation, such as

the MACCA and the AMLATFAPUA. The investigators of the MACC
are also considered public officers under the MACCA, thus attracting
the application of s. 124 of the Evidence Act 1950, which means that
communication made to the officers of the MACC, in official
confidence, could not be compelled to be disclosed if they consider that
public interest would suffer by such disclosure. (paras 117 & 118)

JUDGMENT

A

Mohd Nazlan Ghazali J:
Introduction
[1]
This is an application by the defence for the pre-trial production by
the prosecution of statements and documents given by potential witnesses to
the officers of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in the course of
investigation.
[2]
At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the application and
highlighted the principal reasons for the same. This judgment sets out the full
reasons for the refusal.

B

C

Key Background Facts
[3]
The applicant is accused of seven criminal charges concerning offences
under the Penal Code, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009
(“the MACC Act”) and the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism
Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001
(“the AMLATFA”). On 8 August 2018, all seven charges were ordered by
this High Court to be jointly tried. Trial dates have been fixed, to commence
on 12 February 2019 and to continue until 29 March 2019.
[4]
The applicant then filed a notice of motion, essentially seeking the
production by the prosecution of a list of various documents, statements and
information. At a subsequent case management, parties agreed to discuss
various outstanding matters at a pre-trial conference that parties had not been
able to convene much earlier.
[5]
At a further case management, parties updated the court that the
prosecution had by then delivered all the documents under s. 51A of the
Criminal Procedure Code (“the CPC”) in 23 volumes in printed hard copy
physical version, and properly listed as well as indexed as previously agreed
at the earlier case management.

E

F

G

[6]
Given the stated compliance with s. 51A, and the parties agreeing to
a number of other requests during the pre-trial conference, the scope of the
instant application before me is now limited only to prayers 1(g), 1(h), 1(i),
1(j) and 2(b)(i) of the notice of motion, which, for clarity, read as follows:
1(g) records of all examinations and/or written statements on oath or
affirmations obtained pursuant to Section 30(1)(a) and/or Section 30(8)
and/or Section 30(1)(c) of the MACCA 2009 and/or Section 32(2)(a)
and/or Section 32(2)(c) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism
Financing And Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (“AMLAFTA
2001”) during the course of investigations which have culminated into the
subject matter of the SRC Proceedings;
1(h) all books, documents, records, accounts or computerised data or
articles obtained pursuant to Section 30(1)(b) of the MACCA 2009 or
otherwise in the course of examinations under Section 30(1)(a) of the

B

1(j) alternatively in lieu of paragraph 1(g), (h) and (i) above, a complete
listing of the following:
(i) the names of all the examinees and dates of recordings of the
records of their respective examinations and/or written statements
on oath or affirmations obtained pursuant to Section 30(1)(a) and/
or Section 30(8) and/or Section 30(1)(c) of the MACCA 2009 and/
or Section 32(2)(a) and/or Section 32(2)(c) of the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing And Proceeds of Unlawful
Activities Act 2001 (“AMLA 2001”) during the course of
investigations which have culminated into the subject matter of the
SRC Proceedings;

D

(ii) particulars of all books, documents, records, accounts or
computerised data or articles obtained pursuant to Section 30(1)(b)
of the MACCA 2009 or otherwise in the course of examinations
under Section 30(1)(a) and/or Section 30(8) of the MACCA 2009
or under a written statement on oath or affirmation made pursuant
to Section 30(1)(c) of the MACCA 2009 during the course of
investigations which have culminated into the subject matter of the
SRC Proceedings; and

E

(iii) particulars of any property, documents or information obtained
pursuant to Section 32(2)(b) AMLA 2001 during the course of
investigations which have culminated into the subject matter of the
Proceedings.

F

2(b) that the Prosecution do provide to the solicitors for the Applicant the
following on or before 11.1.2019 or a date to be fixed by this Honourable
Court:

G

(i) a List of Witnesses the prosecution intend to call during the case
for the prosecution in the SRC Proceedings together with the
proposed order of witnesses.
H

[7]

Hence the instant application before this court.

Essence Of The Contentions Of The Parties

I

[8]
The thrust of the applicant’s case is anchored on the primary
contention that the non-obstante clauses (Latin for “notwithstanding” clauses)
found in s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and s. 40 of the AMLATFA, given the
words therein, render the statements recorded and documents collected
during the course of investigations automatically admissible as evidence, at
the behest of either party to the proceedings in question.



100

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[9]
Crucially, the applicant then argued that given the automatic
admissibility, the operation of arts. 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution would
demand that copies of the said documents and statements must be supplied
by the respondent as the prosecution to the applicant as the accused before
the commencement of the trial.

A

[10] This is essentially the crux of the applicant’s case, which learned lead
counsel asserted is also supported by the operation of s. 62 of the MACC Act
and the very role of this court.

B

[11] The respondent, in its resistance to the application on the other hand
submitted that the applicant has misconstrued the application of the
non-obstante clauses found in s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and s. 40 of the
AMLATFA to exclude all other legislation or provisions in force in other
statutes particularly the Evidence Act 1950 which the respondent maintained
could not have been the intention of the Legislature. It was instead argued
by the respondent that these non-obstante clauses must be read subject to the
rules of privilege and the prohibition on the grounds of public policy.
[12] In addition, the respondent also disagreed with the approach to the
interpretation of arts. 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution adopted by the
applicant to support the latter’s argument that a prismatic interpretation of
these two articles would mean that the automatic admissibility of the
documents pursuant to the non-obstante clauses necessarily require disclosure
of copies of such documents by either side.

C

D

E

Evaluation And Findings By This Court
Whether The Non-obstante Clauses Exclude All Others
F

[13] The starting point must be the two statutory provisions. First, the
relevant parts of s. 30 of the MACC Act which read as follows:
30. Power to examine persons
(1) An officer of the Commission investigating an offence under this Act
may:

G

(a) order any person to attend before him for the purpose of being
examined orally in relation to any matter which may, in his opinion,
assist in the investigation into the offence;
(b) order any person, to produce before him, within the time specified
by such officer, any book, document, records, accounts or
computerised data, or any certified copy thereof, or any other article
which may, in his opinion, assist in the investigation into the
offence;
(c) by written notice order any person to furnish a statement in writing
made on oath or affirmation setting out therein all such information
which may be required under the notice, being information which,
in such officer’s opinion, would be of assistance in the investigation
into the offence, within the time specified by such officer; and

H

I



[2019] 5 CLJ
A

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

101

(d) order any person to attend before him for the purpose of having his
handwriting or voice sample taken.
...

B

C

(9) The record of an examination under paragraph (1)(a), or a written
statement on oath or affirmation made pursuant to paragraph 1(c), or any
book, document, record, account or computerised data, or article
produced under paragraph (1)(b) or otherwise in the course of an
examination under paragraph (1)(a), or under a written statement on oath
or affirmation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(c), or record of examination
of sample taken under paragraph (1)(d) shall, notwithstanding any
written law or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible in evidence in
any proceedings in any court:
(a) for an offence under this Act; or
(b) for the forfeiture of property pursuant to section 40 or 41,

D

regardless whether such proceedings are against the person who was
examined, or who produced the book, document, record, account or
computerised data, or article, or who made the written statement on oath
or affirmation, or against any other person.
(emphasis added)

E

[14]

Secondly, s. 40 of the AMLATFA which provides:

40. Statement to be admissible

G

The record of an examination under paragraph 32(2)(a), any property,
document or information produced under paragraph 32(2)(b) or any
statement under paragraph 32(2)(c) shall, notwithstanding any written
law or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible as evidence in any
proceedings in any court for, or in relation to, an offence or any other
matter under this Act or any offence under any other written law,
regardless whether such proceedings are against the person who was
examined, or who produced the property, document or information, or
who made the written statement on oath or affirmation, or against any
other person. (emphasis added)

H

[15] It is quite manifest that the operational parts of the aforementioned
statutory provisions state that any statements or documents obtained in the
course of investigations, notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to
the contrary, be admissible as evidence. This renders these clauses to be
classified as non-obstante clauses.

F

I

[16] And literally read, as statutes at the first instance should always be,
the objective appears to ensure that in respect of the admissibility of
documents and statements obtained under the MACC Act or the
AMLATFA, they shall be admissible as evidence without more; and this
also means there is absolutely no necessity to satisfy any conditions
precedent in order to render any evidence admissible before a court
proceeding.



102

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[17] The first question then is whether these non-obstante clauses truly have
the effect of excluding the rules on evidence. A literal reading of the
provisions suggests the affirmative, in support of the applicant’s stance.
Which, if true, means the operation of, inter alia, the Evidence Act 1950 in
respect of the rules on privilege or confidentiality in admitting as evidence
documents or statements obtained under s. 30 of the MACC Act and s. 32
of the AMLATFA (on the power to examine persons) would be excluded.
[18] This literal approach found support in some case law authorities, such
as by the Federal Court in the case of PP v. Awaluddin Sham Bokhari [2018]
1 CLJ 305; [2017] 1 LNS 1701; [2018] 2 MLJ 401 which concerned the
non-obstante clause in the AMLATFA, where it was ruled that the statements
and documents exhibited to the investigating officer’s affidavit were
admissible, notwithstanding the rules against hearsay.
[19] A useful application of a non-obstante clause in the instant case can
perhaps be seen in the analysis of s. 134(4) of the Securities Commission
Malaysia Act 1993 (“the SCA”) which was recently examined by the Federal
Court in Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail [2016] 3 CLJ 19; [2016]
1 LNS 35; [2016] 1 MLJ 733. In that case, the accused had applied for
discovery of all statements made to and recorded by the investigating officer
of the Securities Commission in relation to its investigation against the
accused.

[20] The Federal Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and
disallowed the request for production of such statements. Section 134(4) of
the Securities Commission Malaysia Act 1993 states as follows:
134. Power to call for examination
(1) If an Investigating Officer of the Commission carrying out an
investigation under any securities law suspects or believes on reasonable
grounds that any person can give information relevant to a matter that
he is investigating, the Investigating Officer of the Commission may by
notice in writing to such person require such person:

F

G

(a) to give to the Investigating Officer of the Commission all reasonable
assistance in connection with the investigation; and
(b) to appear before a specified Investigating Officer of the Commission
or specified Investigating Officers of the Commission to be
examined orally.

H

(1A) An Investigating Officer of the Commission exercising his authority
under paragraph (1)(b) shall reduce into writing any statement made by
the person examined under subsection (1).
(2) A person referred to in subsection (1) shall be legally bound to answer
all questions relating to such case put to him by the Investigating Officer
of the Commission and to state the truth, whether or not the statement
is made wholly or partly in answer to questions, and shall not refuse to
answer any question on the ground that it tends to incriminate him.

[21] The crux of the Federal Court decision in Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk
Ishak Ismail may be said to be encapsulated in the following passage of the
judgment of Ahmad Maarop CJ (Malaya) (as he then was):
[32] In other words, the provision under section 134(4) of the SCA must
be read subject to the rules of privilege and prohibition on the grounds
of public policy. In our view, this applies to civil as well as criminal
proceedings. In the context of the present appeal, the relevant and
applicable rules for consideration are housed in sections 123 and 124 of
the Evidence Act 1950.

[22] Thus even though s. 134(4) makes all such statements taken in the
course of investigation to be admissible regardless, the Federal Court read
into that s. 134(4) the qualification that such admissibility must be subject
to ss. 123 and 124 of the Evidence Act 1950 which according to the Federal
Court, were held to codify the rules of the law of privilege and public policy
against disclosure of investigation statements.
[23] However - and this is crucial - as highlighted by the lead counsel for
the applicant, the instant application stands in stark contrast to the situation
encountered in Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail in one material
respect; probably the most important aspect, which is this - the non-obstante
clause. Which s. 134(4) of the SCA is strictly however not one. In
contradistinction, s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and s. 40 of the AMLATFA
patently feature the non-obstante clause given the language starting from
“Notwithstanding ...”
[24] There is on the other hand a line of authorities which suggests that
where the non-obstante clause refers generally without stating the specific
provision or statute to be overridden, it is not permissible to exclude per se
all other legislation or provisions in force in other statutes. In other words,
absent very specific words of the exact rules or laws to be excluded, no such
automatic displacement can be made effective.
[25] The extent of such intended exclusion must be worked out from a
further examination of the true objective and remit underlying the provisions
where the non-obstante clause is adopted. As such, only if there arises a
conflict between the specific statutory objective behind that provision and
such other law on the same subject, would the other law be held to be
excluded from being operative.

[26] Thus, in Ho Tack Sien & Ors v. Rotta Research Laboratorium S.p.A
& Anor; Registrar Of Trade Marks (Intervener) & Another Appeal [2015] 4 CLJ
20; [2015] 4 MLJ 166, Zulkefli CJ (Malaya) (as he then was), in delivering
the judgment of the Federal Court which had examined certain provisions of
the Trade Marks Act 1976, held instructively as follows:

A

[38] We also noted that one of the grounds relied on by the Court of
Appeal to suggest the wrongful exercise of discretion by the High Court
was the reliance on s. 40(1)(f) of the Act. The Court of Appeal disagreed
with the previous decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinma Medical Products
(M) Sdn Bhd v. Yomeishu Seizo Co Ltd & Ors [2004] 3 CLJ 815; [2004] 4 MLJ
358 on the application of the said section and instead held it as a further
ground on which the registrar should be heard. Section 40(1)(f) of the Act
provides as follows:

B

C

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the following acts
do not constitute an infringement of a trademark:
(f) the use of a trademark, which is one of two or more
registered trademarks which are substantially identical, in
exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by
registration as provided by this Act. (emphasis added.)
[39] Although s. 40(1) of the Act begins with the words ‘notwithstanding
...’. it is a general principle that a non-obstante clause cannot go outside the
limits of the Act itself. We are in agreement with the contention of the
plaintiff that non-obstante clause is subject to the limitations contained in
the section and cannot be read as excluding the whole Act and standing
by itself. The principle was stated by the Indian Supreme Court in AG
Varadarajulu & Anor v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors AIR 1998 SC 1388 at para
[16] as follows:
It is well settled that while dealing with a non-obstante clause under which
the legislature wants to give overriding effect to a section, the Court must try
to find out the extent to which the legislature had intended to give one
provision overriding effect over another provision. Such intention of the
legislature in this behalf is to be gathered from the enacting part
of the section. In Aswini Kumar v. Arbinda Bose AIR 1952 SC 369,
Patanjali Sastri J observed: The enacting part of a statute must,
where it is clear, be taken to control the non-obstante clause where
both cannot be read harmoniously.’ In Madhav Rao Scindia v. Union
of India [1971] 1 SCC 85 (at 139): (AIR 1971 SC 530 Hidayatullah,
CJ observed that the non-obstante clause is no doubt a very potent
clause intended to exclude every consideration arising from other
provisions of the same statute or other statute but for that reason
alone we must determine the scope of that provision strictly. When
the section containing the said clause does not refer to any particular
provisions which it intends to override but refers to the provisions of the statute
generally, it is not permissible to hold that it excludes the whole Act and
stands all alone by itself. A search has, therefore, to be made with a view
to determining which provisions answers the description and which does not.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

105

[40] Accordingly, it is our view that s. 40(1)(f) of the Act only applies to
a right to use a mark that has been duly registered under the Act. It is
therefore tied to s. 35(1) of the Act which governs the rights given by
registration. It reads:
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the registration of a person
... as registered proprietor of a trade mark (other than a certification
trade mark) in respect of any goods or services shall, if valid, give
or be deemed to have been given to that person the exclusive right
to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services
subject to any conditions, amendments, modifications or
limitations entered in the Register. (emphasis added.)

[27] The applicant has not clearly made out a case as to the extent to which
the Legislature had intended to give the relevant non-obstante clauses
overriding effect over all other rules and legal provisions. In any event, in
my view, the weight of authorities on the subject, particularly these two
fairly recent Federal Court decisions in Suruhanjaya Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak
Ismail - which subject the admissibility to the rules of evidence - and Ho Tack
Sien & Ors v. Rotta Research Laboratorium SPA - which requires specific
identification of the rules to be excluded - provides a valid and compelling
basis not to subscribe to the proposition advanced by the applicant that the
non-obstante clauses in the instant case would have the effect of, without
more, automatically rendering the statements and documents admissible
obtained by MACC as evidence in any proceeding.
In Any Event, Automatic Admissibility Does Not Equate To The Right To Inspect

F

G

H

I

[28] I would further take the view that even if the construction ascribed to
the non-obstante clauses by the applicant was accurate, where the documents
and statements obtained during the investigations are admissible as of right,
the applicant has not satisfactorily established whether their pre-trial
production to the applicant as the accused must necessarily follow. In this
regard, the premise justifying the leap from automatic admissibility of the
statements and documents to the production of such statements and
documents has not been clearly established.
[29] When queried at the hearing, the counsel for the applicant argued
more at the theoretical if not conceptual level. In that, admissibility must
also be taken to mean that both the prosecution and the defence be given
equal opportunity in deciding whether to admit the said evidence or
otherwise, relying among others on the following observation of Lord
Mustill in Re D (Minors) (Adoption Reports: Confidentiality) [1996] AC 593:
(the) first principle of fairness (is) that each party to a judicial process
should have an opportunity to answer by evidence and by argument any
adverse material that the tribunal may take into account when forming its
opinion.



Current Law Journal

106

[2019] 5 CLJ

[30] The applicant essentially propagates the familiar argument on the
equality of arms principle that the applicant as the accused would be at a
considerable disadvantage if he is not afforded the opportunity to view those
documents and statements in the first place, unlike the situation enjoyed by
the prosecution. These arguments are not new. They are even not without
merits.
[31] The applicant further augmented his argument by drawing in support
the provisions of arts. 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution which according
to the applicant demand that copies of the said documents and statements
must be provided to the applicant before the commencement of the trial in
order to enable him to prepare his defence effectively.
[32]

A

B

C

Article 5(1) states:

5. Liberty of the person
(1) No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in
accordance with law.

[33]

D

And art. 8(1) reads:

8. Equality
(1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal
protection of the law.

[34] However, as is well-settled, the fundamental liberties embodied in
art. 5 by its very words are not absolute (see the High Court case of
S Kulasingam & Anor v. Commissioner of Lands, Federal Territory & Ors
[1982] CLJ 65; [1982] CLJ (Rep) 314; [1982] 1 MLJ 204). Neither is the
principle of equality in art. 8 immutably entrenched (see the Federal Court
decision in PP v. Datuk Harun Hj Idris & Ors [1976] 1 LNS 180; [1976] 2 MLJ
116).
[35] On this latter point, I cannot but agree with the assertion by the
respondent that the applicant has not demonstrated how he is discriminated
against, compared to other persons who are similarly under investigation by
the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission under the MACC Act.
[36] It is undeniable that other countries may well have introduced
procedures that reflect greater adherence to the equality of arms principle.
The applicant has identified a number of case law authorities from other even
beyond Commonwealth jurisdictions to support his contention. Just to refer
to one such case, is the pronouncement of the European Court of Human
Rights in the case of Fitt v. United Kingdom [2000] ECHR 29777/96 which
held:
It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal
proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to
procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms
between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial
means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be

given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the
observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see the
Brandstetter v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no, 211,
paras 66, 67). In addition Article 6(1) requires, as indeed does English law
(see para. 18 above), that the prosecution authorities should disclose to
the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the
accused (see the above-mentioned Edwards judgment, para. 36)

[37] The point is well taken. But that is the position in other countries. At
best, these are merely of persuasive authority. Neither can it be denied
however that Malaysia too has seen a fundamental progress in the promotion
of the equality of arms principle by the introduction of s. 51A of the CPC
which now reads as follows:
51A. Delivery of certain documents
(1) The prosecution shall before the commencement of the trial deliver to
the accused the following documents:

D

(a) a copy of the information made under section 107 relating to the
commission of the offence to which the accused is charged, if any;
(b) a copy of any document which would be tendered as part of the
evidence for the prosecution; and

E

(c) a written statement of facts favourable to the defence of the
accused signed under the hand of the Public Prosecutor or any
person conducting the prosecution.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), the prosecution may not supply any
fact favourable to the accused if its supply would be contrary to public
interest.

F

G

(3) A document shall not be inadmissible in evidence merely because of
non-compliance with subsection (1).
(4) The Court may exclude any document delivered after the
commencement of the trial if it is shown that such delivery was so done
deliberately and in bad faith.
(5) Where a document is delivered to the accused after the
commencement of the trial, the Court shall allow the accused:
(a) a reasonable time to examine the document; and

H

I

(b) to recall or re-summon and examine any witness in relation to the
document.

[38] However, any further development must await legislative
interventions, just as was the case for s. 51A concerning its introduction in
the first place and its subsequent amendments (further discussion on s. 51A
below). This simply cannot, as suggested by the applicant, be achieved by
a mere and purported prismatic construction of the constitutional
prescriptions as per Lee Kwan Who v. PP [2009] 5 CLJ 631 vis-à-vis the
relevant non-obstante clauses in the MACC Act and AMLATFA.



Current Law Journal

108

[2019] 5 CLJ

[39] In fact, as correctly submitted by the respondent, even in the
authorities cited by the applicant, some of the judicial observations reflect a
certain degree of reservation against unbridled access by the accused. Thus
the South Africa Constitutional Court in the case referred to by the counsel
for the applicant himself, namely Shabalala v. A-G of the Transvaal and Another
[1996] 1 LRC 207 actually stated the following:
[5] The state is entitled to resist a claim by the accused for access to any
particular document in the police docket on the grounds that such access
is not justified for the purposes of enabling the accused properly to
exercise his or her right to a fair trial or on the ground that it has reason
to believe that there is a reasonable risk that access to the relevant
document would lead to the disclosure of the identity of an informer or
state secrets or on the grounds that there was a reasonable risk that such
disclosure might lead to the intimidation of witnesses or otherwise
prejudice the proper ends of justice.

[40] As such, despite the wordings in these non-obstante clauses, such
admissibility cannot in my judgment mean that the applicant is entitled to the
statements and documents applied for, and defeat considerations on claims
of privilege and public policy against such production of the said documents
and statements.
Section 62 Of The MACC Act Does Not Assist The Applicant

A

B

C

D

E

[41] The applicant then raises the important argument about that unique
provision of s. 62 of the MACC Act. It reads as follows:
62. Defence statement
Once delivery of documents by the prosecution pursuant to section 51A
of the Criminal Procedure Code has taken place, the accused shall, before
commencement of the trial, deliver the following documents to the
prosecution:
(a) a defence statement setting out in general terms the nature of the
defence and the matters on which the accused takes issue with the
prosecution, with reasons; and

F

G

(b) a copy of any document which would be tendered as part of the
evidence for the defence.

[42] This provision imposes on the applicant, as the accused the obligation
to disclose the above matters to the prosecution upon the latter’s adherence
to s. 51A of the CPC.
[43] The applicant submitted orally and in writing that documents
delivered to the defence under s. 51A necessarily are a subset of the
documents obtained during the course of investigation, which I cannot
disagree. But the applicant further asserted that these are admissible as of
right, and which admission, should be at the prerogative of both parties.

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

109

[44] This, I think, is quite misconceived. The applicant continued to adopt
this line of reasoning which I find unsustainable. This is because, as I have
stated earlier, even if these documents are automatically admissible, it does
not follow, as night follows day, that they can and should be inspected by
or delivered to the applicant as of right. If the applicant’s argument were
accurate, there is no necessity for Parliament to make MACC Act rely on
s. 51A in s. 62 of the MACC Act in the first place.
[45] The law in this country in respect of criminal pre-trial disclosure has
seen incremental but significant amendments. Section 51A of CPC was a
very significant introduction to the corpus of our law on criminal procedure.
Section 62 of the MACC Act is no less important in that context. The
applicant in its written submission probably aptly described s. 62 as:
a unique departure from the general law in its approach to pre-trial
disclosure. The only reasonable view to take of Section 62 of the MACCA
2009 is as progressive piece of legislation, a flare in the dark by the
legislature, which brings us closer to the equality of arms principle.

[46] I cannot agree more. And at the same time, it reinforces the point that
what was submitted by the applicant to be the law demanding disclosure
cannot be sustained in the absence of clear legislative prescriptions to such
effect. But other than s. 51A of the CPC and s. 62 of the MACC Act, no other
provisions exist. Automatic disclosure plainly cannot be founded on the
non-obstante clauses.
[47] Yet the applicant contended that s. 51A of the CPC is “woefully
inadequate to meet the defence halfway, so to speak”, and urged this court
to instead give full effect to the rule of law in this regard.
[48] This, however, this court cannot do. It is not for the courts to make
laws. It is so trite there is no need to mention even an authority to support
this fundamental principle. The court will however continue to ensure justice
and fair play are strictly upheld throughout the proceedings involving the
applicant, as equally it would always for others, within the framework of the
existing rules on disclosure.
[49] Furthermore, both s. 51A of the CPC and s. 62 of the MACC Act are
not concerned with the issue of admissibility. As such, failure to adhere to
these disclosure obligations does not affect admissibility simply because they
do not form a substantive due process but instead constitute only procedural
requirements. The statutory provision is procedural and not evidential
(see the High Court decision in PP v. Mohd Fazil Awaludin [2009] 2 CLJ 862).
[50] Indeed, sub-s. (3) of s. 51A (as were sub-ss. (4) and (5)) which was
introduced by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 2012 makes
it crystal clear that non-compliance with the obligation to deliver the
requisite documents stated in sub-s. (1) does not render them inadmissible in
evidence.



110

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[51] And as correctly stated by the respondent, these provisions certainly
have nothing to do with the duty on the part of the prosecution to prove a
prima facie case prior to the accused being called to enter his defence; and
neither does it remove the need for the prosecution to prove its case beyond
a reasonable doubt at the end of the entire case.

A

[52] The MACC Act for instance, despite the interpretation of ready
admissibility ascribed to s. 30 therein by the applicant, expressly in s. 62
refers to s. 51A of the CPC as governing statements under MACC Act as
well. Section 62 goes further and compels the production of documents
intended to be relied on by the defence to the prosecution.

B

[53] The point is this. If automatic admissibility is true, such that it would
not have been necessary to enact any express provisions on production, in
my judgment it would not have been necessary for the MACC Act to enact
s. 62 in the first place.
[54] The fact that s. 62 exists supports the view that production does not
necessarily follow from the admissibility of all such statements and
documents. More crucially the ‘production must necessarily result from the
admissibility’ argument cannot also be sustained because the very s. 62 of the
MACC which concerns production makes it crystal clear that the law
governing pre-trial production of documents by the prosecution under the
MACC Act is s. 51A of the CPC.
[55] Section 62 reinforces the law on s. 51A of the CPC, and in the absence
of provisions similar to ss. 51 and 51A of the CPC in the MACC Act or in
the AMLATFA, the jurisprudence on these two provisions of the CPC would
therefore also govern rules on production of statements and documents under
the MACC Act and the AMLATFA.

C

D

E

F

[56] This is further supported by the provisions of s. 3 of the CPC which
states as follows:
3. Trial of offences under Penal Code and other laws

G

All offences under the Penal Code shall be inquired into and tried
according to the provisions hereinafter contained, and all offences under
any other law shall be inquired into and tried according to the same
provisions; subject however to any written law for the time being in force
regulating the manner or place of inquiring into and trying such offences.

[57] As such offences under MACC Act and AMLATFA are pursuant to
this s. 3 of the CPC to be tried according to the CPC since there are no
specific provisions in those two statutes that regulate production of
documents as contained in ss. 51 and 51A of the CPC.
[58] The accused said, he must be given the right to review admissible
evidence in order to ensure that any exculpatory admissible evidence,
whether in the form of recorded statements or documents in the possession
of the prosecution is identified, and thus to consider whether to exercise the

H

A

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

111

right on whether to admit the same at any juncture of the trial. The court,
according to the applicant, is compelled to admit the same once a party has
moved for the document to be admitted.
[59]

This proposition therefore does not reflect the state of the law.

B

Jurisprudence Of Section 51 Too Does Not Assist The Applicant

C

[60] As reliance cannot be had to the non-obstante clauses to warrant
production of the documents requested for by the applicant, this instant
application by the applicant can therefore only instead be premised on s. 51
of the CPC which empowers the court to compel any person to produce any
document or thing which is necessary in a trial or a judicial proceeding.
[61]

Section 51 provides the following:

51. Summons to produce document or other things
D

E

(1) Whenever any Court or police officer making a police investigation
considers that the production of any property or document is necessary
or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other
proceeding under this Code by or before that Court or officer, such Court
may issue a summons or such officer a written order to the person in
whose possession or power such property or document is believed to be
requiring him to attend and produce it or to produce it at the time and
place stated in the summons or order.
(2) Any person required under this section merely to produce any property
or document shall be deemed to have complied with the requisition if he
causes the property or document to be produced instead of attending
personally to produce the same.

F

G

H

I

(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any
law relating to evidence for the time being in force or to apply to any
postal article, telegram or other document in the custody of the postal or
telegraph authorities.

[62] The jurisprudence on s. 51 is fairly settled. In the first place, s. 51
should be construed strictly because its purpose is to provide limited access
and its scope fairly restricted. It cannot be invoked to justify full disclosure
of the prosecution’s case.
[63] In the case of Syed Abu Bakar Ahmad v. PP [1981] 1 LNS 127; [1982]
2 MLJ 186, the High Court ruled thus:
In my opinion, this section ought to be construed strictly. It does not
allow an accused to ask for discovery of documents or inspection of
documents seized by the Police in the course of their investigation or in
their possession before the criminal trial. To do so would be tantamount
to inspection of the evidence of the prosecution by the defence prior to
the trial. I regret I am unable to agree with the learned judge if the order
meant that the defence is entitled to inspect the documents seized by the
police or in their possession before the criminal trial.

[64] The leading authority on this subject however is the Federal Court
decision in PP v. Raymond Chia Kim Chwee & Anor & Another Case [1985]
2 CLJ 457; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 260; [1985] 2 MLJ 436. The decision in
Raymond Chia was followed by the Federal Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim
v. PP [2010] 4 CLJ 265; [2010] 2 MLJ 312.

A

[65] In the former, Hashim Yeop A Sani SCJ, for the Federal Court laid
down the legal position in the following terms:

B

Where the Court is asked to exercise its discretion under section 51 of
the Criminal Procedure Code before the commencement of trial the Court
must have regard to the provisions of sections 152, 153 and 154 of the
Criminal Procedure Code relating to the framing of the charge. There is
clearly a specific duty imposed on the prosecution to particularise the
charge sufficiently so as to give adequate notice to the accused person.
The entitlement of the accused under section 51 of the Criminal
Procedure Code to any document or copies of document or other material
in the possession of the prosecution is entirely at the discretion of the
Court having regard to the justice of the case. The discretion should not
however be exercised so as to enable the accused to gain access to
materials before the trial as in the case of pre-trial discovery and inspection
of documents in a civil proceeding. The accused in a criminal trial should
have sufficient notice of what is alleged against him so as to enable him
to prepare his defence. So long as that requirement is satisfied the law is
satisfied.

C

D

E

...
Where the application under section 51(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code
is made in the course of the trial, the rule of relevancy must be strictly
enforced. We feel that this is what Mallal’s Criminal Procedure meant by
saying that “anything which may reasonably be regarded as forming part
of the evidence in the case may be ordered to be produced and that is
the primary object of these provisions.”
If the discretion is to be exercised before the commencement of trial the
Court cannot anticipate how the prosecution will proceed. In other words
the Court would not be justified to direct the prosecution to deliver to
the accused all documents taken from him for that will not be a correct
exercise of the discretion under section 51 of the Criminal Procedure
Code. In the first place the accused should know what documents had
been taken from him and to say that unless such documents were
delivered for his inspection he would not be able to adequately prepare
his defence cannot be a true proposition. A general demand for
unspecified documents should likewise not be entertained. See Anthony
Gomez v. Ketua Polis Daerah, Kuantan [1977] 2 MLJ 24 and Khoo Siew Bee
& Anor v. Ketua Polis Kuala Lumpur [1979] 2 MLJ 49 for another basis for
the inspection and supply of the first information report and cautioned
statement. Under section 51 of the Criminal Procedure Code the accused
is most certainly entitled to have copies of documents which are specified
in the charge. But the accused cannot be expected to be given access to

all documents whatsoever taken by the police during investigation. In
respect of application made in the course of the trial the materials or
documents asked for must be relevant to the issues for adjudication.

[66] These leading authorities and other cases established and reaffirmed,
among others, the following clear propositions of law.
B

C

D

E

F

G

H

I

[67] First, an application under s. 51 of the CPC must satisfy the
requirements of necessity and desirability stipulated in the s. 51 itself, and
that these would in turn depend on the stage of proceeding the application
is made.
[68] Secondly, where the application is made before the commencement of
trial, like in this case before me, the discovery must be limited to matters
that are specified in the charge. This is so because the justice of the case
would have been met if the applicant had been fully notified of the charge
against him. He cannot then be said to be at any disadvantage to prepare his
defence since at this stage, the defence is not yet a relevant consideration for
the court hearing the application.
[69] In Raymond Chia, the Federal Court held that where the court is asked
to exercise its discretion under s. 51 of the CPC for the supply of documents
and materials before the commencement of trial, just like in this case, the
court must have regard to the provisions of ss. 152, 153 and 154 of the CPC
relating to the framing of the charges.
[70] The prosecution therefore has a specific duty to ensure that the charges
are sufficiently particularised in order to give adequate notice to the accused.
Sufficient notice of the allegation fairly enables the accused to prepare his
defence.
[71] Where documents are referred to in the charge, the court will allow
copies of the documents be supplied to the accused. As such, I repeat that
regard should always be had to ss. 152, 153 and 154 of the CPC to ensure
the charges preferred against the accused are sufficiently particularised. To
permit the accused go beyond these particulars would be to provide the
accused with knowledge of the means by which the prosecution proposed to
prove the alleged facts. That is not allowed.
[72] I reiterate that the applicant is not requesting for documents which are
specified in any of the charges against him. I venture to add that those
documents, if any, may have been supplied under s. 51A of the CPC. In this
instant case before me, there is, at least thus far, no complaint about the
framing of the charges.
[73] Thirdly, the court is not and should not put itself in a position to
anticipate how the prosecution intends to conduct its case. In our criminal
justice system, that is fully within the prerogative of the prosecution.
Discovery before trial is therefore only permitted in respect of documents
specified in and related to the charge itself (see the High Court decision in
Tan Soon Geok v. PP & Anor (No 2) [2004] 8 CLJ 668).



114

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[74] This at the same time means that at this pre-trial stage, the applicant
should not therefore be heard to complain that his defence is going to be this
or that and that he requires access to such and such documents to prepare for
the defence. This is because at this stage, a roving and fishing inquiry for
evidence is manifestly not permitted. A catch-all net cannot be cast. The
applicant is simply not entitled to know by what means the prosecution
proposes to prove the facts underlying the charge against him. He should not,
because that firmly remains the prerogative of the prosecution.
[75] Fourthly, an accused cannot seek for the inspection or discovery of
documents or inspection of documents seized in the course of police
investigation since to do so would be tantamount to inspection of the
evidence of the prosecution by the defence. Section 51 simply cannot
authorise discovery to an accused of documents obtained in the course of
investigation. The applicant seems to be applying for precisely this type of
documents, for others under s. 51A have already, according to the
respondent, been delivered to him and his counsel.

D

[76] In Muzammil Izat Hashim v. PP [2003] 8 CLJ 399; [2003] 6 MLJ 590
it was reiterated by the High Court as follows:
Section 51 enables accused persons to apply for the production of
documents (see Public Prosecutor v. Teoh Choon Teck, Haji Abdul Ghani bin
Ishak v. Public Prosecutor [1980] 2 MLJ 196). It merely gives the applicant
the right of inspection and he has to make copies of the documents
himself (see Haji Abdul Ghani bin Ishak v. Public Prosecutor). In Syed Abu
Bakar bin Ahmad v. Public Prosecutor [1982] 2 MLJ 186 it was held that
s. 51 does not allow an accused to ask for discovery of documents or
inspection of documents seized by the police in the course of their
investigation since to do so would be tantamount to inspection of the
evidence of the prosecution by the defence prior to the trial. In Public
Prosecutor v. Raymond Chia Kim Chwee & Anor; Zainal bin Hj Ali v. Public
Prosecutor [1985] 2 MLJ 436 it was held that in exercising the discretion
under s. 51 the court will have to consider the justice of the case and the
stage of the proceedings the application is made.

[77] Fifthly, it is worthy of emphasis that the entitlement of the accused
under s. 51 of the CPC to any document or copies of documents or other
material in the possession of the prosecution is entirely at the discretion of
the court having regard to the justice of the case. The discretion should not
however be exercised so as to enable the accused to gain access to materials
before the trial as in the case of pre-trial discovery and inspection of
documents in a civil proceeding.
[78] Sixthly, like presently, where an application is made before
commencement of the inquiry or trial, the general rule is that the request
must be directed at a specific document. A general direction to produce all
papers relating to the subject in dispute will not be enforced (see PP v. Teoh
Choon Teck [1962] 1 LNS 141; [1963] 1 MLJ 34).

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak v. PP

[79] In the instant case, the applicant is asking for all statements recorded
by the MACC and other documents taken by them in the course of
investigation. The type of document is identified, but the exact document is
not specified. This further weakens the case of the applicant.
[80] Seventhly, the Federal Court in Raymond Chia also held that if the
application is made during the trial, the accused would be entitled to
discovery if the documents satisfy the test of relevancy and essential for
adjudication based on the evidence before the court. However, the instant
application before this court concerns the stage before commencement of
trial.
[81] In the present application before me, the applicant seeks two principal
types of information from the respondent as described in prayer 1(g), (h), (i),
(j) and prayer 2(i) of his notice of motion. First, statements given by potential
witnesses to the MACC and secondly, other documents obtained by the
MACC under the relevant provisions compelling production embodied in
the MACC Act and the AMLATFA in the course of its investigation
pertaining to the charges against the applicant.
[82] It is observed that the other prayers in the notice of motion are no
longer relevant as they concerned statements and documents taken from the
applicant himself, which according to the respondent, as affirmed in the
relevant affidavit have thus far all been supplied to the applicant in
compliance with s. 51A of the CPC.
[83] The law governing the supply of such statements to an accused before
trial, as stated in Husdi v. PP [1980] 1 LNS 33; [1979] 2 MLJ 304 is free from
ambiguity. An accused is not entitled to copies of police statements recorded
from witnesses in the course of investigations. First, a statement taken from
a witness is a privileged document. Secondly as a matter of public policy,
it is not desirable for the prosecution to provide the accused with such
statements as there is a real danger of tampering with witnesses.
[84] In that case, the accused applied for copies of the cautioned statement
made by the accused and of statements made by prosecution witnesses during
investigations. Syed Othman FJ, sitting in the High Court, allowed a copy
of the cautioned statement to be supplied to the accused but not the
statements of prosecution witnesses, holding that there might be tampering
of witnesses.
[85]

The High Court held thus:

Considering the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code and the
Evidence Act, I can find no provision which is construable as giving a right
to inspect a police statement.
I

To go further, there is Bryant and Dickson (1946) 31 Cr App 146 151.
Towards the end of his judgment in Khoo Siew Bee & Anor v. Ketua Polis,
Kuala Lumpur supra, Suffian L.P. said:



Current Law Journal

116

[2019] 5 CLJ

Be it noted that my ruling only applies to statements recorded from
the accused, not from others who are potential witnesses against
or for them - as to which the prosecution is under no duty to
supply to the defence, Bryant and Dickson.

A

So far as applicable to the present case, the principle that appears to be
laid down in this case is that it is the function of the prosecution and the
defence to prepare their own case; but the defence is not entitled to the
police statement, as they themselves may record a statement from a
prosecution witness if they so desire. The last part is merely a reiteration
of the principle that there is no property to a witness - not to a document
generally, as attempted to be extended by the petitioner’s side.

B

...

In India, the law relating to the powers of the police in investigation is
about the same as ours. But it should be noted that in the Indian Criminal
Procedure Code there is no provision equivalent to our section 112(iii)
which in effect says that a person making a police statement shall be
legally bound to state the truth. Sohoni’s the Code of Criminal Procedure
(16th Edition) Volume 1, at page 796 reads:
‘A refusal to answer questions asked by a police officer under this
section’ (section 161) ‘is not punishable under section 176, section
179 or section 187, I.P.C., as under the present Code’ (1898) ‘there
is no obligation to speak the truth as there was under the 1882
Code’.

C

D

E

It was decided there in Methuram Dass v. Jagannath Dass ILR 28 Cal 794
that a statement made in the course of police investigation was absolutely
privileged. At page 797 the court said:
‘In the Present case the investigation was required by law; it was
conducted under the provisions of the law, it was ancillary to the
administration of justice. The defendant was bound by law to
answer all questions put to him by the police officer conducting the
investigation, and was punishable if he answered untruly and what
was said by him had reference to the matter under investigation.
Virtually the only distinction between his position and that of an
ordinary witness arises from the fact that his statement was not
made in a court of justice, and we see no reason accordingly, to
use the language of the Lord Chief Baron cited above,’ - that was
in the case of Dawkins v. Lord Rokeby (1875) LR 7 HL 744 - ‘why
public policy should not equally prevent an action being brought
against him as against a witness in an ordinary court of justice’.
What should be noted in the above passage is that part of the first
sentence which says that the investigation was required by law, i.e. written
law. This covers the act of recording a police statement. But it should be
observed that the statement that it was punishable if a person making a
police statement answered untruly, appears to be in conflict with the
provisions of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code in force at the time.
This case was decided in 1901, when under the 1898 Indian Code there

117

is no obligation to speak the truth to the police as indicated by Sohoni
and cited above. But, for the purpose of the present case, we are only
concerned with the ruling that a police statement is a privileged document.
The Court of Appeal here has followed the Indian decision. In Martin
Rhienus v. Sher Singh [1949] MLJ 201 Willan C.J. after citing the above
passage at page 203 said:

B

I agree with that decision and the reasoning for it.
The question was raised by the court whether the provisions of
section 113 of the Criminal Procedure Code prevent a statement
made under section 112 from being given in evidence at all, even
in civil proceedings, but having decided that statements made
under section 112 are absolutely privileged it is not necessary for
me to decide this further question. Nor, having found that the
statement in this case was made under section 112 it is necessary
to decide whether information to the police under section 107 is,
or is not, absolutely privileged.

C

D

E

These two cases involve actions for defamation. But I am of the view that
once a police statement is held to be absolutely privileged for one judicial
purpose, it is privileged for other purposes. There can be no right to
inspect. Further, as a matter of public policy, I am of the view that it is
undesirable for the prosecution to supply the defence with police
statements, as there is a real danger of tampering with the witnesses.

[86] The Federal Court, in the judgment of Suffian LP in Husdi v. PP [1980]
1 LNS 29; [1980] 2 MLJ 80, affirmed this decision which also primarily
ruled that during trial, the accused is entitled to a copy of the statement by
a prosecution witness for purposes of impeachment.
F

G

H

I

[87]

It was authoritatively thus held:

We do not think that the prosecution should supply copies of the police
statement direct to the defence without the intervention of the court because of the peculiar circumstances prevailing in this country. Malaysia
is a small country, with a small population, and Malaysians are easily
scared; they are reluctant to be involved. If a crime is committed under
their nose they look the other way, see, hear and say nothing, do little
or nothing to help identify - let alone - arrest the offender, and yet
complain that the police do not catch criminals and that courts are
bedazzled by technicalities. If the prosecution is obliged to supply copies
of police statements to the defence without the intervention of the court,
the defence may be tempted to ask for, and the prosecution will be obliged
to supply, copies of every statement in the police investigation file, and
Malaysians will be more reluctant to come forward with evidence to
incriminate their fellows.
To sum up, the answer to the two questions as limited during the course
of arguments is this - when a prosecution witness is being cross-examined,
and the defence proposes to impeach his credit, the court, should, on the
request of the defence, refer to his police statement and may then, if the
court thinks it expedient in the interest of justice, direct the defence to
be supplied with a copy.

[2019] 5 CLJ

Our conclusion is not inconsistent with judgment of Syed Othman F.J.
in Husdi v. Public Prosecutor [1979] 2 MLJ 304 out of which arises this
reference, which dealt with the wider question whether or not the defence
is entitled in advance of the trial to copies of police statements of
prosecution witnesses, and which he answered in the negative, which
answer was not challenged before us.

A

B

[88] Thus the key request of the applicant herein for copies of the
statements made by other persons to the MACC cannot be sustained. The
application absolutely fails the test of necessity and desirability in s. 51 of
the CPC.
[89] As for the other documents secured by the MACC in its investigation,
the decision of the High Court in Syed Abu Bakar Ahmad v. PP [1981] 1 LNS
127; [1982] 2 MLJ 186 is no less instructive, where the application by the
accused to inspect and make copies of all documents in the possession of the
prosecution by reason that the defence would not otherwise be able to
prepare the defence adequately was refused by Seah J (as he then was) who
also ruled that s. 51 of the CPC should be construed strictly and that it did
not allow discovery of documents seized by police before the trial.
[90] In the event the document tendered as evidence is complicated in
nature, His Lordship ruled that it would be open to the accused to ask for
time to stand down before cross-examination.
[91] Again, in the case before me, the applicant too is asking to be supplied
with other documents obtained by the exercise of the coercive powers of the
MACC under the MACC Act and the AMLATFA. This, however, cannot
succeed as it would amount to discovery of the documents seized by the
investigation team of the MACC in the course of its investigation. Thus,
again, given the clear position in law, the proposed supply of such documents
similarly can be neither necessary nor desirable within the context of s. 51
of the CPC. The application cannot succeed.
[92] The applicant makes the argument that Husdi v. PP does not apply
because it was based on statement recorded under s. 112 of the CPC, not
pursuant to MACC Act or the AMLATFA. Also s. 112 then rendered
statements made by a person to a police officer inadmissible. In contrast, the
investigation in the instant case relied heavily on the MACC Act and
AMLATFA.
[93] And that by virtue of the non-obstante clauses in s. 30(9) of the MACC
Act and s. 40 of AMLATFA which plainly and expressly supersede any
‘rule of law the contrary’ as stated therein, it should, at the risk of repetition,
follow that the application of the privileged document principle derived from
authorities such as Husdi v. PP would be a non-starter.
[94] In other words, the statements recorded under s. 30 of the MACC Act
and s. 40 of AMLATFA are admissible regardless of any rule of law relating
to privilege.

[95] Separately, s. 124 of the Evidence Act 1950 also provides that a public
officer shall not be compelled to disclose ‘communications’ made to ‘him’
in ‘official confidence’, when he considers that the public interest would
suffer by the disclosure. These non-obstante clauses which render the
recorded statements admissible in evidence in this case, expressly supersede
‘any written law ... to the contrary’.
[96] This, according to the applicant, must therefore supersede s. 124 of the
Evidence Act 1950. As such, no public officer, such as an officer involved
in the investigations under MACC Act and the AMLATFA can claim any
privilege under s. 124 if asked to testify on the contents of any oral
examination or produce recorded statement or a written statement on oath
signed by a witness.
[97] Any arguments concerning privilege under the Evidence Act 1950
would be an exercise in futility. Further, statements recorded by the
investigators of the MACC under s. 30 of the MACC Act are not
“communications” made in “official confidence”. The applicant further
argued that in any event, the respondent did not in its affidavit resisting this
application aver that the recorded statements were given to a public officer
in “official confidence”, or that disclosure of such statements would affect
the public interest, or even that any privilege applied.
[98] Significantly, the applicant also contended that the ‘threat’ or ‘risk’ of
witness tampering is raised for the first time by the respondent in its
submissions. There is, according to the applicant, absolutely no credible
affidavit evidence showing such a risk or threat.
[99] In essence, the decisions of the Federal Court and High Court in Husdi
v. PP, and subsequent decided cases on the matter, are, according to the
applicant, not applicable to the present criminal application and as such.
there should be no bars to disclosure of documents, and that public policy
justifying non-disclosure of the documents and statements based on a risk of
witness tampering is similarly not applicable to the present criminal
application.
[100] This contention of the applicant is not unattractive. But it is
misconceived for the reasons I have stated earlier. That is even if the
non-obstante clauses in question had the effect of rendering those statements
and documents automatically admissible regardless of the rules of evidence
and public policy, it does not follow that the applicant as the accused is
entitled to those in the possession of the prosecution before trial, given the
clear absence of any legislative provisions giving authorisation to such effect.
Section 51A Too Does Not Support The Case Of The Applicant

I

[101] It cannot be emphasised enough that s. 51A of the CPC which first
came into force in 2007 is a very significant provision which seeks to
promote fair trial. Abdull Hamid Embong FCJ, delivering the judgment of
the Federal Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2010] 4 CLJ 265;
[2010] 2 MLJ 312 said this of s. 51A of the CPC:



120

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

In our view, this new provision strengthens the guarantee of a fair trial
in providing the adequate facilities as purported in the general remarks
document of the Human Rights Committee that was read to us. Section
51A of the CPC has, in our opinion, made the battlefield move level, to
preserve the ‘equality of arms principle’, ensure the fairness of a trial and
ultimately uphold the very integrity of the courts in its administration of
criminal justice. This should also be considered in the light of our criminal
justice system where the burden of proof lies throughout on the
prosecution, which, together with the common law principle of
presumption of innocence, safeguard that fairness.

[102] Section 51A promotes fair trial by compelling the prosecution to
deliver to an accused before commencement of trial all documents that the
prosecution intend to tender as part of the evidence for the prosecution. In
addition, the prosecution must also provide to the accused before trial a
written statement of facts favourable to the defence of the accused. This too,
according to the respondent has been complied with by the prosecution in
this case.
[103] Now the applicant seeks to be supplied with statements and documents
which are not taken from the applicant. In other words, the applicant is
seeking to inspect statements and documents procured and obtained by the
MACC in the course of investigation which the prosecution does not intend
to tender to prove the charges against the applicant. These are the unused
documents of the prosecution.
[104] Under present law, therefore, all documents intended to be tendered
by the prosecution must be given to the accused before trial. And in this case
before me, as stated earlier, the respondent has affirmed that s. 51A has been
adhered to. The potential for a trial by ambush has been much minimised
by the said compliance more so in criminal trials involving commercial
crimes like the charges now faced by the applicant where evidence would
most likely be largely documents-based.
[105] Furthermore, the respondent has also affirmed that it has given a
written statement that there are no facts favourable to the accused in
compliance with s. 51A(1)(c). In other words, the prosecution is also
asserting that the unused documents, or the other documents and statements
which are not proposed to be tendered to prove its case but now required by
the applicant, do not disclose any facts that can assist the defence. This
further weakens the case for the applicant for discovery of those statements
and documents.
[106] In any event it was also held by the Court of Appeal in PP v. Dato’ Seri
Anwar Ibrahim & Another Appeal [2010] 4 CLJ 331 that the accuracy of the
prosecution’s specific assertion under s. 51A on this absence of facts
favourable to the accused would only be an issue after the commencement
of trial where the matter could be determined by the court after evidence has
been given by the relevant witnesses. Again, this is but a manifestation of the
rule that the court cannot anticipate how the prosecution would prove its
case.

[107] In that appeal, Hasan Lah JCA (as he then was) held as follows:
[66] With regard to the learned judge’s observation that the defence be
supplied with the witnesses’ statements so that the defence could find out
whether what was said by the prosecution pursuant to s. 51A(1)(c) was
right or not we were of the view that the issue could only be determined
by the court after the commencement of the trial and after the relevant
witnesses have given evidence in court. The court could not anticipate
how the prosecution would prove its case.

[108] This Court of Appeal decision on ss. 51 and 51A of the CPC was
affirmed by the Federal Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP [2010] 4 CLJ
265; [2010] 2 MLJ 312, referred to earlier.
[109] It is important to note that the leading authority of Raymond Chia was
decided before s. 51A was introduced in 2007. In fact many of the case law
authorities on the subject, which restricted the right of the accused to
discovery of documents before trial, pre-date the introduction of s. 51A.

D

[110] With the introduction of s. 51A, which compels the prosecution to
deliver before trial all documents intended to be tendered, the rationale for
further pre-trial discovery under s. 51 has thus been made even more
tenuous, if not entirely untenable apart from those referred to in the charges,
as mentioned earlier.

[111] It is worthy of emphasis that although these statutory provisions in
s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and s. 40 of the anti-money laundering legislation
or these non-obstante clauses arguably render statements recorded from
persons and documents produced in the course of investigation admissible in
evidence in any proceedings in court notwithstanding any written law or rule
of law to the contrary, as stated, in my view the admissibility of these
statements and documents do not further translate into an accused person
having a right to be supplied with or to inspect the same.
[112] Admissibility, in other words, does not equate to the entitlement to
these documents and statements, what more prior to the commencement of
trial. No statutory provisions have been shown to this court that seek to have
that effect, because it is manifest that no such provisions exist. They do not
exist because that is not the law.
[113] The risk of witness tampering or intimidation aside, potential
witnesses may also be reluctant to come forward to give statement to the
authorities if the assurance of confidentiality is compromised. There may
also be repercussions which are prejudicial to other possible investigations
against the same accused.
[114] I do appreciate the argument of the applicant that witnesses are
compelled under the relevant provisions of the MACC Act and AMLATFA
to appear before the investigating officers to have their statements recorded.
It is not like in the context of s. 112 where there is no specific law making
non-attendance itself an offence.

[115] For example, it is noted that under s. 30(10) of the MACC Act,
contravention of s. 30 which includes a failure to attend upon being notified
to appear to give a statement is an offence punishable with jail terms upon
conviction under s. 69 of the same Act. A similar provision exists in s. 32(8)
of the AMLATFA which makes such failure or refusal an offence.

A

[116] However the point about threat of witness tampering is in my view
still relevant as it is legitimate. One who has given statements against the
accused would naturally not want his statement be given to the accused,
especially before trial even starts for obvious reasons. If the accused gets to
know of the details divulged by certain witnesses against the accused, there
is every reason to suspect that the accused would prefer the witness not to
repeat such statement in court if called as a witness. Surely, public policy
should protect against the risk of tampering in such not unlikely
circumstances.

B

[117] The fact that the statements are taken by the MACC and not the police
does not change the position in law. Matters concerning public policy,
privileged documents and witness tampering are similarly relevant even if
investigations are under a different legislation such as MACC Act and
AMLATFA. In that sense, these considerations are essentially immutable in
this context.
[118] Furthermore, there is basis to contend that the investigators of the
MACC are considered as public officers under s. 6(2) of the MACC Act, thus
attracting the application of s. 124 of the Evidence Act 1950 which means
that communication made to officers of MACC in official confidence cannot
be compelled to be disclosed if they consider that public interest would suffer
by such disclosure (see also the Federal Court decision in Suruhanjaya
Sekuriti v. Datuk Ishak Ismail [2016] 3 CLJ 19; [2016] 1 MLJ 733).
[119] The only circumstances when the defence may be given access to
statements of prosecution witnesses, is when the defence seeks to impeach the
credit of a witness, during trial under s. 145 of the Evidence Act 1950.
[120] It bears repetition that the key premise of the applicant’s request is that
the relevant documents which were procured under s. 30(9) of the MACC
Act and s. 40 of the AMLATFA, are according to the counsel for the
applicant, based on the words of the provisions, automatically admissible,
and that the issue of their relevancy is already assumed.
[121] However, in my judgment, any significant change in the law governing
our criminal justice system should only be effected by express legislative
amendments. Despite the fundamental change as asserted by the applicant on
the position of the issue of ready admissibility or such statements and
documents, as said to have been introduced by the MACC Act and the
AMLATFA, these same pieces of legislation fall short of enacting any
provisions to also permit let alone compel the production of such documents.

[122] If the consequences highlighted by the applicant are to be properly
appreciated, it would be expected that the legislation would contain
provisions permitting or compelling production of the documents, in order
to further give meaningful effect to s. 30(9) of the MACC Act and s. 40 of
the AMLATFA. But this is patently not the case. This is quite unlike the
position in the CPC which enacted ss. 51 and 51A for such purpose.
[123] The applicant gave much emphasis on the argument that s. 112 of the
CPC, unlike s. 30 of the MACC Act and s. 40 of the AMLATFA does not
provide for the admissibility of statements taken by the police. In my view,
whilst such assertion is not inaccurate, it still does not help establish the case
for the applicant for the production of the statements and documents
requested for under the MACC Act and the AMLATFA.
[124] I have already shown that it is also arguable whether the non-obstante
clauses have the legal effect as contended by the applicant. The aspects on
privileged documents, clients’ confidentiality, and threat of witness
tampering are not subordinate to these non-obstante clauses. Quite the
reverse, the non-obstante clauses operate subject to these three considerations.
There is crucially, additionally no compelling legal analysis that could
support the quantum leap from automatic admissibility to right to inspection.
The present law governing disclosure of statements and documents before
commencement of trial would as such extend to criminal proceedings based
on investigations undertaken under the MACC Act and the AMLATFA.
[125] For completeness, for the same reasons justifying refusal of the supply
of the statements and documents under s. 51 of the CPC given the weight of
the case law authorities, the applicant’s request for a witness list be furnished
to him before the commencement of trial too cannot be acceded to (see also
the Court of Appeal decision on the same refusal in PP v. Dato’ Seri Anwar
Ibrahim And Another Appeal [2010] 4 CLJ 331).
Conclusion

[126] In view of the reasons set out in the foregoing, in my judgment the
applicant has failed to establish his case for the delivery of the information
and documents applied for in the notice of motion, as amended. As such the
application is dismissed.
