The first and second appellants were charged under s. 3A Firearms
(Increased Penalties) Act 1971 (‘the Act’) for being accomplices in a case of
discharge of a firearm at the time of committing an offence with intent to
cause death or hurt on any person. The third appellant was charged under
s. 3 of the Act for discharging a firearm in the commission of a scheduled
offence. All three appellants were found guilty, convicted and sentenced to
death by the High Court. They have filed separate appeals, hence, the three
appeals were heard together before this court. On the material date,
17 March 2006, the deceased and SP10 were getting into a car outside a
supermarket when a male, who was later identified as the third appellant, had

approached the deceased and asked him for money while pointing a pistol
at him. In an ensuing struggle, SP10 heard a gunshot and the scream of the
deceased, who was then pushed into a car whilst SP10 was also dragged into
the same car by another person. SP10 saw that there were a few men inside
the car. Along the way, SP10 was asked to leave the car at a place he did
not know and at that time SP10 stated that there were no movements by the
deceased, who had been in the backseat of the car. Subsequently, SP3, a
security guard, found the body of the deceased in an open space and alerted
the police. A year later, a pistol (exh. P20B) was found in the possession of
one Haniffa at the same time of the arrest of the third appellant. Haniffa was
charged for possession of the same but no investigation was carried out on
Haniffa as to his involvement in the present case. In the appeal herein, a
number of issues were raised for the first and second appellants which were
(i) the identity of the deceased had not been proven and related to this, was
the issue on the post mortem report marked as ID38; (ii) the involvement
and degree of participation of the first and second appellants and proof of
their intentions; (iii) the existence of a fourth person named ‘Thambi’; and
(iv) the non-calling of important witnesses. The third appellant adopted the
submissions of the first and second appellants in toto and added another issue
on the identification parade, which he alleged was improper and highly
irregular.
Held (allowing appeals; acquitting and discharging appellants)
Per Balia Yusof Wahi JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) The charge against both the first and second appellants under s. 3A of
the Act required the element of knowledge to be proven. The ingredient
of the offence that both the first and second appellants had knowledge
that the third appellant carried a firearm at the time of the commission
of the scheduled offence of robbery with intent to cause death had not
been proven by the prosecution. In so far as the involvement of the first
and second appellants was concerned, the evidence merely suggested
that while the shooting was carried out by the third appellant, the first
appellant was merely driving the car away from the supermarket car
park and the deceased was seated in between the second appellant and
SP10. There was no evidence which showed that the first and second
appellants may reasonably be presumed to have knowledge that the third
appellant had a firearm. The trial judge had found that being at the scene
of the crime when the robbery and the discharge of the firearm was
committed was sufficient to hold both the first and second appellants as
being involved in the crime. The trial judge had fallen into error in so
holding. (paras 15 & 16)
(2) The reliance placed by the trial judge on ID38 in concluding that death
was caused by firearms injury to the chest was misplaced. ID38 was
inadmissible as evidence. Its production was not in accordance with
s. 32 of the Evidence Act 1950 and it was merely put in for



448

Current Law Journal

[2015] 4 CLJ

identification. There were also other infirmities in ID38 itself in that the
identity of the deceased had not been satisfactorily proven. SP10 who
would be the best person to identify the deceased to the pathologist who
carried out the post mortem did not do so. He only identified the
deceased from the photographs shown but not for purpose of
identification at the autopsy. Another person who would be able to
positively identify the deceased would be the cousin, Mujibur Rahman,
as stated in ID38 but he too was not called to testify on this issue.
Further, the oral testimony of SP15 stated that he saw a naked dead body
at the scene and the naked body was brought to the hospital for post
mortem. Whereas ID38 stated that the body was dressed in blue shirt
and grey slacks. Further, the post mortem report merely showed two
firearms entry wounds and not three as the trial judge had found. This
was an erroneous finding made by the trial judge. (paras 18, 28 & 31)
(3) The gist of the three appellants’ defence was that it was one Thambi who
had the firearm and fired the shot that killed the deceased. The trial
judge had acknowledged the existence or rather the presence of the
fourth person as claimed by the defence. The evidence of SP10
confirmed that there was a fourth person, who was not only in the car
when the deceased was taken away after being shot at the car park, but
also before the shooting itself. The existence of the fourth person as
claimed by the defence could not be a bare denial. The fourth person did
exist and it was part of the prosecution’s case. The conclusion reached
by the trial judge was plainly erroneous. (paras 32 & 34)
(4) Haniffa was an important witness who could testify on the causal link
between the pistol allegedly used by the third appellant and the pistol
for which he was charged for being in possession of. How the same pistol
changed hands between the third appellant and Haniffa could only be
explained by Haniffa. The failure of the prosecution to call Haniffa left
a gap in the prosecution’s case against the appellants, a gap which in the
circumstances was fatal. (paras 36 & 37)
(5) When the manner of the identification parade held was unfair to the
accused, the subsequent identification in court was of little value or
significance. In the instant case, having considered the factual matrix of
the matter on the aspect of identification, the court identification of the
third appellant by SP10 was of little value or significance. The
identification of the appellant was an essential part of the prosecution's
case which needed to be proven satisfactorily. The identification parade
was improperly held and unfair to the third appellant. (para 44)
(6) There were merits in the appeal by the three appellants. Given the errors
committed by the trial judge and the infirmities in the prosecution’s
case, the conviction of the appellants were unsafe. In a criminal case,
the court’s duty is to consider whether the conviction of the appellant

is right. It is not whether the decision of the trial judge is wrong but
whether the conviction is safe (Mohd Johi Said & Anor v. PP, refd).

Perayu pertama dan kedua dipertuduh di bawah s. 3A Akta Senjata Api
(Penalti Lebih Berat) 1971 (‘Akta’) kerana menjadi rakan jenayah dalam kes
melepaskan tembakan pada masa melakukan satu kesalahan dengan niat
menyebabkan kematian atau kecederaan ke atas seseorang. Perayu ketiga
dipertuduh di bawah s. 3 Akta kerana melepaskan das tembakan semasa
melakukan kesalahan berjadual. Ketiga-tiga perayu didapati bersalah,
disabitkan dan dijatuhkan hukuman mati oleh Mahkamah Tinggi. Mereka
telah memfailkan rayuan secara berasingan, dengan itu, ketiga-tiga rayuan
didengar bersama di mahkamah ini. Pada tarikh material, 17 Mac 2006, si
mati dan SP10 sedang memasuki sebuah kereta di hadapan satu pasar raya
apabila seorang lelaki, yang kemudiannya dikenal pasti sebagai perayu
ketiga, telah mendekati si mati dan meminta duit sambil mengacukan pistol
kepadanya. Dalam pergelutan yang berlaku selepas itu, SP10 mendengar
bunyi tembakan dan jeritan si mati, yang telah ditolak ke dalam sebuah
kereta manakala SP10 juga telah diheret ke dalam kereta yang sama oleh
seorang lagi. SP10 melihat bahawa terdapat beberapa orang lelaki dalam
kereta tersebut. Dalam perjalanan seterusnya, SP10 diminta keluar dari
kereta di suatu tempat yang dia tidak diketahuinya dan pada waktu itu SP10
menyatakan bahawa si mati yang berada di bahagian belakang kereta sudah
berhenti bergerak. Berikutnya, SP3, seorang pengawal keselamatan,
menemui mayat si mati di kawasan terbuka dan melaporkannya pada pihak
polis. Setahun kemudian, sepucuk pistol (eks. P20B) dijumpai dalam milikan
seorang yang bernama Haniffa dan pada waktu yang sama perayu ketiga telah
ditangkap. Hanifa dipertuduh mempunyai milikan ke atas senjata api itu
tetapi tiada siasatan dijalankan ke atas Haniffa berkenaan penglibatannya
dalam kes ini. Dalam rayuan ini, beberapa isu telah dibangkitkan untuk
perayu pertama dan kedua iaitu (i) identiti si mati tidak dibuktikan dan
berhubungan dengan itu, adalah isu laporan bedah siasat yang ditanda sebagai
ID38; (ii) penglibatan dan tahap penyertaan perayu pertama dan kedua dan
bukti niat mereka; (iii) kewujudan orang keempat bernama ‘Thambi’ dan (iv)
kegagalan memanggil saksi-saksi penting. Perayu ketiga menerima pakai
hujahan-hujahan perayu pertama dan kedua dan menambah lagi satu isu
mengenai kawad cam, dengan dakwaan bahawa ia telah dijalankan secara
tidak wajar dan tidak teratur.
Diputuskan (membenarkan rayuan-rayuan; melepaskan dan membebaskan
perayu-perayu)
Oleh Balia Yusof Wahi HMR menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah:
(1) Pertuduhan terhadap kedua-dua perayu pertama dan kedua di bawah
s. 3A Akta memerlukan elemen pengetahuan dibuktikan. Intipati
kesalahan bahawa kedua-dua perayu pertama dan kedua mempunyai



450

Current Law Journal

[2015] 4 CLJ

pengetahuan bahawa perayu ketiga membawa senjata api semasa
melakukan kesalahan berjadual iaitu rompakan dengan niat
menyebabkan kematian tidak dibuktikan oleh pihak pendakwaan.
Setakat penglibatan perayu pertama dan kedua, keterangan hanya
menyarankan bahawa semasa tembakan dilakukan oleh perayu ketiga,
perayu pertama hanya memandu kereta keluar dari tempat kereta pasar
raya tersebut dan si mati duduk di antara perayu kedua dan SP10. Tiada
keterangan menunjukkan bahawa perayu pertama dan kedua
semunasabahnya dianggap berpengetahuan bahawa perayu ketiga
mempunyai senjata api. Hakim bicara telah mendapati bahawa dengan
adanya perayu pertama dan kedua di tempat kejadian di mana rompakan
dan lepasan tembakan telah berlaku adalah memadai untuk memutuskan
bahawa perayu pertama dan kedua terlibat dalam jenayah itu. Hakim
bicara telah terkhilaf dalam membuat kesimpulan tersebut.
(2) Pergantungan yang diletakkan oleh hakim bicara ke atas ID38 dalam
memutuskan bahawa kematian disebabkan oleh kecederaan senjata api
ke bahagian dada adalah salah. ID38 tidak boleh diterima sebagai
keterangan. Pengemukaannya tidak mengikut s. 32 Akta Keterangan
1950 dan ia hanya dikemukakan untuk pengenalpastian. Terdapat juga
kelemahan-kelemahan lain dalam ID38 sendiri di mana identiti si mati
tidak dibuktikan secara memuaskan. SP10 iaitu orang yang paling sesuai
untuk mengenalpasti si mati kepada pakar patologi yang menjalankan
bedah siasat tidak berbuat demikian. Dia hanya mengenalpasti si mati
daripada gambar-gambar yang ditunjukkan tetapi bukan untuk tujuan
identifikasi di autopsi. Seorang lagi yang boleh mengenalpasti si mati
adalah sepupunya, Mujibur Rahman, seperti yang dinyatakan dalam
ID38 tetapi dia juga tidak dipanggil untuk memberi keterangan
mengenai isu ini. Selanjutnya, testimoni secara lisan SP15 menyatakan
bahawa dia melihat sekujur mayat tidak berpakaian di tempat kejadian
dan mayat tidak berpakaian itu telah dibawa ke hospital untuk dibedah
siasat. Manakala ID38 menyatakan bahawa mayat tersebut dijumpai
berpakaian kemeja biru dan seluar kelabu. Seterusnya, laporan bedah
siasat hanya menunjukkan bahawa terdapat dua kemasukan luka senjata
api dan bukan tiga seperti yang didapati oleh hakim bicara. Dapatan
yang dibuat oleh hakim bicara adalah salah.
(3) Intipati pembelaan ketiga-tiga perayu adalah bahawa seorang yang
bernama Thambi yang telah mempunyai senjata api dan melepaskan
tembakan yang telah membunuh si mati. Hakim bicara telah mengakui
kewujudan atau kehadiran orang keempat ini seperti yang didakwa oleh
pihak pembelaan. Keterangan SP10 mengesahkan bahawa terdapat orang
keempat bukan hanya dalam kereta tersebut apabila si mati dibawa pergi
selepas ditembak di tempat letak kereta, tetapi juga sebelum
penembakan itu berlaku. Kewujudan orang keempat seperti yang

didakwa oleh pihak pembelaan bukanlah penafian kosong. Orang
keempat sememangnya wujud dan ia adalah sebahagian kes pendakwaan.
Kesimpulan yang dicapai oleh hakim bicara adalah dengan jelasnya
salah.
(4) Haniffa adalah saksi penting yang boleh memberi keterangan berkenaan
pertalian sebab antara pistol yang didakwa digunakan oleh perayu ketiga
dan pistol yang didakwa berada dalam milikan Haniffa. Bagaimana
pistol itu boleh bertukar tangan antara perayu ketiga dan Haniffa hanya
boleh dijelaskan oleh Haniffa. Kegagalan pihak pendakwaan untuk
memanggil Haniffa meninggalkan jurang dalam kes pihak pendakwaan
terhadap perayu-perayu, jurang yang dalam keadaan ini adalah fatal.
(5) Apabila kawad cam dijalankan secara tidak adil terhadap tertuduh, nilai
dan kepentingan pengenalpastian seterusnya di mahkamah menjadi
berkurangan. Dalam kes ini, setelah mempertimbangkan fakta matrik
perkara dari aspek pengenalpastian, identifikasi yang dibuat oleh
mahkamah berkenaan perayu ketiga oleh SP10 mempunyai nilai dan
kepentingan yang berkurangan. Pengenalpastian perayu adalah satu
bahagian penting kes pendakwaan yang perlu dibuktikan secara
memuaskan. Kawad cam telah dijalankan secara tidak wajar dan adalah
tidak adil kepada perayu ketiga.
(6) Terdapat merit-merit dalam rayuan oleh ketiga-tiga perayu.
Memandangkan terdapat kesilapan oleh hakim bicara dan kelemahankelemahan dalam kes pihak pendakwaan, sabitan perayu-perayu adalah
tidak selamat. Dalam satu-satu kes jenayah, tanggungjawab mahkamah
adalah untuk mempertimbangkan sama ada sabitan perayu adalah betul.
Ia bukan sama ada keputusan hakim bicara adalah salah tetapi sama ada
sabitan adalah selamat (Mohd Johi Said & Anor v. PP, refd).

Brief Facts
[6]
SP10 was the only eyewitness in the case. On 17 March 2006 at about
9pm together with one Jainul Abdeen (the deceased), he left the Giant
Hypermarket, Kelana Jaya and headed for their car at the car park. SP10 sat

on the front passenger seat while the deceased was at the wheel. SP10 saw
a male approaching the deceased and pointed a pistol at him. The deceased
was directed by the said male to follow him. SP10 also saw another male
standing near the car he was in.
[7]
SP10 heard the first male asking the deceased to “mengeluarkan duit”.
Then, the other male directed SP10 to get out of the car and pulled his hands.
SP10 saw the first male pointing a pistol at the deceased’s waist. This male
was later identified as the third appellant (Jaibalan). When the deceased was
pulled by the third appellant, the deceased tried to release himself and in the
ensuing struggle, SP10 heard a gunshot and the scream of the deceased. The
deceased was then pushed into a car whilst SP10 was also dragged into the
car by another person.
[8]
In the car, SP10 saw that there was a male at the wheel, the third
appellant sat on the front passenger seat and another male sat behind the
driver. Next to the male was the deceased. SP10 was seated next to the
deceased whilst the man who held SP10 was seated left most behind the third
appellant. That means, beside SP10 and the deceased there were four other
males in the car. The car then left the Giant Hypermarket car park.
[9]
Along the way, SP10 was asked to leave the car at a place he did not
know. At that time, to use his own words, SP10 stated “there were no
movements by the deceased” nor did he say anything.
[10] SP3, a security guard, found the body of the deceased in an open space
and alerted the police.

F

G

[11] A pistol (exh. P20B) was found in the possession of one Haniffa about
a year after the incident and the same time of the arrest of the third appellant.
Haniffa was charged for possession of the same and he had been granted a
DNAA. No investigation was carried out on Haniffa as to his involvement
in the present case as admitted by the investigating officer, SP15.
The Appeal
[12] A number of issues were raised by learned counsel for the first and
second appellants which may be summarised as follows:
(a) Identity of the deceased had not been proven and related to this, is the
issue on the post mortem report which was marked only as ID38.

H

(b) The involvement and degree of participation of the first and second
appellants and proof of their intentions.
(c) The existence of a fourth person “Thambi”.

I

(d) Failure of the prosecution to include s. 34 of the Penal Code in the
charge.
(e) Non-calling of important witnesses.

[2015] 4 CLJ

[13] Learned counsel for the third appellant adopted the submissions of the
first and second appellants’ counsel in toto and added another issue on the
identification parade which was held about 1-1 1/2 years after the incident.
It was submitted that the identification parade was improper and highly
irregular.

A

[14] We heard the three appeals together and having considered the
submissions of all parties, both written and oral, we unanimously allowed
the appeals, set aside the conviction and sentence on the three appellants and
made an order of acquittal and discharge on the trio. We now give our
reasons for so ordering.

B

Involvement Of The Appellants
[15] In allowing the appeals, we have, among others, considered the
concession made by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor that in so far as
the involvement of the first and second appellants is concerned, the evidence
merely suggest that while the shooting was carried out by the third appellant,
the first appellant was merely driving the car away from the Giant
Hypermarket car park and the second appellant was seated behind the driver.
The deceased was seated in between the second appellant and SP10. The
learned Deputy Public Prosecutor also conceded that there is no evidence
which shows that the first and second appellants may reasonably be
presumed to have knowledge that the third appellant had a firearm.
[16] The charge against both the first and second appellants under s. 3A of
the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971 (FIPA) requires the element of
knowledge to be proven. The ingredient of the offence that both the first and
second appellants had knowledge that the third appellant carried a firearm
at the time of the commission of the scheduled offence of robbery with intent
to cause death had not been proven by the prosecution. SP10 was the only
witness to the incident. The evidence is totally lacking on this aspect. The
shooting took place at the Giant Hypermarket car park and subsequent to
that, the deceased and SP10 were shoved into a car with three other males
inside, one at the wheel and the other two at the back passenger seat. The
third appellant sat on the front passenger seat.
[17] In implicating the first and the second appellants to the crime charged,
the learned trial judge had made the following findings at pp. 25-27 of the
appeal record:

C

D

E

F

G

H

The identification of the First and Second Accused by SP10 is not
doubted as SP10 sat in the car for sometimes before he was asked to
leave. SP10 withstood cross-examination that there was sufficient lighting
for him to identify both the First and Second Accused in the car.
As such both the First and Second Accused were at the scene when the
offences of robbery and discharging the firearms was committed and
therefore involved in the crime.

I



[2015] 4 CLJ
A

Mohammed Rafi v. PP & Other Appeals

455

Therefore all the three (3) Accused were involved as per the charge. All
three of them were at the scene of the crime ie, “Kawasan Giant” and
their participations are as follow:
(1) Discharge of firearm by the Third Accused;
(2) Robbery, demand by the Third Accused;

B

(3) Death of deceased (Jainul Abdeen); and
(4) The First and Second Accused were in the car, in fact the Second
Accused drove the car.

D

E

F

G

H

Since all the ingredients of both the charges were proven, all three (3)
Accused were asked to enter their defences. All of them elected to give
evidence on oath. (emphasis added)

[18] It was the judge’s finding that all the three appellants were at the scene
of the crime at the time of the discharge of the firearm and the robbery by
the third appellant. It was also Her Ladyship’s finding that the first and
second appellants were in the car with the second appellant driving the same.
The learned trial judge found, being at the scene of the crime when the
robbery and the discharge of the firearm was committed was sufficient to
hold both the first and second appellants as being involved in the crime. We
find the learned trial judge had fallen into error in so holding. Referring to
the charge framed against the first and second appellants, we found that the
prosecution had failed to prove that both the first and second appellants had
any knowledge that the third appellant was carrying or having a firearm.
Neither can knowledge be inferred in the circumstances of the case. And the
learned Deputy Public Prosecutor had conceded to this.
[19] We agree with the submissions of learned counsel and we further rule
that the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor had rightly conceded on the issue
of the involvement of the first and second appellants and their knowledge
about firearm. On this ground alone we would allow the appeals by the first
and second appellants.
[20] For the aforesaid reason, we do not see any real purpose whether the
other issues raised by learned counsel of the first and second appellants
merits our further consideration. Be that as it may, since these other issues
are also relevant for consideration of the third appellant’s appeal, we will
accordingly deal with them in terms of its relevancy to the third appellant’s
appeal. We have noted earlier that learned counsel for the third appellant
adopts in toto the issues raised by the first and second appellants as stated in
paras. 12 and 13 of this judgement.
Identity Of The Deceased And The Post Mortem Report

I

[21] We will now deal with the issue of the identity of the deceased and
related to that, is the post mortem report, exh. ID38. The learned trial judge
had rightly ruled that death of the deceased, one by the name of Jainul
Abdeen (Pasport: E5375042) is among the ingredients of the offence for
which the appellants stand charged.

[22] In proving the death of Jainul Abdeen, the prosecution sought to rely
on the evidence from the post mortem report marked as ID38. Exhibit ID38
was tendered by SP16, one Dr Mathi Haran Karunakaran, an associate
professor at University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). SP16 did not
carry out the post mortem. It was conducted by one Dr Virendran Kumar
who has since left service and gone back to his country of origin, India. SP16
was the supervisor at UMMC and he oversees post mortem being carried out
at the centre. He has never met Dr Virendran, does not know him and was
no more working with the hospital. SP16 was called merely to tender the
post mortem report to be marked as ID38. The post mortem was conducted
on 18 March 2006 and SP16 only joined UMMC in 2009.
[23] ID38 is an autopsy report on Jainul Abdeen bin Abdul Jabbar. The
post mortem was carried out by Dr Virendran Kumar and the body was
identified by ASP Mohd Hamidi b Daud (SP15). SP15 went to the place
where the deceased was found on 17 March 2006 at about 11.05pm and saw
a dead body without any clothes on. He also stated the relatives and friends
of the deceased were also at the scene and confirmed the deceased to be
Jainul Abdeen bin Abdul Jabbar (p. 129 of appeal record). He further stated
he attended the post mortem being conducted by Dr Virendran Kumar and
the body was brought to the hospital naked. As the initial investigating
officer, SP15 did not carry out any investigation or made any attempt to trace
Dr Virendran Kumar. SP14, another investigating officer in the case also said
nothing about any effort to trace the said Dr Virendran Kumar. SP21, yet
another investigating officer in the case, testified that on 30 May 2011
Interpol Bukit Aman sent a signal to Interpol India regarding Dr Virendran
Kumar but received no reply. He did nothing further.

[24] Another person mentioned in exh. ID 38 was Mujibur Rahman,
described as the cousin of the deceased. However, Mujibur Rahman was not
called to testify on the identity of the deceased. SP10 identified the deceased
from the photographs showed to him in court but he was not present at the
autopsy.

G

[25] The cause of death is stated in ID38 as firearms injuries to the chest
and the report also described the body was dressed in a blue shirt and grey
pair of slacks.
[26] Learned counsel submitted that ID 38 is not admissible and the
learned trial judge had erred in relying on the said exhibit in concluding and
making a finding that death to the person named in the report was proven
and the cause of death being firearm injuries to the chest. The learned trial
judge had also erred in relying on the evidence of SP16 (the supervisor at
UMMC) and SP20 a Medical Forensic Consultant who testified just by
looking at ID38, the injuries sustained by the deceased led to his death.

Mohammed Rafi v. PP & Other Appeals

457

[27] The learned trial judge had made the following finding on death. At
pp. 23-24 of the appeal record, Her Ladyship stated:
Death

C

In respect of this ingredient, there is without a doubt there was a death.
The body of the Deceased (Jainul Abdeen) was identified by SP10 and
his death was certified to be as a result of a “fire arm injuries to the
Chest” (ID38). This report remained as an ID as the Doctor who
performed the Post Mortem (Dr Virendran Kumar) could not be traced
as he had left the service of the PPUM and the country. However SP16
who is a Supervisor at UMMC where the Post Mortem of the Deceased
was done produced the Post Mortem Report (ID38).

D

Subsequently SP20, a Medical Forensic Consultant testified that looking
at ID38, the injuries sustained by the Deceased led to his death.
Therefore it is without a doubt the Deceased died from the gun shot
injuries. There was no challenge by the First and Second Accused on his
testimony. The questions posed by the Third Accused in Cross
Examination did not mar SP20’s evidence.

B

E

F

G

H

I

[28] In our view, the reliance placed by the learned trial judge on ID38 in
concluding that death was caused by firearms injury to the chest is misplaced.
ID 38 is inadmissible as evidence. Its production was not in accordance with
s. 32 of the Evidence Act 1950 and it was merely put in for identification.
Abdoolcader J (as he then was) in Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Haji Harun Haji
Idris & Ors [1977] 1 LNS 92; [1977] 1 MLJ 180 at p. 183 when referring to
exhibits marked as ID said:
… certain exhibits which have been put in the course of these proceedings
for identification but have not in fact been proved as they should have
been and are accordingly not exhibits in the strict sense and cannot
therefore form part of the record in the case, namely, D41 and D43 which
were both put in identification only and which are the audited accounts
and annual report of the Bank for the years 1973-74 and 1972 respectively.
As these two exhibits have not been proved and properly admitted as
such, they must in the ultimate analysis be discounted and I shall
accordingly disregard references to them and also all oral testimony as
well adduced in relation thereto.

[29] Besides, we do note that there are also other infirmities in ID38 itself
in that the identity of the deceased had not been satisfactorily proven. SP10
who would be the best person to identify the deceased to the pathologist who
carried out the post mortem did not do so. He only identified the deceased
from the photographs shown but not for purpose of identification at the
autopsy. Another person who would be able to positively identify the
deceased would be the cousin, Mujibur Rahman as stated in ID38, but he too
was not called to testify on this issue. Further, the oral testimony of SP15
stated that he saw a naked dead body at the scene and the naked dead body
was brought to the hospital for post mortem. Whereas, ID38 states the body
was dressed in blue shirt and grey slacks.

[30] Referring to the injuries stated in ID38, it was recorded that there were
two firearm entrance wounds 0.8cm x 0.5cm over the right side front chest
and over the dorsum of the left hand. It also states one firearm exit wound
2cm x 1cm over the palmer aspect of left hand. The learned trial judge
however at p. 22 of the appeal record stated in her judgment as:

A

The post mortem conducted on the Deceased showed that there were
three bullets entry points and three exit points and the death was certified
to be as a result of firearm injuries to the chest.

B

[31] We found, that this is an erroneous finding made by the learned trial
judge. It is unsupported by evidence. The post mortem report even if it was
admissible merely showed two firearm entry wounds and not three as the
learned trial judge had found.

C

The Existence Of A Fourth Person, Thambi
[32] The learned trial judge had rightly found that the gist of the three
appellants’ defence was that it was Thambi who had the firearm and fired the
shot that killed the deceased. Her Ladyship also made a finding that the
defence story does not differ from what SP10 had testified save that it was
Thambi who discharged the firearm. At p. 31 of the appeal record the learned
trial judge found:
Basically the Defence story does not differ from what SP10 said save that
it was Thambi who discharged the firearm. However the fact remains that
the Three (3) Accused were around at the scene of the crime. The Third
Accused went with them and with another person confronted the
Deceased and SP10. The First and Second Accused were in the Proton
Wira which as claimed by the Defence belonged to Thambi.

D

E

F

[33] From the above passage it is apparent that the learned trial judge had
acknowledged the existence or rather the presence of the fourth person as
claimed by the defence and also as testified by SP10, yet Her Ladyship found
that “It is a bare denial and a story that is full of gaps and unanswered
questions” (p. 30 appeal record) and further concluded “the story is just not
probable or possible” (p. 31 appeal record).
[34] We cannot agree with the learned trial judge that the defence is a bare
denial and neither can we agree that the defence story is not probable. The
evidence of the prosecution witness, SP10, confirmed that there was a fourth
person not only in the car when the deceased was taken away after being shot
at the car park, but also before the shooting itself. The existence of the fourth
person as claimed by the defence could not be a bare denial. The fourth
person did exist and it was part of the prosecution’s case. In the upshot, the
conclusion reached by the learned trial judge on the defence is plainly
erroneous.

Non-Calling Of Important Witnesses

B

[35] It was submitted before us that the person named Haniffa is an
important witness and the failure of the prosecution to call him leave a gap
in the prosecution’s case against the appellants. As what we have adverted
to earlier, Haniffa was charged for possession of a firearm which happened
to be the pistol tendered by the prosecution in the instant case (exh. P20B).
The pistol was recovered from Haniffa about one year after the date of the
alleged offence in the instant appeal. The third appellant was also arrested
at the same time. The case against Haniffa was granted a DNAA. No other
details were proffered by the prosecution.

C

D

E

[36] We agree with the submissions of learned counsel that Haniffa is an
important witness who can testify on the causal link between the pistol
allegedly used by the third appellant and the pistol for which he was charged
for being in possession of. There is a lingering doubt according to counsel
whether the fourth person in the car was Thambi or could he be this person,
Haniffa. How the same pistol changed hands between the third appellant and
Haniffa can only be explained by Haniffa. After all, it is the prosecution’s
case that this same pistol was the one used by the third appellant.
[37] We found merits in the appellants’ contention that Haniffa is an
important witness to unfold the narratives of the prosecution’s case against
the third appellant. We agree that there is a gap in the prosecution’s case
against the third appellant, a gap which in the circumstances is fatal.
Failure To Include s. 34 Of The Penal Code

F

G

H

I

[38] This issue was brought up by the first and second appellants and
adopted by the third appellant. With due respect, we do not see how this
issue is relevant to the third appellant. He was charged alone for discharging
the firearm. We have reproduced the charge against him in the earlier part
of this judgment and we need say no more.
[39] As for the first and second appellants, we are of the view that the
failure of the prosecution to include s. 34 of the Penal Code in the charge
proffered against them is immaterial. We say so simply on the basis that by
the wordings of s. 3A of the Firearm (Increased Penalties) Act 1971, s. 34
of the Penal Code is not relevant. For ease of reference we set out the said
provision which reads as follows:
Section 3A. Penalty for accomplices in case of discharge of firearm.
Where, with intent to cause death or hurt to any person, a firearm is
discharged by any person at the time of his committing or attempting to
commit or abetting the commission of a scheduled offence, each of his
accomplices in respect of the offence present at the scene of the
commission or attempted commission or abetment thereof who may
reasonably be presumed to have known that such person was carrying or
had in his possession or under his custody or control the firearm shall,



460

Current Law Journal

[2015] 4 CLJ

notwithstanding that no hurt is caused by the discharge thereof, be
punished with death, unless he proves that he had taken all reasonable
steps to prevent the discharge.

[40] By the wordings of the provision, it is incumbent upon the prosecution
to prove that the first and second appellants are accomplices in respect of the
offence. It is also incumbent on the part of the prosecution to prove that the
first and second appellants may reasonably be presumed to have known that
the third appellant had in his custody or control the firearm. By the same
token we agree with the submissions of the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor
that it is erroneous on the part of learned counsel to submit that the failure
to include s. 34 of the Penal Code is fatal to the charge.

Identification Parade
[41] The only additional issue raised by learned counsel for the third
appellant is on the identification parade held in respect of the third appellant.
There were two identification parades held. According to learned counsel,
the identification parades were held about a year or a year and half after the
incident. Learned counsel further submitted, as evident from the testimony
of SP10 during cross-examination, the participants in the identification
parade were of various make up. Some were tall, while others were short and
there were also others with moustache and beard. The third appellant was
on a wheelchair. He was identified by SP10 as the person who fired the shot.
He was identified at the second identification parade. It was submitted that
the identification parade was not proper, irregular and unfair to the third
appellant. It was a bad identification.
[42] In his submission in reply, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor
submitted that even if the identification parade was defective and improperly
held, there was dock identification of the third appellant by SP10. The case
of Ong Poh Cheng v. PP [1998] 4 CLJ 1; [1998] 4 MLJ 8 was cited in support
of this submission.
[43] In PP v. Pasupathy Kanagasaby [2001] 2 CLJ 753; [2001] 2 MLJ 143,
this court had held that to ensure that the parade is properly and fairly held,
it is the duty of the officer conducting the parade to look for participants who
are of similar age, stature and appearance as the accused person.
[44] In our view, the identification parade was improperly held and unfair
to the third appellant. In Goh Kooi Pheng v. PP [2013] 1 CLJ 190, (Criminal
Appeal No: P-05-135- 2010) this court had said; when the manner of the
identification parade held was unfair to the accused, the subsequent
identification in court was of little value or significance as was earlier held
in Public Prosecutor v. Mohamed Majid [1976] 1 LNS 104; [1977] 1 MLJ 121.
Likewise, in the instant case, having considered the factual matrix of the
matter on the aspect of identification, we find that the court identification of

the third appellant by SP10 is of little value or significance. The
identification of the appellant is an essential part of the prosecution’s case
which needs to be proven satisfactorily.
[45] We found there are merits in the appeal by the three appellants. Given
the errors committed by the learned trial judge and the infirmities in the
prosecution’s case, we find the conviction of the appellants to be unsafe. In
a criminal case, our duty is to consider whether the conviction of the
appellant is right. It is not whether the decision of the trial judge is wrong
but whether the conviction is safe. (Mohd Johi Said & Anor v. PP [2005] 1 CLJ
389)
[46] For the aforesaid reasons, we allow the appeals and set aside the
conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court. The three appellants are
hereby acquitted and discharged.
