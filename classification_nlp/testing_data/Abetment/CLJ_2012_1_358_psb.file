PP v. Azilah Hadri & Ors

359

The first accused (Azilah bin Hadri, a police inspector) and the
second accused (Sirul Azhar bin Hj Umar, a police corporal) were
charged for the offence of murder of one Altantuya Shaariibuu, an
offence punishable under s. 302 of the Penal Code read together
with s. 34 of the same Code. The third accused (Abdul Razak bin
Abdullah) was charged for an offence of abetting the two accused
persons in the commission of the said murder, an offence
punishable under s. 109 of the Penal Code read together with
s. 302 of the same Code. The deceased’s bone and tissue
fragments had been recovered in the forest area in Puncak Alam.
The cause of death was said to be “probable blast related
injuries”. According to the prosecution, the third accused had had
an affair with the deceased which ended in August 2005.
Thereafter, the deceased came to Kuala Lumpur on 8 October
2006 with a cousin (SP3) and a friend (SP4) and had threatened
the life of the third accused’s daughter for money. According to
the prosecution, the third accused then conspired with the first
and second accused to murder the deceased. Balasubramaniam
(SP1), a private investigator hired by the third accused, testified
that on 19 October 2006 at about 7.20pm, the deceased came to
the third accused’s house. At that time, the first and second
accused arrived in a Proton Wira car together with Lans Corporal
Rohaniza bt Roslan (SP7) and detained the deceased. They then
took the deceased away. SP7 testified that on that night they
took the deceased to Bukit Aman. From there, the first accused
claimed that he was going to take the deceased back to her hotel
and SP7 did not follow them. The first accused and the deceased
then left in a Suzuki Vitara car driven by a man in a green cap.
However, in her cross examination, SP7 said that she was
confused as there were many statements recorded from her by
different recording officers. She further said that while on remand,
she was abused and promised to be released if she agreed to say
that the first accused did get into the car. The prosecution sought
to introduce the “confession” of the second accused on his
involvements in the crime purportedly made voluntarily to ACP
Mastor bin Mohd. The first accused was said to have told the
police about the location where the murder was committed and
was said to have then led the police to the said location.
According to Chief Inspector Koh Fei Cheow (SP20), the first
accused told him “Inilah tempatnya perempuan Mongolia
diletupkan” and “Inilah tempat perempuan Mongolia ditembak”.
These informations according to SP20 were recorded in his
Investigation Diary. The prosecution sought to admit these



360

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

informations under s. 27 of the Evidence Act 1950 (“EA50”)
Further, according to SP20, the second accused had given him
information regarding the whereabouts of the deceased’s jewellery
and had later led SP20 to his house where the jewellery was
recovered. The prosecution sought to admit these informations too
under s. 27 of EA50.

A

B

Held (convicting the first & second accused for murder;
acquitting and discharging the third accused):
(1) The law with regard to confession to a person in authority is
governed by s. 24 of EA50. The onus is for the prosecution
to prove that the alleged confession was made voluntarily
without any threat, promise, inducement and oppression.
There was obvious inducement and threat inflicted by ACP
Mastor in procuring the confession from the second accused.
The confession was actuated by fear in the mind of the
second accused exacted by ACP Mastor. Hence, the alleged
confession was involuntarily made and inadmissible as evidence.
(paras 72, 74 & 85)

C

D

(2) While the explanation advanced by SP7 was not absolutely
satisfactory but considering her evidence as a whole and the
evidence of the rest of the prosecution’s witnesses, the court
accepted all her explanations. (para 127)

E

(3) The court had no reasons to doubt the credibility and
reliability of SP20’s evidence that the first accused who was
also a Police Inspector and the investigation officer himself did
in fact supply the said information and that SP20 had no prior
knowledge of the particular place of the scene. The court thus
could not exercise its discretion to exclude them. (para 129)

F

(4) The said “barang-barang kemas” were discovered in
consequence to the said information supplied by the second
accused. The court therefore likewise refused to exercise its
discretion to exclude them. (para 130)

G

H

(5) Having considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution
in its totality, the court was satisfied that: (i) the fragment of
bones collected at the scene were that of the deceased; (ii)
the cause of death of the deceased was probable blast-related
I



[2012] 1 CLJ

A

PP v. Azilah Hadri & Ors

361

injuries; (iii) all the reference of “perempuan Cina” by SP7 was
actually the deceased; (iv) all the reference of “Vitara” by SP7
was actually “Suzuki 4WD”, ie, the second accused’s car and
(v) all the reference of “a man in green cap” was actually the
second accused. (paras 135 & 136)

B

C

D

E

(6) The notes written by the third accused that was found from
the first accused’s bag with the full address of his house in
the name of his father Dato’ Abdullah Malim Baginda, was
wholly consistent with that of an innocent man asking the first
accused in a bona fide manner for assistance, ie, for the police
to patrol the vicinity of the third accused’s house against the
deceased’s harassment and threats. (para 143)
(7) Even if the third accused can be inferred as having had any
“motive” in the light of all the blackmailing letters of the
deceased, it cannot be made a basis for his conviction
without any direct or circumstantial evidence of his
participation in any manner in the commission of the offence.
(para 145)
(8) Consequently, there was prima facie case for the first and
second accused to answer as charged. In the case of the
third accused, there was no prima facie case for him to answer
his charge. The third accused was not guilty and was
acquitted and discharged. (para 146)

F

G

H

I

(9) The defence of each of the accused were essentially one of
denial, of blaming one another, irreconcilable and ambivalent.
They failed to raise any reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s
case. The prosecution had proved the case against both the
first and the second accused beyond reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, both of them were found guilty and convicted as
charged and sentenced to death. (paras 154 & 155)

At the outset of this trial, the court had to deal with
several applications made by the learned counsels, namely:
(1) The application by way of motion for the production and
supply of the statement recorded from witnesses under s. 112
of Criminal Procedure Code (112 statement) in advance of the
trial (vide Permohonan Jenayah No. 44-77-2007) made by
En Kamarul Hisham, counsel for the second accused and
En KK Wong, counsel for the third accused. The application
of which I have rejected;
(2) The application by way of motion made by Mr Karpal Singh
who is holding watching brief for the deceased’s family and
the Government of Mongolia for him to be granted liberty to
take part in the trial, that is to examine witnesses and to
make submission at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case
and the case of the defence (vide Permohonan Jenayah
44-92-2007) which I have likewise rejected;
(3) The application by Mr Karpal Singh, summarily for the court
to direct En Hazman to discharge himself from acting for the
first accused for reason that his late wife was related to me in
that she was my third cousin which I have again rejected; and

(4) The yet summary application by Mr Karpal Singh for me to
recuse myself from presiding over this trial for the same reason
as No. 3 above which I have refused.
For all the aforesaid applications whereby my ruling with regard to
the supply of 112 statement and my recusal were taken up for
appeal, I had given my reasonings, separately in the respective
case number.
[5]
The prosecution in their lengthy opening statements had
laid down the nature of the offence charged and the evidence by
which they proposed to prove the guilt of all the accused persons.
They said that the evidence would be led to show a year long
affair the third accused had with the deceased. The said affair was
ended in August 2005 when the third accused had since refused
to see her. The prosecution sought to lead evidence that when
the deceased came to Kuala Lumpur on October 8, 2006 and had
threatened the life of the third accused’s daughter for money, the
third accused had conspired with the first and second accused to
murder the deceased. The cause of death of the deceased was
said to be “probable blast related injuries”. The prosecution sought
to prove all their assertion through direct, circumstantial, expert,
scientific, documentary, s. 27 evidence and the confession made
by the second accused to his superior.
[6]
In this protracted trial interspersed with two trial within a
trial (voir dires), other applications and several arguments by parties
on the specific issue, lasted for 165 days but not without the
court having to reschedule the trial of many other older cases.
The prosecution had called 84 witnesses out of 198 witnesses
listed on the list of witnesses forwarded to the court whereby 114
of whom were made available for the defence.
[7]
At the close of the case for the prosecution, it is observed
that the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution in this
case were not at all in the sequence and in the like manner of
‘constructing a house’. Whereas the submission made by counsels
for the defence and the reply by the prosecution were only on the
specific issue of fact and law. Hence, the narration of the factual
matrix of this case considering the volume of the notes of
proceeding together with 433 exhibits before the court, has been
both onerous and unassailable to say the least.

[8]
The deceased was a Mongolian woman named Altantuya
Shaariibuu, aged 28 and born eldest to Mr Shaariibuu Setev (SP2)
a doctor and professor of psychology at the National University
of Mongolia and Madam Altansetseg. According to SP2, the
deceased also known among family members and friends as ‘Amina’
was unmarried but lived in Mongolia with her two children. She
worked as a translator and often traveled out of Mongolia to
countries like China, Singapore, and Malaysia. She had come to
Malaysia a couple of time being the first in 1995 and the second
in early year of 2006.
[9]
On 8 October 2006, the deceased made her trip to
Malaysia again and this time she was accompanied by her maternal
second cousin Namiraa Gerelmaa (SP3) and a friend Urintuya
Gal Ochir (SP4). SP3 said while she and SP4 had wanted to
enquire about the English language study in Malaysia, the
deceased’s visit was to meet her boyfriend ‘Baginda’ (the third
accused).
[10] For this October 2006’s trip, all the three of them had
checked into Hotel Malaya, Jalan Hang Lekir, Kuala Lumpur. For
her mission of locating the third accused, the deceased had hired
a private investigator by the name Ang Chong Beng (SP5). SP5
had several times driven the deceased, SP3 and SP4 to the office
of the third accused at the 10th Floor of Bangunan Lembaga
Getah Asli, Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur and to his house at
Damansara Heights to see the third accused but to no avail. The
third accused had refused to see the deceased.

[11] On 19 October 2006 at about 1pm, the deceased
accompanied by SP4 lodged a police report against the third
accused and Balasubramaniam (SP1) the private investigator hired
by the third accused and SP1’s assistant, Suras alleging
harassment and threat by them for her life.
[12] On the same day, at about 7.20pm, the deceased, SP3 and
SP4 on their own had cruised through in front of the third
accused’s house in a hired taxi and after making a ‘U turn’, the
deceased had wished SP1 who was standing guard there a ‘Happy
Deepavali’. The deceased also asked SP1 if the third accused was
home. When SP1 replied in the negative, they left.

[13] Upon arrival at the Hotel Malaya and after having left SP3
and SP4 at the hotel, the deceased had decided to return alone
in the same taxi to the third accused’s house. According to SP3
and SP4, the deceased insisted that she might be able to see the
third accused if she were to return alone. Her said decision as it
turned out proved to be last time of her being seen by SP3 and
SP4.
[14] The next day, 20 October, SP3 with the assistance of
Ang Chong Beng (SP5) and the English speaking cousin of the
deceased, Burma Oyunchimeg @ Amy (SPG) who was then in
Hong Kong acting as a translator over the mobile phone for SP3
and SP5, had lodged a police report about the said disappearance
of the deceased.
[15] Police investigation ensued. On 7 November 2006, the
fragments of human bone and tissue were discovered in the
secluded spot in the forest area in Puncak Alam, Selangor (within
Lot Nos.: 12843 and 16735, Mukim Bukit Raja, Petaling) which
upon the DMA analysis proved to be one of Altantuya Shaariibuu.
What Transpired In Front Of The Third Accused’s House
On That Night Of 19 October
[16] What had transpired there could be seived from the
evidence, wherever relevant to this episode, of Balasubramaniam
(SP1) and of L/Corp. Rohaniza bt Roslan (SP7). Both SP1 and
SP7 were initially remanded by police under s. 117 CPC for the
purpose of investigation before subsequently released.
Evidence of Balasubramaniam (SP1)

G

H

I

[17] SP1 is employed as the private investigator since leaving
the police force in 1998. In early October 2006 through one
Margan from the lawyer’s office Dhiren, he was hired by the third
accused to protect the latter’s family from the threat and
harassment coming from the deceased. For such assignment he
was supposed to watch the third accused’s daughter, Rowena
going and coming back from school and to keep surveillance on
the movement of the deceased at Hotel Malaya.
[18] Balasubramaniam (SP1) said that for the job assigned to
him, he was assisted by one Suras and another. In the course of
his assignment, he came to know the deceased, SP3, SP4 and
SP5. He first came to know them when he met the deceased



368

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

with SP3, SP4 and SP5 at the lobby of the third accused’s office
on 9 October 2006 and prevented them from going to the
10th floor and again when they came the next day. He had also
forwarded several letters given to him by the deceased to the third
accused.

A

B

[19] According to SP1, since the deceased had known the third
accused person’s house address, he had arranged for the meeting
between the third accused and the lawyer, Dhiren at Restoran
Nagas at Brickfields and the other meeting at Pusat Bandar
Damansara together with one police officer, ASP Suresh for them
to set the plan of preventing the deceased from seeing the third
accused. Since ASP Suresh could not avail himself for the said
meeting, they had decided to extend SP1’s assignment to include
guarding the third accused’s house at night and to wait until the
deceased exhausted all her financial resources and had to return
to Mongolia.
[20] On the third or fourth day of his duty guarding the third
accused’s house, SP1 said he saw the deceased, SP3 and SP4
passing by the third accused’s house in a taxi.
[21] On 17 October 2006, at night, the deceased accompanied
by SP5 came again and created a scene at the front gate of the
third accused’s house by shouting ‘Razak bustard, you come out’.
SP1 then asked his assistant, Suras to call the police. The police
arrived and took the deceased away to the Brickfields Police
Station. SP1 and SP5 followed them to the same police station.
[22] At the police station, the deceased had wanted to lodge a
police report. SP1 told SP5 that the third accused did not want
any unwarranted publicity. SP5 then said that the deceased was
agreeable not to pursue with her report conditional upon the third
accused giving her USD500,000 and return ticket to Mongolia for
three persons.
[23] SP1 said that he had informed the third accused about
such demand of the deceased the next day 18 October 2006
after 12 noon and had also advised the third accused to lodge an
official police report against the deceased as to enable the police
to detain her and also to protect the safety of all his assistants.
The third accused, SP1 said had instead asked for the copy of
Identification Card of all his assistants for them to be handed over
to his police’s friends.

[24] On 19 October 2006, on his way to the third accused’s
house, SP1 received a phone call from the third accused who told
him that he was going out for the breaking of fast. Upon arrival
at the third accused’s house and after about ten minutes of him
standing guard in front of the third accused’s house, the deceased
with SP3 and SP4 had passed by him in a taxi and after the taxi
making a ‘U turn’, the deceased had wished him a ‘Happy
Deepavali’ and left. SP1 informed the third accused over the
phone about such presence of the deceased to which the third
accused told SP1 to keep on watching his house in case of the
deceased and her company coming again.
[25] At about half an hour later, the deceased came again in the
same taxi, but by that time she was alone. SP1 said in that well
lit area, he saw the deceased getting down from the taxi and
approached him. SP1 then called the third accused’s hand phone.
The third accused asked SP1 to keep on talking to the deceased
as the police was on their way to detain her. According to SP1,
it was the deceased who did most of the talking when she told
him about her mother was suffering from cancer and that her
father had passed away. The deceased was also said to have told
SP1 that she had lost her family’s apartment for the gambling
habit of her brother who had asked her to come down to
Malaysia and asked for money to redeem her said family’s
apartment. SP1 also said that the deceased had no money to pay
for their stay in Hotel Malaya.
[26] While listening to the deceased’s said story, the first
accused arrived in a red coloured private car of Proton Wira. The
first accused had asked SP1 whether he was Bala and while
pointing at the deceased had also asked SP1 “inikah perempuan
itu” (is this the said woman). Upon asked by the deceased as to
who the first accused was, SP1 said that the first accused was
the third accused’s relative. SP1 said that he had lied to the
deceased about the identity of the first accused person for fear
that the police would not be able to detain her. The first accused
then, according to SP1 was on his mobile phone somewhere
nearby. When the first accused came back to SP1 and told him
that he would be taking the deceased away, then only SP1 told
the deceased that the first accused was a police officer who came
to detain her. The deceased then walk on her own to the first
accused’s car and seated at the back seat.

[27] At about the same time, SP1 said that he saw one woman
who was seated at the front passenger’s seat of the first accused’s
car coming out and switching seats with another man who came
out from the back seat of the same car. The first accused then
entered into the driver’s seat.

A

B

[28] At that juncture, the male Chinese driver of the taxi with
which the deceased came in, one Ong Ah Hoon whom SP1
identified in court ... had approached SP1 for the RM150’s taxi
fares the deceased had promised him for his service of
transporting her there. SP1 asked Ong Ah Hoon to ask for the
said fares from the first accused, Ong Ah Hoon approached the
first accused and the first accused had paid him RM50/- before
driving away from the third accused’s house with the deceased in.
[29] SP1 then informed the third accused through his
handphone about the taking away of the deceased by the
first accused to which the third accused said ‘ok’. SP1 said from
that time until the next day, he had received several phone calls
from either SP3 or SP4 enquiring about the whereabout of the
deceased.
[30] The next day, 20 October 2006 at about 2 - 3pm, SP1
met the third accused at the letter’s office to ask for the balance
of the fees of his service. There, SP1 had asked the third accused
as to which police station was the deceased taken to. SP1 said
the third accused instead had asked him to guess himself. When
SP1 said that it could be Travers Police Station or SB’s lock-up
at Jalan Ipoh, the third accused in his usual smiling self said that
he himself had no idea about it as the police was yet to inform
him. SP1 further said that the third accused had asked him to
continue guarding his house at night until 26 October 2006 but
had relieved SP1 of his duty after 11pm on that 20 October 2006
to enable him to celebrate his Deepavali the next day.
[31] SP1 said that on his way back home after that 11pm,
20 October 2006, he had received a phone call from the
third accused telling him that there was a commotion in front of
his house. SP1 then returned to the third accused’s house and
had contacted the police on his way.

[32] Upon arrival at the front of the third accused’s house,
SP1 saw Ang Chong Beng (SP5), Namiiraa Gerelmaa (SP3) and
Urintuya Gal Ochir (SP4) were shouting and demanding for the
release of the deceased.
[33] Then, a police patrol car arrived. SP1 told the police
inspector and Sgt. Alias who came in the said patrol car that the
deceased was not being held up at the third accused’s house but
had been taken away by the first accused the day before. When
SP3, SP4 and SP5 had dispersed, SP1 informed the third accused
through his handphone to which the latter had asked SP1 to talk
about it the next day.
[34] The next day, SP1 together with the third accused and the
third accused’s father went to lodge a police report at Brickfields
Police Station about the said commotion staged by SP3, SP4 and
SP5.
[35] On 1 November 2006, SP1 was called to attend the
identification parade at the IPK Kuala Lumpur. In this ID parade
he had identified the first accused as the person who came and
took away the deceased on the night of 19 October 2006. At the
same IPK, SP1 was informed by DSP Gan Teck Guan (SP76)
that Altantuya had been murdered. SP1 then informed the
third accused about it. The third accused said he did not know
about it and that he would contact the superior police officer.

SP1 admitted that 012-2409311 was the number assigned to his
handphone and both 012-2132303 and 012-3916082 were the
phone numbers belonging to the third accused’s handphone.

handphone to the third accused’s handphone and one that he
received from the third accused’s handphone. They are in their

[38] Lans Corporal Rohaniza is a woman Lans Corporal
attached to Petaling Jaya’s District Police Headquarters. She is the
confidant of the first accused for nine years and was together with
him at the front of the third accused’s house on 19 October
2006.
[39] In her evidence, she said that on 19 October 2006, which
was the fasting month of Ramadhan, the first accused had after
work at about 6.45pm, fetched her and proceeded for the
breaking of fast at the Sri Thai Restaurant in Petaling Jaya. About
one hour later, they left the said restaurant for the first accused’s
office at Bukit Aman in her red Proton Wira Aeroback car bearing
the registration number of WNV 8523. The first accused drove
the car. At the said first accused’s office they had repacked things
for the first accused’s duty to escort PM or DPM to Hong Kong
had been cancelled.
[40] While packing, SP7 said the first accused had received a
handphone call. The first accused answered the call outside the
office and when he returned, he said that he had to meet a friend

at Damansara Heights and asked SP7 to wait for him in his office.
SP7 insisted to follow the first accused as the latter’s colleague
was sleeping there inside the office.
[41] The first accused in his T-Shirt and jean drove SP7’s car
to Damansara Heights. SP7 followed along. Upon arrival in front
of a double storey bungalow’s house at a place then not known
to her, (the third accused’s house) SP7 said the first accused had
pulled up the car without turning off the engine. There, SP7 saw
one male Indian talking to one female Chinese at a distance of
six to seven meter from her car. SP7 identified the photograph of
Altantuya the deceased (exhs. P8 and P20) as the said female
Chinese.
[42] The first accused alighted from the car and had
approached the said male Indian. After a while the first accused
had walked away on his mobile phone for about ten minutes
before coming to the car and asked SP7 to sit at the back. SP7
came out from the front seat and sat at the back. At about the
same time, the deceased whom she saw earlier talking to male
Indian came in and sat next to her. The first accused then came
and sat at the driver’s seat.
[43] SP7 said, as they were about to drive off, a man wearing
a green cap appeared and sat in the front passenger’s seat. Then
a taxi driver approached the first accused and said that the
deceased had yet to pay his taxi fares. The first accused gave him
RM50 and drove the car away.

Where Was The Deceased Taken To
[44] According to SP7, upon approaching at the junction not far
away from the third accused’s house, the man in green cap asked
the first accused to pull up the car by saying “Tuan, berhenti
dekat simpang”. The man in green cap walked out from the car
towards one dark green Vitara 4WD car parked underneath the
tree. The said man got into the said Vitara and drove off passing
infront of her car. The first accused then followed the same Vitara.
SP7 identified the photograph of Suzuki CAC 1883 (exh. P25(1)
- (6)) as similar to the said Vitara.
[45] SP7 said while in a car, the first accused advised the
deceased in English not to create any scene at En Razak’s house
as En Razak has family and that she should see En Razak at his
office if she had problems with him.

[46] SP7 further said that both the first accused and the man
in green cap stopped their car along a highway towards Bukit
Aman. The first accused had walked out from the car and got
into the said Vitara for a while before coming back to her car. In
the meantime, SP7 had shifted seat by sitting at the front seat of
the car. At that juncture the deceased had asked her who they
were to which the first accused said “we are police”.
[47] The man in green cap drove his Vitara. The first accused
followed behind. On their way, SP7 had asked the first accused
where was he taking the deceased to. The first accused responded
that she was to be sent back to hotel. When SP7 said that she
could not follow along as she had an earlier appointment with her
friends, the first accused said that they would only then follow the
said Vitara.
[48] Upon arrival at UTK’s office at Bukit Aman, both the man
in green cap in the Vitara and first accused pulled up without
turning off the engine. The first accused walked towards the
Vitara and talked to the man in a green cap before coming back
to SP7’s car. The first accused then opened the door of the seat
where the deceased was seated. The female Chinese got out of
the car and the first accused talked to her for a while. They both
then walked towards Vitara seat. The first accused opened the
front passenger’s door of the Vitara for the deceased. The said
Vitara then left Bukit Aman through gate A with the said
deceased in it.

[49] The first accused according to SP7 did not get into the
said Vitara but had instead asked her to drive her car for the
appointment that she had. She then drove her car alone leaving
Bukit Aman. At the same time, she said that she saw the first
accused was walking towards the UTK’s office. According to SP7,
on her way home from Bukit Aman at about 9pm she was in
contact over the handphone with the first accused. She asked the
first accused where he was. The first accused said that he was
still at Bukit Aman. Upon reaching home, SP7 with her friend
PC Ros Aliza and Nor Azean proceeded to the Las Vegas
Karaoke in Bukit Bintang Kuala Lumpur. When she was there
after 11pm, SP7 said the first accused had called her over the
handphone and asked her to fetch him at either Jalan Duta or
Rawang’s Tol Complex. She did not immediately proceed to fetch

the first accused as requested until she realized there were three
missed calls from the first accused in her handphone before the
first accused called again and asked her to go to UTK, Bukit
Aman.
[50] SP7 drove to Bukit Aman and upon reaching UTK’s office
after 12 midnight, she did not get to meet the first accused. She
rang him up and the first accused asked her to wait for him for
he was then with his friend. SP7 fell asleep inside her car for
about ten minutes before the first accused came and knocked on
the screen of her car and requested her to help him carrying his
bags and hanger. According to SP7, the first accused was then in
a different dress from one she last saw him wearing when they
came back from the third accused’s house in Damansara. The first
accused said that he had to meet his friend when SP7 asked what
held him up for turning up late.
[51] From Bukit Aman, SP7 sent the first accused to Putrajaya
and left him there at about 1am on the 20 October 2006 before
she returned home. Upon reaching home she had called the first
accused informing him about her having reached home.

The Behaviour Of The First Accused After 20 October 2006
[53] SP7 said after that 20 October 2006 she had met the first
accused several times including one during hari raya where she
met the parents of the first accused at Sg Pelek, Sepang.
According to SP7, while in his parent’s house, the first accused
was not in his usual self. On their way back to Putrajaya from
Sg Pelek, she did not ask the first accused about the female
Chinese but only asked him why was he unusually quiet, to which
the first accused said he was worried about the female Chinese
whom they had picked up the night before and said he was
puzzled as to how the said female Chinese had suddenly
disappeared.
[54] According to SP7, two or three days thereafter, she had
called both the Travers and Brickfield’s Police Station enquiring
from them whether there was any case of a sudden death report
on a foreign female Chinese or of her being kidnapped and raped.
Impeachment On SP7

F

G

H

I

[55] So smooth and plain the evidence of SP7 it may appear to
be, but her credibility sought to be impeached by the prosecution
premised upon her contradiction of her oral evidence in court with
her s. 112’s statement given to police. They are as follows:
(1) In her evidence she maintained that the first accused did not
get into the Vitara car and left Bukit Aman with the deceased
and the man in green cap whereas in her statement, she said
the first accused did get into the same car;
(2) In her evidence she said that on the way to Putrajaya from
Sg Pelek, she did not ask the first accused about the woman
while in her statement she said she asked four times;
(3) In her evidence she said the first accused replied that he was
puzzled as to how the woman suddenly disappeared when she
asked the first accused why he appeared so worried whereas
in her statement she said the first accused said “tidak apaapalah” (nothing happened) when asked;



378

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

(4) In her evidence that she enquired from police station whether
there was any foreign Chinese woman lodged a report of
kidnapping or rape whilst in her statement said she enquired
about kidnapping or killed; and
(5) In he evidence she said the first accused called her and asked
her to pick him up at Rawang or Jalan Duta Toll Plaza. While
in her statement she said it was either Sg Buloh or Jalan
Duta Plaza.
[56] SP7 when asked to explain about the said contradictions
said as to number (1) above that she was confused and pressured
into saying in her statement that was recorded after her release
from the 14 days remand and the first accused get into the said
car and that she was so depressed then as she was help up in a
hotel and was not allowed to meet anyone. As to number (2)
above, her simple explanation was that she could not remember
what she said in her statement. As to number (3) above, she
maintained that when the first accused said he was puzzled about
the said Chinese woman sudden disappearance and said “tidak
apa-apalah” meant the same thing. As to number (4) above, she
said that she could not remember whether the recording officer did
ask about her enquiry on that woman being raped and to number
(5), she said that when the first accused asked her over her
handphone to pick him up at the toll, it was so noisy as she was
then in a karaoke lounge and could not figure out the toll as
referred to by the first accused of either Sg Buloh or Jalan Duta,
but did not know why did she say ‘Rawang Toll’ in court.
[57] In her cross examination by counsel, SP7 said that she was
confused as there were many statements recorded from her by
different recording officers. She further said while on remand she
was abused and promised to be released if she were to agree to
say that the first accused did get into the car.
[58] I must admit, quite contrary to many other cases of
impeachment on the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses that
I have come across both the counsels for the first accused and
the third accused urged the court to accept the explanation of
SP7 as being both satisfactory and reasonable or alternatively to
accept the other part of her evidence even if she were to be
impeached. I have reserved my ruling on her impeachment until
after the hearing of all the other evidence of the prosecution.

Identity Of The Deceased

[59] I have no reason to doubt the credibility and reliability of
all the prosecution’s witnesses with regard to the recovery of
fragments of human bone and tissue in the said forest area in
Puncak Alam, the handling of those bones to the hospital and,
the reconstruction of them into a human structure. I also have no
reason to doubt the reliability and the accuracy of the DNA
analysis done on all those bone, hair and tissue which led to the
conclusion that they belong to Altantuya.

F

[60] The evidence was adduced that those fragment of bones
and tissue were collected by a team comprises of a Crime Scene
Investigation Unit headed by Supt Amidon (SP58) and the
Ballistic Unit headed by DSP Mohamad Koey (SP59) and Dog
Unit (K9) under the supervision of Dr Mohd Shah, the Forensic
Pathologist (SP70). Those bones and tissue which have been
systematically labeled were handed over to ASP Tonny Ak
Lunggan, the investigating officer (SP75) and handed them on two
occasions to Dr Mohd Shah.
[61] At Hospital Kuala Lumpur, both Dr Mohd Shah and
Dr Nurliza, the Forensic Consultant and Anthropologist (SP72)
had reconstructed those highly fragmented bones into a human
structure (vide photo P 377) and confirmed that save for one
non-human bone, they matched the remains of an individual.
According to Dr Nurliza, in view of metric of the humorous, pelvis,
scapula and clavicle bones, the remains was 89% - 91%
probability of an adult woman. Dr Nurliza further of the view on
the auricular surface, the estimated age of the said woman was
between 24 - 35.

[62] Dr Mohd Shah had also took the specimen swabs from the
same bone fragment, tissues and hairs and had them sent by the
investigating officer to the Chemistry Department, Petaling Jaya for
DNA analysis.

[63] The Director of Forensic Division of the Chemistry
Department, Petaling Jaya, Mr Primulapathi (SP39) upon analyzing
on the these specimen confirmed that the deceased was the
biological daughter of Setev Shaariibuu and S Altansetseg. SP39
also analysed some samples of hairs (Z11A) from P170B (Z11)
which he had used up during analysis and found mt DNA profile
of the deceased on Z11A.

The Cause Of Death
[64] Dr Mohd Shah after having examined the remains certified
that the cause of death was “probable blast related injuries”. The
ballastic expert DSP Muhamad Koey (SP59) who was in the
search team together with Dr Mohd Shah confirmed that there
was a blast of high explosive at the scene where those highly
fragmented bones were collected. En Shaari (SP40), the head with
Firearms and Tool Marks Unit with the Chemistry Department,
Petaling Jaya who examined the exhibits collected at the scene
and found some high explosive substance on some hair sample

The Confession
[65] The prosecution sought to introduce the “confession” of
the second accused purportedly made voluntarily to ACP Mastor
bin Mohd Arif (SP11) the then Commander of Unit Tindakan
Khas (UTK). SP11 said on the 4 November 2006, he was
directed by Deputy Commander II, Crime Investigation
Department, Dato’ Syed Ismail to go and bring back the second
accused who was then on duty escorting the honorable
Prime Minister for his official visit to Pakistan. Enroute their flight
to KLIA after a transit in Bangkok, ACP Mastor said the
second accused had confessed to his involvement in this case.
This part of SP11 evidence of was spontaneously objected to by
the entire team of defence on the ground that such alleged
confession being involuntarily made. The court had then embarked
on the voir dire to determine on the issue of the admissibility of
such alleged confession.
[66] At the end of the voir dire, it was argued on behalf of the
second accused that the alleged confession was inadmissible for
want of statutory caution under s. 26 and s. 113 of Criminal
Procedure Code (CPC) administered by ACP Mastor when the
second accused was clearly then under his custody and that he
had prior knowledge about the second accused’s involvement in
this case when he told the latter that “cerita ini telah terdedah
dan tidak ada apa-apa nak disembunyikan” (this story has been
exposed and there is nothing to hide).
[67] ACP Mastor in his cross examination admitted that the
second accused was under his custody and care throughout the
journey from Pakistan to Malaysia and that he would arrest the
second accused if the latter tried to escape at the two places of
transit in Lahore and Bangkok.

Brown J in Sambu v. Rex [1946] 1 LNS 30 said:

There is nothing technical about being in custody. A person is in
custody when he is in a state of being guarded and watched to
prevent his escape. In order to answer the question of whether
the appellant was in custody at the time when he is alleged to
have made the statement, it is only necessary to consider what
would have happened, if at that time he had tried to run away ...

[69] In Privy Council case of Shaaban & Ors v. Chong Fook Kam
& Anor [1969] 1 LNS 170 it was held:
C

An arrest occurs when a police officer states in terms that he is
arresting or when he uses force to restrain the individual
concerned. It occurs also when by words or conduct he makes it
clear that he will, if necessary, use force to prevent the individual
from going where he may want to go ...

[70] But Augustine Paul in his book of ‘Practice and Procedure,

That however is not meant as a general test. The word must not
be detached from their context and read as applicable in all
circumstances. The must be read as governed and qualified by
the particular facts of the case in which they occur.

[71] Now, in our case today, it must be remembered that the
second accused was not in Pakistan for his personal reason such
being on vacation but was on official duty of escorting the
Honourable Prime Minister for his official visit to Pakistan.
Therefore there is nothing sinister about his return flight ticket had
been reserved for him by ACP Mastor. To my mind, to conclude
that the second accused was then under arrest or police custody
simply because the backpack was put on the second accused and
that he being escorted to go to toilet at the place of transit is
stretching too far. Where and what else could the second accused
do in Pakistan when his duty had been relieved? I am therefore
of the view that the second accused was not then under the
arrest or custody of police within the definition of which as
envisaged in s. 26 and s. 113 of CPC. Hence the question of
ACP Mastor ‘having’ failed to administer the ‘statutory caution’ as
contended by the learned counsel for the second accused does
not arise.

Voluntariness Of The Confession

A

[72] The law with regard to confession to a person in authority
is governed by s. 24 of the Evidence Act, which reads:
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a
criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to
the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or
promise having reference to the charge against the accused
person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in
the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds
which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by
making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of
temporal nature in reference to proceeding against him.

[73] As oppose to s. 26 of Evidence Act, whereby confession
by the accused while in custody of police could only be proved if
it is made in the immediate presence of a Session Judge or
Magistrate, a confession to a person in authority under s. 24 of
the same Act has no reference to the accused being under arrest
or in the custody of the police.
[74] It is trite law that the onus is for the prosecution to prove
that the alleged confession was made voluntarily without any
threat, promise, inducement and oppression. The majority decision
of the Federal Court in Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s v. PP &
Another Appeal case [2004] 3 CLJ 737 in dealing with the
confession of the second appellant in that case had quoted with
approval the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Chan Ming Cheng
v. PP [2002] 4 CLJ 77 in that there is no burden on an accused
person to prove that the statement recorded from him is
involuntarily. The burden lies on the prosecution to show
positively that the statement was voluntarily given. So long as the
suspicion is reasonable as to the voluntariness of the statement, it
is incumbent on the trial judge to hold it inadmissible.
[75] In the House of Lord case of Director of PP v. Ping Lin
[1975] 3 All ER 175, it was held:
where an objection was raised in criminal proceedings to the
admission of an alleged confession by the accused, the onus was
on the prosecution to satisfy the judge beyond reasonable doubt
that the statement in question had been made voluntarily by
showing that it had not been obtained either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage excited or held out by a person in authority.
The judge had to determine the issue as one of fact and

causation, ie, whether the crown had proved that the statement
had not been made as a result of something said or done by a
person in authority. It was not sufficient for the crown to shown
that the person in authority had not intended to extract a
confession or that there had been no impropriety on his part.
What was necessary was to show, as a matter of fact, that the
statement in question had not been obtained in consequence of
something said or done by him which amounted to an express
or implicit threat or promise to the accused.

[76] In Hasibullah Mohd Ghazali v. PP [1993] 4 CLJ 535, the
Supreme Court quoted with approval the judgment of
R v. Richards [1967] 1 All ER 829 which held:
Whatever be the nature of the inducement so made however
trivial it may seem to the average man to have been, such an
inducement will be least capable of rendering the statement then
made inadmissible.

[77] Now, ACP Mastor in his evidence at the voir dire admitted
that enroute KLIA on the plane from Bangkok he had arranged
both Sgt. Jelina and Corp. Zamri who accompanied him for his
said mission to bring back the second accused, to “sandwich” the
second accused sitting in between them. As preplanned,
ACP Mastor moved to sit next to the second accused once both
Sgt. Jelina and Corp. Zamri shifted their seat for him to tell the
second accused the true reason why he was required to be
brought back to Malaysia. ACP Mastor admitted that he had then
informed the second accused of the true reason of him being
relieved of his duty and that was, the second accused was known
to be involved in the murder of Altantuya and said he had asked
the second accused in the following words:
Saya bertanya dan mengharapkan jawapan daripada Tertuduh
(Sirul Azhar). Saya bertanya dan meminta beliau menceritakan hal
sebenar. Saya kata cerita ini telah terdedah dan Azilah telah
memberitahu cerita sebenar dan tidak ada apa-apa yang nak
disembunyikan. Sirul Azhar agak lambat memberikan response
iaitu dalam 2-3 minit. Dalam masa 2-3 minit tersebut saya
bercadang untuk bertanya beliau lagi jika beliau tidak response
selepas 2-3 minit tersebut ...

[78] It is clear from ACP Mastor’s own words as aforesaid that
he did not only inform the second accused of the actual reason
of him required to be brought back to Malaysia but went beyond
that by asking the second accused to tell him the truth
(“menceritakan hal sebenar”). Clearly to my mind that his act of



384

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

wanting the second accused to tell him the truth about this case
went far beyond what he was assigned to by Dato’ Syed Ismail,
the Director of Criminal Investigation.
[79] The second accused himself said at voir dire that he had
regarded the said questioning by ACP Mastor in his commanding
tone as an ‘order’ from his superior for him to answer, failing
which a disciplinary action might be taken against him and that his
mind was so confused as he had earlier being informed of a matter
involving his wife as the reason for him being relieved of his duty.
[80] Now, what needs to be asked is, would the second
accused being an ‘operative’ in UTK proceed to confess of his
involvement in this case, had he not be so “ordered” by
ACP Mastor, his superior?. Further, would the second accused
likewise responded to ACP Mastor had it not for his words
“cerita ini sudah terdedah, Azilah telah memberitahu cerita sebenar,
dan tidak ada apa yang nak disembunyikan”. (This story (this
case) has been exposed. Azilah has revealed the actual story and
there is nothing to hide).
[81] Voluntary in ordinary parlance means of one’s own free will
(R v. Rennie). In the case of PP v. Naikan [1960] 1 LNS 87, it
was held:
the words “you better tell the truth” and equivalent expressions
have acquired a fixed meaning as if a technical term and have
always been held to impart a threat or promise.

C

D

[82] In the case of PP v. Law Say Seck & Ors [1970] 1 LNS
114, it was held:
One should be able to say that without it, the person would not
have made a statement. The inducement, threat or promise need
not be express but may be implied from the circumstances of the
case. If for example a person in authority says that the truth has come
out and that every one knows about it and tells the accused that he better
says what he knows, this itself may amount to an inducement and
threat.

[83] The learned DPP implored upon the court to adopt the
approach taken by the court in Singapore as decided in the cases
of Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v. PP and Panya Martmontree where it
was held:

G

D

PP v. Azilah Hadri & Ors

385

more recently, however, it has been held that the question
whether words to the effect “you had better tell the truth” import
a threat and inducement should be approached in a common sense
way and in the context of the individual case. Thus, where a
police officer reminded a witness that he should tell the truth and
not tell lies, that did not constitute a threat or inducement.

[84] To my mind, with respect, the approach as was taken in
the said Chai Chien Wei Kelvin and Panya Martmotree’s case (supra)
must be seen in the context of the fact of those cases. Further, if
the words “you had better tell the truth” must be approached in
a common sense way as aforesaid I find it difficult to adopt the
same approach for the words “cerita ini sudah terdedah, tiada apa
yang nak disembunyikan”.
[85] For the forgoing reasons, without having to unnecessarily
dwell on the lengthy list of cases on the exclusionary discretion
that is applicable in the United Kingdom and the Civil Aviation
Act, I am of the firm view that there was an obvious inducement
and threat inflicted by ACP Mastor in procuring the said
confession from the second accused. It is a clear case of the
alleged confession being actuated by fear in the mind of the
second accused exacted by ACP Mastor.
Accordingly the alleged confession is held to be involuntarily made
and inadmissible as evidence.

Information Leading To The Discovery Of Facts
(against the first accused)
[86] Next, the prosecution sought to introduce the evidence of
the information leading to the discovery of fact purportedly made
by the first accused to Ch. Insp. Koh Fei Cheow (SP20).
[87] According to SP20 on 6 November 2006 at about 5.20pm
he took the first accused out form the lock-up to his office at IPK
Kuala Lumpur while interviewing him, the first accused was said
to have informed him “dia boleh membawa saya untuk cuba
mencari tempat kejadian perempuan Mongolia dibunuh tetapi OKT
tidak tahu tentang nama kawasan dan kurang pasti lokasi tempat
kejadian”. Following this information SP20 with his three other
personnels and the first accused left IPK Kuala Lumpur in police’s
Pajero WKN 7008 proceeded towards the scene led by the first
accused. According to SP20 on their way to the scene they had
to pull over several times as the first accused himself was not
certain of the route before arriving at the scene at secluded spot



386

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

in the forest area in Puncak Niaga Ampangan Tasik Subang
Selangor at about 6.50pm. There according to SP20, the first
accused told him “Inilah tempatnya perempuan Mongolia
diletupkan” and “Inilah tempat perempuan Mongolia ditembak”.
These informations according to SP20 were recorded in his
investigation diary.
[88] The prosecution sought to admit these informations under
s. 27 of Evidence Act. These are plethora of cases that discussed
on the true application of s. 27. It is trite, that s. 27 is based on
the view that if a fact is actually discovered in consequence of
information given some guarantee is afforded thereby that the
information is true, but the foremost condition to that is that the
police must not have prior knowledge of the same information
supplied by the accused.
[89] In Federal Court case of Francis Antonysamy v. PP [2005]
2 CLJ 481; [200] 3 MLJ 389, it was held:
(3) Section 27 is independent and is not subject to the
voluntariness rule in s. 24. However, information supplied under
s. 27, which had been found to be involuntary may be excluded
by the court in the exercise of its discreation (Goi Ching Ang v.
PP [1999] 1 CLJ 829 followed). The party that is seeking to have
evidence excluded is the exercise of the discretion of the court has
the onus of showing, on the balance of probabilities, that the
discretion should be exercised in its favour.

At p. 499, Augustine Paul JCA delivering judgment for the Federal
Court said:
Since voluntariness is not a condition of admissibility of
information supplied under s. 27 the privilege against self
incriminating which is manifested in an involuntary statement or
in a statement made in breach of the requirements of s. 112 must
be deemed to have been impliedly abrogated insofar as s. 27 is
concerned ...

And at para. 32 of his judgment, Augustine Paul JCA has made a
reference to the case of PP v. Mohd Farid Mohd Sukis & Anor
[2002] 8 CLJ 814, which quoted Kerry Stephens who in his book
entitled Voir Dire at p. 58 says:
It follows that the party seeking the exclusion of the evidence
must satisfy the court that the circumstances are such that the
court should exercise its discretion in favour of the party making

the application. The appropriate way of dealing with an application
of this nature is by way of a trial within a trial (see Smith v. R
[1957] 97 CLR 100; R v. Bradshaw [1978] 18 SASR 83;
R v. Dugan [1984] 2 NSWLR 554 Street CJ expresses the view
that a judge, in considering an application of this nature ...
‘must necessarily act upon such evidence as is placed before him
either in the substantive trial or on the voir dire or both’.

[90] Guided by the ruling enunciated in the Francis
Anthonysamy’s case, I have granted the application made by the
learned counsel for the first and the second accused to have
voir dire in favour of excluding the said evidence of the said
informations under s. 27 by the first accused which I had on
11 June 2008 ruled to be admissible as evidence.
[91] The voir dire was conducted towards the end of the trial
after which the prosecution closed its case. The first accused
himself testified in the said voir dire. In his evidence, he said he
did not make the said statement and did not lead police party to
the discovery of the scene at Puncak Alam. He further, said that
the police party took him to the said scene against his will and
that the police had obtained the information from other sources
that was the telephone call logs and that he was brought to the
said scene led and guided by a brown coloured Pajero.
[92] Since the prosecutions closed its case immediately after the
conclusion of the said voir dire, the decision on the exclusion of
the said evidence of s. 27 was reserved until after the submission
by both parties is heard together with the main submission at the
end of the prosecution’s case.
Evidence Of ‘Conduct’ Under s. 8, Evidence Act

G

H

I

[93] The prosecution also sought to admit through
ASP Zulkarnain bin Samsudin (SP23) the words of the second
accused while pointing at the particular spot at the scene to the
effect “Itulah tempat perempuan itu diletupkan”, under s. 8,
Evidence Act. According to SP23 on 6 November 2006, at about
5.30pm, he had followed a team of police led by ASP Tonny
together with the second accused to the scene. Upon arrival at
the scene, he saw Ch. Insp. Koh Fei Cheow was already there
with the first accused. SP23 said as all of them got down from
his Pajero, the second accused pointed to him at one bushy spot
nearby and said at the same time “Itulah tempat perempuan itu



388

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

diletupkan”. The prosecution while conceding that such words was
not an information under s. 27 but contended that it was a
statement coupled with the act of pointing to or showing, hence
admissible under s. 8, Evidence Act, ie, the proviso to explanation
I.

A

B

[94]

The explanation I, under s. 8 of the Evidence Act reads:

The word ‘conduct’ in this section does not include statements
unless those statements accompany and explain acts other than
statement ...
C

[95] In Syamo Maha Patro & Anor v. Emperor [1932] AIR
Madras 391, Pandalai J expresses his personal view about the
possibility of recognizing the statement admissible under s. 8
explaining conduct which is itself admissible, from another class of
exceptions like those which fall under s. 27. Nevertheless, in view
of the other evidence in that case he himself set aside and omitted
from consideration the evidence of ‘conduct’ in that case.
[96]

On the contrary, Reilly J in the same case said:

Statement admissible under that s. 27 can still be proved, but all
other statements of accused persons made to the police in the
course of investigation are shut out.

[97] The facts in Syamo’s case may compendiously be put as
follows:
The appellant upon being questioned, told sub. Inspector
something (which on the ruling of the Full Banch must be
excluded from evidence) and then took police to his house. The
appellant also made a statement (which must be excluded for the
same reason) and then gave up some jewellery which had been
identified as that which the deceased had been wearing when she
disappeared. Afterwords, both of the appellant led police to a tank
where appellant pointed out some long grass, in which the
deceased was found.

[98]

D

Waller J in the same case at p. 403:

Through the statements made by the appellants are inadmissible,
evidence of their conduct is certainly admissible under s. 8 of
Evidence Act. I accept that evidence as true and find it proved
that the first appellant took the sub Inspector to the second
appellant’s house, that second appellant gave up the murdered
girl’s jewel and that first appellant pointed out the place where the
body was found.

[99] Here, I observed that such admission of evidence of
conduct is only relates to the evidence of conduct simpliciter that
is the bare act of showing at or of pointing out or of leading to
the discovery of fact without more.
[100] In the case of Prakash Chand v. State (Delhi Admn) [1979]
AIR SC 400, it was held at p. 333:
What is excluded by S. 162 CPC is the statement made to a
police officer in the course of police investigation and not the
evidence relating to the conduct of an accused persons (not
amounting to a statement) when confronted or questioned by a
police officer during the course of investigation. For example, the
evidence of the circumstances simpliciter, that an accused person
led a police officer and pointed out the place where stolen articles
or weapons which might have been used in the commission of the
offence were found hidden would be admissible as conduct under
s. 8 of Evidence Act, irrespective of whether any statement by
the accused contemporaneously with or antecedent to such
conduct falls within the purview of s. 27 of the Evidence Act.

[101] Back home, Augustine Paul J (as he then was) in the case
of PP v. Hashim Hanafi [2003] 8 CLJ 555 said at p. 191F:
The question that PW4 (police officer) asked the accused at the
scene was whether he had any incriminating articles in his custody
and control. The response of the accused was his act of pointing
out at exh. P7 to PW4 by signs. The act was merely a response
to a question to the question that was asked and not a direct
answer to it. Thus the interpretation to be accorded to the act of
the accused is that it does not mean that he agreed with the
question. The information that is admissible against him is
therefore only his bare act of pointing out the dangerous drug to
PW4. It amounts to the evidence of conduct. Where an accused
produces the weapon of attack or points out the place of its
concealment his conduct itself is tantamount to making a statement
or conveying information and is admissible under s. 27 of
Evidence Act. (emphasis added).

[102] The Court of Appeal in Bala Matik v. PP [2006]
2 CLJ 229, ruled “that the law clearly permits such evidence of
pointing to the parang as shown in P32D without more to be
admitted as conduct under s. 8 of Evidence Act (emphasis added).
[103] From the above cases referred to as can clearly be seen the
evidence of conduct that was admitted in both cases of Hashim
Hanafi and Bala Matik (supra) is only the bare act of pointing out,

without more. Although in Prakash Chand’s case (supra) it was held
that “irrespective of whether any statement by the accused
contemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct falls within
the purview of s. 27 of the Evidence Act, but the prosecution
themselves in the present case, conceded that the said statement
of the second accused is not admissible under s. 27, and rightly
so, as the same scene was already by then discovered upon the
information led by the first accused. I am not therefore prepared
to consider the said statement made by the second accused as
evidence of conduct under s. 8 of the Evidence Act and it is
therefore inadmissible.

Information Leading To The Discovery Of Fact
(against the second accused)
[104] The prosecution again sought to introduce the evidence of
information leading to the discovery of fact and this time
purportedly made by the second accused to Ch. Insp. Koh Fei
Cheow (SP20) and ASP Zulkarnain bin Samsudin (SP23).
[105] According to SP20, on 7 November 2006 at about 2pm he
together with SP23 interviewed the second accused in SP23’s
office at IPK Kuala Lumpur. In the course of interviewing him,
SP20 said the second accused had told him and SP23 certain
information relating to the jewellery of the deceased.
[106] SP23 reading from his police report (exh. P76) which
contains the said information said, the second accused told him
“Saya boleh tunjukkan barang kemas milik perempuan (xxxxx), ada
saya simpan di dalam rumah saya di Kota Damansara.“(The
sentence in xxxxx has been mutually agreed by the prosecution
and defence to be excluded for being highly prejudicial)
[107] SP23 said after he adduced the said information into his
police report (exh. P76) he had arranged for the Unit Pemusnah
Bom (The Bomb Disposal Unit) to assist in searching the second
accused’s house. He also informed DSP Gan upon which
DSP Gan told him that the key to the second accused’s house
was kept by the UTK unit, Bukit Aman and that he would
arrange for the said key to be taken to Kota Damansara.
[108] SP23 then together with SP20 and his personnel
proceeded to Kota Damansara guided by the second accused.
Upon arrival at the car park of Apartment Block 5, Jalan Chamar
4/1, Gugusan Semarak seksyen 4, Kota Damansara, they met

DSP Yusri and the other personnels from the UTK. According to
SP20, Sgt. Rosli from the said UTK handed over a bunch of key
(exh. P36) to the second accused’s house to him before he
passed it over to SP23.
[109] The second accused them led SP23 and his team together
with the Bomb Disposal Unit to his house of No. 5-3-7 at the
third floor. Guided by the second accused SP23 used the key to
the pad lock attached to the grill and the wooden door of the said
house. Inside the house, SP23 said, the second accused led his
team to his unlocked room and taking out from inside the
unlocked cupboard in his room, a black jacket. According to
SP23, while taking the said jacket out, the second accused told
him “saya simpan barang kemas di dalam jacket”. Acting on this
information SP23 searched the jacket and discovered from inside
its pocket, a lady wrist watch of ‘Larmens’ brand with the series
number of 940004B (exh. P16B), a pair of earring with one of
which was without the stud (exh. P17B) and one gold ring
(exh. P18B).
[110] SP23 further added that he had placed all those three
items he discovered on the bed and asked the second accused
“Adakah ini barang-barang kemas yang dimaksudkan?”; to which
the second accused nodded his head and pointing his finger at the
same items and contemporaneously said “inilah barang dia”. (as
shown in photograph – exh. P60I)
[111] As the relevant information that have been recorded as
forming part of the evidence, similarly as in the case of the alleged
s. 27 evidence against the first accused, the defence team sought
the court to exercise its discretion to exclude the said
informations. I have similarly allowed the said request.
[112] In a voir dire, the second accused himself testified and had
called Sgt. Rosli and DSP Yusri to testify for him. The second
accused in his evidence essentially claimed that he never gave such
information relating to the jewellery of the deceased, to SP20 and
SP23. On the contrary, the second accused claimed that it was
SP23 who told him the following words, that is “Macam inilah
Sirul, kalau engkau setuju, engkau ikut aku, kau camkan
barang-barang itu, kau pegang dan tunjuk ke arah barang itu
sambil camera man ambil gambar”. According to the second
accused SP23 also said that he would help him not to have his
case brought to court. It was only, then SP23 and the police
team took him to his house at No. 5-3-7, Kota Damansara. The



392

[2012] 1 CLJ

second accused further contended that set of key (P36) that SP23
used to unlock the padlock and grill to his house is not his set of
keys which he had passed over to Supt. Mastor onboard the flight
from Bangkok to KLIA.
[113] The second accused again said that inside his room his
house, SP23 had forced him to hold one black jacket for the
purpose of him being photograph twice. SP23 then took out some
items from inside the same jacket and placed them in the bed
before forcing him to point by his finger at all those items again
for the purpose of photographic.

Impeachment On DSP Yusri
[114] In the course of this voir dire, the prosecution sought to
impeach the credibility of DSP Yusri (TWD3) who testified for the
second accused on account of his oral evidence clearly
contradicted his 112’s statement (exh. P100). The said oral
evidence that is said to be in conflict with the highlighted parts of
his 112’s statement are as follows:
(1) He said that he did not see the second accused being taken
into his room whilst in his statement he said he was not sure.

D

E

(“Saya tidak nampak tertuduh kedua dibawa masuk ke dalam
biliknya”)
(2) He said that he was sure that when D9 was searching the
second accused’s room, the second accused was not in the
said room whilst in his statement he said that he was not sure.
(“Saya pasti yang tertuduh kedua tidak berada di dalam bilik
semasa pasukan D9 membuat pemeriksaan”)
(3) He said that it was not true that he was allowed to search
the second accused’s room after D9 had completed their
search of the same whilst in his statement he said that he only
entered the second accused’s room after D9 had completed
their search.

(4) He said that he was not sure when Unit Pemusnah Bom
entered to carry out their task whilst in his statement he said
Unit Pemusnah Bom entered to search after D9.
(“Tidak pasti Unit Pemusnah Bom hanya masuk ke bilik
tersebut kemudian selepas pasukan D9 membuat pemeriksaan”)
[115] DSP Yusri (TWD3) in explaining the said contradiction said
he was nervous and flustered as he had never given evidence in
court being this was the first time in his 16 years of service in the
DTK and PPH (Pasukan Polis Hutan). He further explained that
he could not really recollect of what he has said in his statement
as his statement was recorded only on 2 August 2007 for the
event that took place on 7 November 2006. Again, he explained
that he did not really pay particular attention of what took place
in the said second accused’s house as his duty then was just to
collect the official items of UTK form the second accused.
[116] The ruling on both these evidence of s. 27 and on the
impeachment was reserved. The former subject to the submission
of parties and the letter subject to the hearing of all the other
witnesses for the prosecution.
Call Logs

[117] In the course of conducting the trial of this case, much
time was spent on the evidence of call logs, ie, the call
transactions between the first accused, the second accused and
the third accused that had been recorded in the system of two
different telcos namely Celcom and Maxis. These evidence came
through Syed Mustaqim bin Syed Yusoff (SP26) the IT Analyst
with Celcom, Mohd Firdaous bin Mohd Omar (SP61) the
executive in the special project and Investigation of Celcom, Haizal
bin Hambali (SP63) the Technical Specialist with Celcom and
Nik Kamarudin bin Nik Ka (SP64) the GM Core Network
Operation, Celcom. Through these witnesses this court was
referred to thousand of data contained in exhs. P370, P27
exhs. P375 and P12 under the specific column called LAC (Local
Area Code), SAC (Service Area Code), cell ID call type MOT and
Voice MTC in respect of two switches, ie, 2G and 3G. An
example of 3G would be MSSC (C1) while GKLJ for 2G or
GSM.

Coverage Plot And Best Server Plot
[119] In addition to the record of communication as tabulated
above, SP63 on the 16 June 2007 together with ASP Tonny
(SP75) and DSP Gan (SP76) had gone to several places to
determine the particular or the best serving station that captured
the test call he made based on the data in exh. P372B, ie, relating
to the handphone of 019-3636153 beginning from 19 October
2006 at 20:54:17 (p. 3 of 22 in P372B) till 19 October 2006 at
23:53:17 (p. 4 of 22 in P372B). For that purpose he used his
tools called “drive measurement tools” and he began his journey
from Bukit Aman to Bangsar and back to Bukit Aman before
proceeded to Kota Damansara via toll at Jalan Duta, then to
NKVE before exited toll Kota Damansara to Puncak Alam via
Sungai Buluh old road to the scene of this case before coming
back to Bukit Aman.
[120] According to SP63, upon completing all such ‘test-calls’ he
came up with a chart called “coverage prediction” of the base
station (exh. P374(1) - (17)) which shows the movement of the
first accused, the user of the said handphone 019-3636153
between 19 October 2006 at 20:54:17 till 23:53:17.
[121] These evidence of call logs and coverage plot were
vigorously challenged by the defence on the ground that they are
not authentic, being altered or tampered with, inaccurate and
unreliable.
[122] As for me, I must admit that these data and their
operation as explained by all those witnesses are highly technical.
Thus, in the absence of other rebuttal witness or witnesses, I am

accepting the evidence of SP61, SP62, SP63 and SP64 on the
face of it. All the four of them testified as to the creation,
production, arrangement and validation of those logs, the data of
which were retrieved from their data system.
Other Relevant Evidence
[123] The other relevant evidence adduced by the prosecution
are:

C

(1) the notes (exh. P21A) that were found by the deceased’s
cousin, Burmaa Oyunchimeg aka Amy (SP6) when she did the
packaging of the deceased’s bag before leaving Malaysia for
Hong Kong on 21 November 2006. SP6 confirmed the
handwriting in this notes to be of the decesed’s and the notes
read:

D

Dear all Malaysian government or police or embassy of
Mongolia, or newpapers.

E

F

G

... I came to Malaysia to see my boyfriend Mr. Razak
Abdullah Baginda. He married and live with his daughter
Rowena and wife and parents ...
I have been visiting his house and office, because I needed
to see him, yes I asked from him money, but I have
reason. I’m nice person, I can’t hurt someone, But
Mr Razak ... trying to scare me, trying to kill me. He send
his two Indian men to follow me, one of them Suraj
Kumar, he been coming to my hotel room every morning
around 5.00 a.m and knocking door, trying to scare me.
... They been following me for 4-5 days, even my hotel,
where I staying, workers know.
That time I really scared, I have some problem now time,
Mr. Razak Baginda promised to help me when I was
Mongolia, That’s why I came to see him and for help. ...

H

Yes, maybe I did mistake to bother him to blackmail him,
but if he didn’t promise to me I would never come from
far away to Malaysia. Only reason I’m here is I asking
help from Mr. Razak.

I

I got PI, private investigator, Mr. Hoh. But today he told
me, that Indians could kill and three put down from
window. And before I write letter I’ll suicide myself,
because I have no choice, he told that they have letter so
they kill me and says she suicide.

(2) the record of CCTV of the Hotel Malaya Kuala Lumpur
capturing the presence of the first accused and the second
accused at the said hotel on 18 October 2006 between
4.50pm to 5pm. Sup. Amidon bin Aman (SP58) identified the
image of a male shown in the still photo, ie, P340A to be the
first accused and P340 B and C as the second accused.
According to SP58, the still images as shown in P48E are also
the image of both the first and the second accused who were
seen at the 8th floor of the same hotel. Loo Mow Chan
(SP17) Operation Manager of the same hotel confirmed P48E
was captured by his CCTV camera placed at the 8th floor of
the hotel.
(3) the evidence of traces of blood stains on the slippers
(exh. P53C) that was found from inside the second accused’s
car, ie, Suzuki 4WD No. CAC 1883 (as shown in photos P25
[1-6]). The said slippers were recovered on 9 November 2006
by Sup. Soo Me Tong (SP42), Ketua Bahagian Kimia,
Makmal Forensik, PDRM Cheras. Upon analysis, the chemist
Mr Primulpathi (SP39) confirmed the said traces of blood
stains as one from the same maternal lineage of that of the
deceased.
(4) the evidence of the smart tag device slot (P150B) and T&G
card (P150C) that were also recovered from inside the second
accused’s car by the same SP42. According to Wan Abdullah
bin Wan Ali (SP34), the executive with Rangkaian Segar
Sdn Bhd that produced Kad Pintar, Touch n Go’, based on
the record called the “Card Ownership Detail Reports” for
T&G manufacturing no. 1831039713 (P115 & P119) belonged
to the RF 125591 Sirul Azhar Hj Umar. Further according to
SP34 based on the said P119/P115, the movement of the car

(5) the recovery of a spent cartridge (exh. P185B) from inside the
second accused’s car by the same SP42. The said spent
cartridge of 9 mm SME 06, was examined by Shaari bin Desa
(SP40), the chemist who upon doing the ballistic test
concluded that the said spent cartridge had been discharged
from the machine gun HK-MP55D (exh. P263A). The said
machine gun, according to WPC Fatimah bt Abd Wahab
(SP15), the constable in-charge of Amoury of the UTK Bukit
Aman, was issued to the second accused on 4 October 2006
and was returned only on 30 October 2006.
(6) that the traces of soil (exh. P184B) taken by the same SP42
from the mud flap and the rim of the second accused’s car
was upon comparison by the chemist with the samples of the
soil taken at the scene was negative.
(7) the evidence of Forensic Video Analysis photograph
(exh. P274A - L) adduced through Mohd Zobri Adil bin Talib
(SP49), Juruanalisa Digital Forensic Kana with Cyber Security
Malaysia (formerly known as NISER). He had analysed the
Hi Rev Storage media tape (exh. P122) which was taken from
the CCTV placed at the Plaza Tol Kota Damansara which he
received from ASP Tonny (SP75) on 11 June 2007. According
to SP49 based on the said Forensic Video Analysis
photograph, the car as appeared in P274(B), (E) and (I) was
the same as Suzuki CAC 1883 based on the consistency of
the unique similarities. He further said, the said car had passed
through the said Plaza Tol on 19 October 2006 at 7:14:40am,
8:48:55pm, 10:03:53pm and 11:55:36pm on the 19 October
2006;
(8) the recovery by SP23 of the notes (exh. P80A) from inside
the bag of the first accused kept inside his office. The writings
in the said notes had been confirmed by the Document
Examiner (SP30) to be consistent with the handwriting
specimens of the third accused (exh. P105 (A1-A5) and
(B1-B5)) save for one at the middle part. The said notes read:

The Sworn Affidavit Of The Third Accused (exh. P436)
[124] Towards the end of the trial, the prosecution decided to
tender the affidavit sworn by the third accused that had been filed
to court (Mahkamah 1) on 5 January 2007 for the purpose of his
application for bail in the Notis Usul No.: 45-120-2006. Through
the Timbalan Pendaftar, Wan Mohd Norisham bin Wan Yaakob
(SP81), the said affidavit was produced and marked as
exh. P436. With the concession of the learned DPP and the
learned counsel for the first accused, the averment at para. 34(b)
and 36 of this affidavit which said to be highly prejudicial to the
first accused was excluded.
[125] The relevant paragraphs that SP8 was asked to read are
paras. 17, 18 and 19 which clearly show a self admitted averment
of the third accused of his relationship with the deceased. They
are as follows:
17. Saya bermula kenal dengan Si Mati (“Hubungan tersebut”)
pada lebih kurang bulan November 2004. Saya telah
menamatkan Hubungan tersebut pada lebih kurang bulan

Hubungan tersebut.
19. Pada lebih kurang bulan April 2006 saya telah membuat
keputusan untuk tidak lagi tunduk kepada peras ugut Si Mati
(“Keputusan tersebut”). Saya membuat Keputusan tersebut
kerana saya tidak lagi khuatir sama ada Si Mati akan
mendedahkan (expose) Hubungan tersebut atau pun tidak.
Tambahan pula, saya juga tidak mahu terus membayar Si
Mati. Mulai dari masa itu, Si Mati telah mengganggu
(harass) saya melalui telefon dan surat. Selanjutnya, pada
lebih kurang bulan Ogos 2006, Si Mati telah mengugut
untuk datang ke Pejabat saya.

Rulings On the Specific Issue (at the end of the prosecution’s
case)
[126] Having heard the submissions from both the defence and
the prosecution, the following are my rulings on the specific issue
raised, which ruling had been reserved to be decided at this stage.

The Application To Impeach The Credibility Of SP7
(Rohaniza bt Roslan)
[127] It is my ruling while the explanation advanced by SP7 may
not be absolutely satisfactory but considering her evidence as a
whole, and the evidence of the rest of the prosecution’s
witnesses, I accept all her explanations as aforesaid. It is generally
perceived that a witness in giving a contradictory oral evidence
with one of his or her statement to police is labouring under
misapprehension that the said evidence would be favorable for or
prejudicial against the party he or she testifying for. In this case,
apart from SP7 saying that the first accused did not get into the
Vitara car and left Bukit Aman with the deceased yet she
remained consistent that the first accused called her after 11pm
on the same night and asked her to pick him up at either Rawang
or Jalan Duta Tol Plaza, which would mean that the first accused
was not at Bukit Aman during the relevant period. This part of
her evidence is corroborated by the record of the call logs and the
coverage prediction (exh. P374(1)-(17). To my mind, whether the
Tol Plaza is one of Rawang or Jalan Duta is immaterial. In the
premise, the credibility of SP7 is saved and restored.

The Application To Impeach The Credibility Of TWD3
(DSP Mohd, Yusri bin Hassan Basri)
[128] It is my ruling that while the said explanation of the TWD3
may not be absolutely satisfactory but his credibility considering
the evidence of the other prosecution’s witnesses and that the
said police statement was recorded about ten months after the
event, is to that extent, restored and saved. To my mind all his
answer of “tidak pasti” (not sure) in both his statement and oral
evidence in court may mean either way.
The Application For The Court To Exercise Discretion To
Exclude The Informations Of s. 27 Against The First
Accused
[129] Having considered all the issues raised by the first accused,
I have no reasons to doubt the credibility and reliability of
Ch. Insp. Koh Fei Cheow’s evidence that the first accused who
is also a Police Inspector and the Investigation Officer himself did
in fact supply the information as aforesaid and that Ch. Insp.
Koh Fei Cheow had no prior knowledge of the particular place of
the scene. I therefore find it difficult to exercise my discretion to
exclude them.
The Application For The Court To Exercise Discretion To
Exclude The Informations Of s. 27 Against The Second
Accused
[130] Having considered all the issues raised for the second
accused, I find that the second accused has succeeded in
showing the shoddy and slip shod manner in the investigation of
some officers and the inconsistencies in the evidence of the
prosecution’s witnesses. To my mind, while inconsistencies in the
testimony of the witnesses is expected, the fact remains that the
said “barang-barang kemas” were discovered in consequence to
the said informations supplied by him. I therefore likewise refuse
to exercise my discretion to exclude them.

The Sworn Affidavit Of The Third Accused (exh. P436)
[131] The prosecution had contended that the tendering of the
said affidavit amounts to no acceptance on their part of the truth
of what is stated therein, reliance being placed on the ruling by
Federal Court in Balachandran v. PP [2005] 1 CLJ 85, which held:

I



[2012] 1 CLJ

PP v. Azilah Hadri & Ors

407

A

It is settled law that an exculpatory statement cannot from the basis of
an order in favour of an accused person at the close of the case for the
prosecution as the accused, not having given evidence at that stage,
cannot rely on the statement without it having been tested by
cross examination.

B

adopting the approach in the Singapore’s case of Chan Kin Choi
v. PP [1991] 1 LNS 80, which ruled that:

C

... It was not the law in Singapore that the exculpatory
statements in a confession used by the prosecution as part of
its evidence were admissible as evidence of the truth of the
contents thereof.

and also Lim Yow Choon v. PP [1971] 1 LNS 65 where the
Federal Court answered:
D

E

F

G

H

I

In our judgment, in reference to the cautioned statement ... we
are of the view that notwithstanding that the cautioned statement
was part of the evidence for the prosecution, and that there are
facts in the cautioned statement which appear to contradict other
parts of the evidence led by the prosecution, it was still open to
the trial court as a judge of facts to assess the evidence and in
so doing accept part of it and reject the rest. It would not
necessarily follow as a matter of law, that in the circumstances of
the case, the trial court should acquit the appellant at the close of
the case for the prosecution by reason of such contradictory
evidence in the case for the prosecution.

[132] The learned counsel for the third accused person submitted
that such ruling is only applicable to the extent that it is not
sufficient by itself to discharge the onus lying on the accused to
rebut the statutory presumptions under s. 37(d) and s. 37(da)
Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 as was so ruled by the Supreme
Court in PP v. Adetunji Adeleye Sule [1993] 3 CLJ 113 and PP v.
Lin Lian Chen [1992] 4 CLJ 2086; [1992] 1 CLJ (Rep) 285 and
the said cases apply a fortiori to the present affidavit which is now
forming part of the case for the prosecution.
[133] It is clear to me, that all the judicial pronouncement by the
Supreme Court and Federal Court as aforesaid are those
pertaining to a cautioned statement and a confession, ie, a
cautioned statements in the cases of Lim Yow Choon, Balachandran,
Adetunji Adeleye Sule, Lim Lian Chen (supra) and a confession in the
case of Chan Kin Choy (supra). Whereas this affidavit (exh. P436)
in the present case is one that was sworn before the
Commissioner for Oath Mr Wong Ah Ying who is one of the



408

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

witnesses made available by the prosecution to the defence. Thus,
unlike the cautioned statement and confession, this affidavit is not
part and parcel of the investigation process. The sworn statement
is instead governed by the Oaths and Affirmations Act 1949.
Section 13 of this Act provides:

A

B

Every person giving evidence on any subject before any Court or
person authorized by the Act to administer oaths and affirmation
shall be bound to state the truth on such subject.

[134] Since this affidavit is now forming part of the case for the
prosecution, it is my view therefore, that its entire contents
including the exculpatory part must be given the due weight as it
is given to the rest of the evidence for the prosecution. Therefore,
the question of deferring or suspending the consideration of its
weight to a later stage of the proceeding merely for the purpose
of getting him to repeat them does not arise.

C

D

Prima Facie
[135] Having considered the evidence adduced by the
prosecution in its totality, I am satisfied and it is therefore my
findings that:

E

(1) the fragment of bones collected at the scene were one of the
Altantuya Shaariibuu’s, the deceased;
(2) the cause of death of the deceased was probable blast related
injuries and the probable time of death was between 10pm on
19 October 2006 till 1am on 20 October 2006;
(3) all the reference of “perempuan Cina” by Lans Corp. Rohaniza
(SP7) is actually Altantuya, the deceased;

F

G

(4) all the reference of “Vitara” by SP7 is actually “Suzuki 4WD”,
that is the second accused’s car bearing the registration
number of CAC 1883;
(5) all the reference of “a man in green cap”, is actually the
second accused; and
(6) I accept the evidence of Sup. Amidon (SP58) that the image
of male shown in the still photo of P340A to be the first
accused and of P340B & C to be the second accused.

[136] I agree with the submission of the learned DPP that the
traces of blood stain found the slippers from inside the second
accused’s car could not possibly be planted there for it’s recovery
was on the 9 November 2006 whereas the remains of the
deceased was found on the 6 November 2006 without any traces
of fresh or dried blood and that the blood specimen of the
deceased’s father, Shaariibuu Setev (SP2) was taken only on the
10 November 2006. With respect, I also see the logic in the
learned DPP’s remark that the police could have easily put the soil
taken from the scene on the said Suzuki CAC 1883 had they
really wanted to frame the second accused.
[137] The way the deceased came about her death is very tragic
indeed. There can be no doubt that whoever perpetrated this
despicable and unthinkable act of blasting on the deceased must
have intended to completely vanish the related evidence into the
thin air. Whatever his motive was, it is a matter of law that the
“motive” although relevant has never been the essential to
constitute murder. The question for which I am to determine at
this stage is who could have possibly connected with the death
of the deceased.
[138] I begin by asking, what was both the first and second
accused doing at Hotel Malaya on the 18 October 2006? All the
more to be at the 8th floor, the same floor where the deceased’s
room was located. Further, what was the first accused’s
instruction to the second accused when he shifted the deceased
from his car into the second accused’s car before the second
accused left Bukit Aman?. Then, why did he the next day turned
to be unusually quiet and yet told Rohaniza (SP7) that Altantuya
had suddenly disappeared. I may endlessly ask why and why.
[139] All the question as aforesaid, to my mind taken together
with the said respective evidence of s. 27 against the first accused
which led to the discovery of the scene and the remains of the
deceased and of the second accused which led to the discovery
of jewelleries of the deceased, and the evidence of the call logs,
card ownership detail report, forensic video analysis photographs,
the coverage and best server plot, along with the evidence of
spent cartridge and traces of blood stain found from inside the
second accused’s car, have the cumulative effect of tending to
connect both the first and second accused to the charge against
them.

(“Rumah Saya”) di mana saya tinggal bersama-sama
dengan keluarga saya;
(b) saya juga meminta bantuan DSP Musa untuk
membolehkan pihak polis menghantar kereta polis untuk
meronda sekitar Rumah Saya; dan
(c) memperkenalkan seorang pegawai polis yang bertugas
di IPD Brickfields (Rumah Saya terletak dalam
bidangkuasa daerah polis tersebut) untuk membantu
mengenai gangguan oleh Si mati.
Para 27 DSP Musa memberitahu saya bahawa beliau akan
membantu dengan memperkenalkan terkemudiannya seorang
pegawai polis untuk membantu saya.
Para 28 Pada 16 Oktober 2006 dalam suatu perjumpaan antara
saya dengan PB dan DN (Dhiren Norendra)
(“Perjumpaan dengan PB dan DN”), PB telah
menyarankan aduan dibuat untuk megusir (deport) Si
Mati dari Malaysia. Saya dan DN menolak cadangan ini
dengan tegas.
Para 29 Pada sebelah pagi 17 Oktober 2006, Si Mati telah
datang ke Rumah saya untuk cuba berjumpa dengan
saya, dan “lawatan” ini (“Lawatan Rumah”) diketahui
oleh MM (Mazlinda bt Makhzan). Saya tidak berada di
Rumah saya pada masa itu.

Para 30 Pada sebelah malam 17 Oktober 2006, saya berada di
Rumah saya bersama-sama dengan Keluarga saya apabila
terdapat kekecohan di Luar Rumah saya (“Kekecohan
Pertama”).
Para 31 Saya terus memanggil telefon bimbit DSP Musa
(019-2692011)
tetapi
malangnya
saya
gagal
menghubunginya. Selepas itu, saya memanggil PB dan
DN untuk membantu. Akibatnya, sebuah kereta polis
tiba di Rumah saya dan menyelesaikan Kekecohan
Pertama. Saya tidak membuat laporan polis mengenai
Kekecohan Pertama kerana DN tidak menasihati saya
untuk membuat demikian.
Para 32 DSP Musa kemudiannya menelefon saya dan
memberitahu bahawa seorang pegawai polis akan
menelefon saya untuk menghulurkan bantuan mengenai
gangguan oleh Si Mati. Menurut DSP Musa, pegawai
polis yang akan memanggil saya kenal Ketua Bahagian
Siasatan Jenayah Daerah Brickfields (“KBSJD”).
Para 33 Saya kemudiannya berjumpa dengan AH (“Perjumpaan
dengan AH”) di pejabat saya di mana:

(a) saya telah memberitahu AH tentang Kekecohan Pertama;
(b) ...

(c) Selepas teguran Pertama saya, AH menanya bagaimana
AH boleh membantu mengenai gangguan oleh Si Mati.
Saya meminta bantuan AH agar:
(i) Pihak polis boleh meronda sekitar Rumah Saya. Untuk
tujuan ini, saya memberi maklumat mengenai alamat
Rumah saya. nama bapa saya, nama Si Mati, “Hotel
Malaya” di mana Si Mati tinggal (mengikut maklumat
yang diberi oleh PB kepada saya); dan
(ii) Memperkenalkan seorang polis di daerah Brickfields
kepada saya;

meminta saya memaklumkan jika Si Mati mengganggu
saya atau Keluarga Saya terkemudiannya (“Permintaan

itu saya berada di luar Rumah saya bersama-sama

Para 38 Pada 20 Oktober 2006, saya telah pergi ke pejabat TPM
atas urusan rasmi dan telah bertembung dengan DSP
Musa (“Perjumpaan dengan DSP Musa”). Dalam
perjumpaan dengan DSP Musa, saya menanya DSP
Musa apa yang berlaku selepas Kekecohan Kedua dan
DSP Musa memberitahu saya bahawa AH tidak
mengatakan apa-apa. Untuk beberapa hari selepas itu,
saya terus menanya DSP Musa mengenai Si Mati, sama
ada melalui telefon ataupun apabila saya bertembung
dengan DSP Musa semasa kerja saya dengan MSRC,
dan jawapan DSP Musa adalah sentiasa sama.

[141] Now, can these parts of the said affidavit be ignored or
rejected? It is my finding that in the absence of any rebuttal
evidence against them coupled with the fact that there is no legal
onus that lies upon the third accused to rebut any statutory
presumptions (such as in s. 37(d) and 37(da) DDA in the drugs
cases), there is clearly to my mind, no reason for them to be
ignored and rejected.
[142] I have perused through the whole contents of the said
affidavit. The learned counsel for the third accused submitted that
the all the exculpatory parts were corroborated in material
particulars by P Balasubramaniam (SP1), Burmaa Oyuchimeg
(SPG) Lans Corp. Rohaniza (SP7) and Siti Aishah bt Mohd Azlan
(SP9), and the other surrounding circumstances have clearly
negated and nullified the act of abetment as alleged against the

third accused. I have no reason to disagree with him. The
averment about threat and blackmailing for example, is
corroborated by the threatening letters sent by the deceased to
the third accused, ie, P22A, P22C and P24. In P22A the
deceased wrote as follows:

B

C

if you prefer money
Than life, it’s ok
hope you’ll prefer
more than money
your Rowena life
Better hurry
Razak;

and the deceased’s message in P23A reads:
D

E

Razak
Don’t play ok
I saw today morning
And yesterday too
I will stay at your
Office outside
Or you call me now
Or [illegible]
Or ill come to your home today
- “Amina”

H

[143] The learned counsel for the third accused again submitted
that the notes (exh. P80A) written by the third accused that was
found from the first accused’s bag with the full address of his
house in the name of his father Dato’ Abdullah Malim Baginda, is
wholly consistent with that of an innocent man asking the first
accused in a bona fide manner for assistance, ie, for the police to
patrol the vicinity of the third accused’s house against the
deceased’s harassment and threats. ASP Zulkarnain (SP23), had
admitted that the name of Dato’ Abdullah Malim Baginda is the
name of third accused’s father whom he had met at the same
address as written on the same notes. I cannot agree more with
the learned counsel.

I

[144] The learned counsel also submitted the contents of the
notes (exh. P21A) written by the deceased had only undermined
the deceased’s credibility herself as her claim that her Private
Investigator (PI), one Mr Hoh had informed her that ... “Indians

F

G

could kill and put down from window” was not confirmed by
Ang Chong Beng (SP5), her own PI. The learned counsel further
submitted that the averment about blackmailing in the said affidavit
was also confirmed by the admission of the deceased herself when
she said in her notes, ... “Yes, maybe I did mistake to bother him
to blackmail him”.
[145] Having considered the evidence led by the prosecution in
its totality to a maximum evaluation and guided by the advice set
down by the Federal Court in the case PP v. Mohd Radzi
Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ 457 and Balachandran v. PP [2005]
1 CLJ 85, I have asked myself, am I prepared to send all the
three accused persons to the gallows, if they elect to remain silent,
when I now call upon them to make their defence on the
evidence before me? In the case of both the first and second
accused, I am satisfied that the answer is a resounding ‘Yes’. In
the case of the third accused, there is only one answer starring at
me, that is ‘negative’. I am not prepared. In my view, once the
essential elements of abetment, ie, by instigation, by conspiracy
and by aiding, and in the context of this case, the death of
Altantuya is not proven on the basis of a “prima facie” evidence
any other inferences and doubts that may have arisen must be
resolved, as is trite, in favour of the accused person. It is not for
the court to call for the defence merely to clear or clarify such
doubts. Even if the third accused can be inferred as having had
any “motive” in the light of all the blackmailing letters of the
deceased it cannot be made a basis for conviction of him without
any direct or circumstantial evidence of his participation in any
manner in the commission of offence (see Yogi Choudhary v. State
of Bihar [2005] Cri LJ 2285; and Varatharajalu v. PP [1960] 1
LNS 159).
[146] Consequently, I am satisfied that there is prima facie case
for the first and second accused to answer as charged. I therefore
call upon each of them to make their defence. In the case of the
third accused, I am satisfied that there is no prima facie for him
to answer his charge. I accordingly find the third accused not
guilty and order him to be acquitted and discharged.

The Defence Case
[147] The defence of the first accused by way of his sole
evidence on oath has essentially been as follows – that he did not
utter those statements relating to the scene which were admitted
by this court as evidence of information leading to discovery of
facts under s. 27 of Evidence Act – that he was not at the scene
of crime at the relevant date and time and instead claimed that
he was somewhere in Wangsa Maju as per his notice of alibi
(exh. D430). The first accused further claimed that he was not
the last person to be with the deceased for he had handed over
the deceased on the night question to the second accused for the
second accused to send the deceased back to Hotel Malaya.
[148] The defence of the second accused by way of his unsworn
written statement (exh. D441) are as follows:
Pada 18.10.2006 saya bertugas di pejabat Unit Tindakan Khas
(UTK, Bukit Aman, Kuala Lumpur. Saya telah menghadiri
taklimat penugasan pada pagi tersebut dan telah diberi tugasan
sebagai pemandu “standby” pada waktu pejabat. Sekiranya ada
pegawai atau anggota yang ingin ke mana atas urusan tugas, saya
ditugaskan untuk memandu mereka. Pada sebelah pagi 18.10.2006,
Azilah Hadri (OKT 1) ada menghubungi saya melalui telefon
bimbit dan meminta saya berjumpa dengannya. Azilah ada
bertanya dengan saya tentang penugasan saya pada hari tersebut
dan saya memaklumkan beliau mengenai penugasan waktu pejabat
saya sebagai pemandu waktu “standby”. Dalam perbualan telefon
tersebut, saya bertanyakan Azilah lokasi beliau berada dan Azilah
telah memberitahu saya bahawa beliau berada di Jalan Ampang,
berhampiran Ampang Point menuju ke Central Market. Azilah
mahu berjumpa dengan saya di Central Market. Di samping itu,
Azilah juga bertanyakan saya samada saya tahu lokasi Hotel
Malaya. Saya memberitahu Azilah saya tidak tahu lokasi Hotel
Malaya, malah saya tidak pernah mendengar nama Hotel tersebut
walaupun saya telah tinggal di Kuala Lumpur hampir 10 tahun.
Saya turut memberitahu Azilah bahawa saya sibuk pada ketika itu
dan tidak dapat bertemu dengannya. Walau bagaimanapun, saya
menyatakan kesediaan saya untuk bertemu beliau setelah saya
selesai bertugas. Pada masa tersebut, saya sedang memandu
DSP Khairi ke kawasan Gombak atas urusan pembelian barangbarang pejabat UTK. Tidak lama selepas itu Azilah menelefon
saya semula dan meminta saya bertemu dengannya juga setelah
selesai urusan pembelian barangan UTK.

[2012] 1 CLJ

Sekembali ke pejabat, setelah selesai memandu DSP Khairi, saya
telah menelefon Azilah dan bertanyakan lokasi tepat bagi
pertemuan kami. Azilah menetapkan tempat pertemuan kami di
hentian bas/teksi bersebelahan Central Market. Setiba saya di
hentian bas/teksi tersebut pada jam 2.00 petang 18/10/2006, Azilah
memang sedia menunggu. Saya memperlahankan kenderaan di
pinggir jalan raya bersebelahan hentian itu dan Azilah terus naik
kereta saya. Pada masa tersebut saya memandu kereta model
Proton Satria. Kemudian Azilah mengarahkan saya memandu di
sekeliling Kuala Lumpur untuk mencari lokasi Hotel Malaya tetapi
setelah lama berlegar-legar kami gagal menjumpai hotel tersebut.
Azilah kemudian mengarahkan saya untuk memandu keluar dari
kawasan Kuala Lumpur menuju ke Damansara. Saya bertanya
kepada Azilah apakah tujuan mencari Hotel Malaya dan apakah
tujuan untuk ke Damansara? Azilah memberitahu saya beliau ada
kerja yang hendak dilaksanakan dan meminta saya mengikutinya
sahaja. Dalam perjalanan ke Damansara, Azilah ada menceritakan
kepada saya bahawa DSP Musa Bin Safri telah memberitahu
beliau hal seorang kawan DSP Musa yang sedang menghadapi
“masalah perempuan”. Azilah mengarahkan saya untuk memandu
ke rumah kawan DSP Musa yang dimaksudkan di Bukit
Damansara. Menurut Azilah kawan DSP Musa adalah seorang
yang berjawatan tinggi, seorang ahli perniagaan dan seorang yang
berada. Walau bagaimanapun, Azilah tidak mendedahkan kepada
saya identiti kawan DSP Musa itu. Sepanjang perjalanan tersebut
Azilah juga menceritakan kepada saya bahawa seorang perempuan
dan seorang lelaki yang dipercayai abang kepada perempuan
tersebut, kedua-duanya berbangsa Cina telah mengganggu dan
membuat kecoh di hadapan rumah kawan DSP Musa. Menurut
Azilah lagi, perempuan itu adalah kekasih lama kawan DSP Musa
tersebut. Setiba di Bukit Damansara, Azilah telah mengarahkan
saya untuk memasuki satu kawasan taman perumahan dan kami
tiba di sebuah rumah banglo. Azilah meminta saya
memperlahankan kenderaan dan sewaktu melalui di hadapan rumah
banglo tersebut, Azilah memberitahu saya bahawa itulah rumah
kawan DSP Musa yang dimaksudkan. Setelah meninggalkan
kawasan tersebut, Azilah meminta saya mengingati jalan ke banglo
tersebut. Menurut Azilah, beliau telah berjanji kepada DSP Musa
untuk membantu kawan DSP Musa untuk membuat rondaan di
sekitar kawasan banglo tersebut dari masa ke semasa di luar
waktu bertugas untuk mengelakkan perempuan dan lelaki Cina
tersebut membuat kecoh di hadapan rumah kawannya. Pada tahap
ini, Azilah telah memohon bantuan saya dan bertanya sekiranya
beliau mempunyai tugasan rasmi di luar Kuala Lumpur adakah
saya sanggup menolong beliau membuat rondaan di sekitar
kawasan berkenaan dari masa ke semasa sekiranya saya tidak

mempunyai sebarang tugas rasmi. Saya bersetuju berbuat
demikian kerana saya mengenali DSP Musa dan saya melihat
tugasan ini sebagai bantuan yang dipinta oleh DSP Musa, seorang
pegawai atasan saya. Saya beranggapan bahawa persetujuan saya
untuk membantu Azilah adalah sebenarnya persetujuan saya untuk
berkhidmat kepada pegawai atasan saya.
Daripada Bukit Damansara Azilah mengarahkan saya untuk
memandu semula ke Central Market kerana kereta beliau masih
berada di tempat letak kereta di Central Market. Ketika dalam
perjalanan, Azilah memberitahu saya bahawa perempuan dan lelaki
Cina tersebut tinggal di Hotel Malaya. Pada ketika itu, barulah
saya menyedari bahawa tujuan Azilah mencari lokasi Hotel Malaya
adalah untuk mengenal pasti tempat tinggal perempuan dan lelaki
Cina itu. Sepanjang saya bersama Azilah dalam perjalanan tersebut,
beliau tidak pernah menunjukkan apa-apa dokumen, kertas ataupun
nota yang mengandungi sebarang maklumat tentang identiti kawan
DSP Musa, alamat tempat tinggal, alamat hotel, nombor telefon,
mahupun identiti perempuan serta lelaki Cina tersebut. Sewaktu
kami hampir tiba di Central Market, Azilah mengarahkan saya
untuk memberhentikan kenderaan saya di luar Central Market
kerana beliau ingin berjumpa rakannya, yang merupakan seorang
pelukis di central market untuk bertanyakan lokasi Hotel Malaya.
Saya memasuki kawasan letak kereta Central Market dan
menunggu di dalam kereta selama sepuluh minit sementara Azilah
masuk ke dalam Central Market. Tidak lama kemudian, Azilah
mengetuk cermin kereta saya dan memberitahu saya bahawa Hotel
Malaya hanya terletak di kawasan sekitar Petaling Street, tidak
jauh daripada Central Market. Azilah menyuruh saya mematikan
enjin kereta dan mengikutinya ke Hotel Malaya secara berjalan
kaki.
Setibanya di Hotel Malaya, kami masuk ke ruang lobi. Azilah
menyuruh saya mengambil risalah, katalog dan sebaran yang
terdapat di sudut maklumat di lobi Hotel tersebut. Kemudian
Azilah berjalan ke ruang lif dan mengajak saya memasuki lif untuk
ke tingkat atas. Azilah menekan butang di dalam lif tersebut tetapi
saya tidak tahu ke tingkat berapa. Apabila lif berhenti dan pintunya
terbuka, Azilah mengajak saya keluar dari lif tersebut. Saya tidak
tahu di tingkat berapa saya berada pada masa tersebut tetapi jika
tidak silap saya, lif tersebut berhenti di tingkat tujuh. Saya
mengikut Azilah dari belakang dan tiba-tiba Azilah berhenti di
hadapan sebuah bilik yang pintunya tertutup. Saya tidak mengingati
berapakah nombor bilik tersebut. Pada masa itu, Azilah tidak
berkata apa-apa kepada saya. Saya bertanya Azilah apa yang ingin
beliau lakukan? Azilah berkata beliau berhasrat untuk berjumpa

417



418

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

perempuan dan lelaki Cina itu untuk menasihati mereka agar tidak
menganggu atau membuat kecoh di hadapan rumah kawan DSP
Musa lagi. Kemudian Azilah memberitahu saya bahawa beliau tidak
begitu pasti samada bilik berkenaan adalah bilik yang sebenarnya
dihuni oleh perempuan dan lelaki Cina itu. Selepas itu Azilah
mengajak saya beredar dari situ. Kami menaiki lif dan turun
semula ke lobi Hotel Malaya. Kami kemudiannya keluar dari pintu
utama meninggalkan Hotel Malaya dan berjalan kaki semula ke
tempat letak kereta Central Market. Di tempat letak kereta
berkenaan, Azilah menyuruh saya pulang ke pejabat sahaja dan
sekiranya bantuan saya diperlukan beliau akan menelefon saya.
Saya memandu pulang ke pejabat UTK.
Pada 19.10.2006, lebih kurang jam 8.45 malam, saya berada di
rumah saya di Kota Damansara dan sedang menonton televisyen.
Tiba-tiba saya menerima satu panggilan telefon daripada Azilah
yang meminta saya datang ke rumah kawan DSP Musa yang
kami kunjungi siang tadi di Bukit Damansara. Menurut Azilah
beliau menerima maklumat bahawa perempuan dan lelaki Cina
tersebut berada di hadapan rumah kawan DSP Musa dan Azilah
memerlukan bantuan sokongan daripada saya jika sekiranya lelaki
Cina tersebut bertindak ganas. Saya memberitahu Azilah saya akan
segera siap dan pergi ke sana. Lebih kurang lima minit kemudian,
saya keluar meninggalkan rumah saya dengan menaiki kenderaan
jeep saya dan memasuki tol Kota Damansara di lebuh raya NKVE
untuk ke bukit Damansara. Dalam perjalanan ke rumah kawan
DSP Musa di sekitar kawasan Bukit Damansara, saya terlupa
lokasi tepat rumah tersebut dan terpaksa menelefon Azilah untuk
mendapatkan panduan arah. Tidak lama selepas itu, Azilah
menghubungi saya semula untuk bertanyakan samada panduan
arah yang beliau berikan telah membolehkan saya menemui lokasi
rumah tersebut. Saya memberitahu Azilah saya sudah hampir tiba.
Setiba di kawasan berhampiran rumah kawan DSP Musa, saya
telah memberhentikan kenderaan di tepi sebuah simpang tiga dan
berjalan kaki menuju ke rumah tersebut. Semasa menghampiri
rumah tersebut, saya nampak Azilah sedang bercakap-cakap
dengan seorang perempuan Cina dan seorang lelaki India bertubuh
gempal. Apabila Azilah nampak saya menghampiri rumah tersebut
beliau telah membuat isyarat tangan kepada saya yang kelihatan
seolah-olah menyuruh saya masuk ke dalam kereta Wira Aeroback
berwarna merah yang ada berhampiran rumah banglo itu, Saya
menurut arahan Azilah dan memasuki kereta tersebut. Saya duduk
di kerusi sebelah pemandu dan saya dapati ada seorang perempuan
Melayu sedang duduk di kerusi pemandu. Tidak lama selepas itu,
saya nampak perempuan Cina tersebut berjalan menuju ke kereta
Wira Aeroback merah berkenaan sambil diikuti oleh Azilah,

meninggalkan lelaki India bertubuh gempal tersebut. Perempuan
Cina tersebut terus membuka pintu penumpang belakang kereta
tersebut dan memasukinya. Perempuan Melayu yang pada mulanya
duduk di tempat pemandu itu membuka pintu kenderaan dan
keluar daripadanya dan kemudian memasuki semula ke tempat
duduk belakang. Azilah memasuki kenderaan dan duduk di tempat
pemandu. Sewaktu Azilah hendak memulakan pemanduan, seorang
lelaki Cina datang menjenguk tingkapnya. Lelaki Cina itu
menuntut tambang teksi yang belum dijelaskan oleh perempuan
Cina tersebut. Azilah telah menghulurkan sekeping wang RM50.00
tetapi pemandu teksi itu berkata tidak cukup kerana tambang yang
sepatut diterimanya adalah RM150.00. Azilah menghulurkan dua
keping lagi wang RM50.00 kepada pemandu teksi itu. Kemudian
kami beredar meninggalkan kawasan rumah banglo tersebut. Setiba
di simpang tiga tidak jauh dari situ, saya meminta Azilah
menurunkan saya di situ untuk saya kembali ke kenderaan saya.
Kemudian saya memandu kenderaan saya untuk keluar dari
kawasan tersebut. Saya dapat melihat bahawa kereta Azilah
mengekori saya dari belakang. Apabila kami keluar semula ke jalan
utama iaitu Jalan Damansara menuju ke Jalan Duta, Azilah telah
menghubungi saya melalui telefon dan meminta saya
memberhentikan kenderaan di tepi jalan raya. Sewaktu itu, saya
sedang memandu di sekitar kawasan di mana terletaknya
Bangunan Amanah Raya yang lama. Saya memberhentikan
kenderaan di tepi sebuah perhentian bas dan saya lihat Azilah turut
memberhentikan kenderaan di tepi sebuah perhentian bas dan saya
lihat Azilah turut memberhentikan kenderaan di belakang saya.
Kemudian Azilah turun dari keretanya dan menghampiri kenderaan
saya. Saya menurunkan cermin dan Azilah berkata beliau sedang
menasihati perempuan Cina tersebut dan berdasarkan perilaku dan
respon perempuan Cina tersebut, Azilah mengatakan beliau
mempercayai perempuan Cina itu kelihatan seolah-olah menerima
nasihat yang telah beliau berikan. Kemudian Azilah bertanya pada
saya ke mana saya ingin pergi. Saya memberitahu Azilah bahawa
memandangkan keadaan adalah terkawal dan saya tidak
mempunyai apa-apa peranan lagi saya ingin pulang ke rumah.
Azilah kata “Ok”. Selepas itu, saya meneruskan pemanduan dari
Jalan Damansara membelok sebelah kiri ke Jalan Duta yang
menghala ke arah lebuhraya NKVE dan Kompleks Kerajaan Jalan
Duta. Sebelum membuat belokan yang menghala ke NKVE, saya
telah menghubungi Azilah melalui telefon untuk bertanyakan
samada saya perlu membuat rondaan di kawasan rumah kawan
DSP Musa pada hari keesokannya memandangkan Azilah akan
bertugas di Putrajaya. Azilah memberitahu saya beliau sedang
bercakap dengan perempuan Cina tersebut dan meminta saya

419



420

Current Law Journal

[2012] 1 CLJ

menghubungi beliau semula dalam tempoh 5 minit. Setelah
membuat belokan ke arah NKVE, dan membuat belokan kiri sekali
lagi menghala ke Penchala Link, dan sewaktu saya berada di
kawasan komersial Sri Hartamas, saya telah menghubungi semula
Azilah untuk bertanyakan soalan yang sama. Menurut Azilah,
beliau telahpun menasihati perempuan Cina tersebut dan
perempuan itu bersetuju untuk tidak mengganggu atau membuat
kecoh di hadapan rumah kawan DSP Musa lagi, Azilah
memberitahu saya bahawa saya tidak perlu membuat rondaan pada
keesokan hari, sebaliknya, sekiranya dapat laporan gangguan atau
kekecohan daripada kawan DSP Musa, barulah Azilah akan
menghubungi saya. Selepas perbualan tersebut, saya telah
memberhentikan kenderaan di tempat letak kereta di kawasan
komersial Sri Hartamas dan pergi ke Restoran Devi’s Corner
untuk minum teh, makan tosai sambil mengimbas majalah “Motor
Trader”. Lebih kurang 20 minit kemudian, saya memandu semula
kenderaan keluar dari kawasan komersial Sri Hartamas menuju ke
lebuhraya NKVE. Saya telah memasuki plaza tol Jalan Duta dan
keluar di plaza tol Kota Damansara. Daripada plaza tol Kota
Damansara, saya memandu selama lebih kurang 5 minit untuk
kembali ke rumah saya. Saya tiba di rumah saya lebih kurang jam
10.00 malam. Kemudian pada sekitar jam 12.00 tengah malam,
saya sekali lagi memandu kenderaan saya keluar daripada rumah
menghala ke plaza tol Kota Damansara menuju ke plaza tol Jalan
Duta dan seterusnya ke Kampung Baru Kuala Lumpur untuk
bersahur.
Sebelum 31.10.2006, saya telah menerima arahan daripada ACP
Mastor untuk menjalankan tugas litupan keselamatan ke atas
YAB Perdana Menteri di Islamabad, Pakistan selama 10 hari
bermula daripada 31.10.2006 sehingga 9.11.2006. Sebelum
berlepas ke Paskitan, saya telah meninggalkan kenderaan jeep saya
di tempat letak kereta di perkarangan Bukit Aman dan
meninggalkan kunci kepada kenderaan tersebut dalam tray kunci
di Pejabat saya. Saya telah berpesan kepada Sarjan Rosli untuk
mengambil kunci daripada tray sekali-sekala dan menghidupkan
enjin kenderaan saya. Sebelum berlepas ke Pakistan, saya telah
mengemas kenderaan saya dan menyusun rapi barangan-barangan
dalamnya. Di antara barangan di dalam kenderaan saya pada masa
tersebut adalah sepasang selipar berwarna merah yang saya
sisipkan dengan rapi di tepi kotak plastik yang besar di bahagian
belakang (“boot”) kenderaan saya. Semasa perbicaraan ini, saya
telah berkesempatan melihat gambar bernombor 12 di dalam P25
di mana selipar berwarna merah ini boleh kelihatan tersisip rapi di
bahagian paling kanan. Selipar ini bersaiz 8, menurut saiz kaki
saya. Semasa perbicaraan saya juga berkesempatan melihat

gambar-gambar bernombor 35 sehingga 41 dalam P25 yang
menunjukkan sepasang selipar berwarna putih bertulis “BNA” di
atas pelapiknya dan bertulis “HEAT ADSAWD” di atas
galangnya. Saya tidak pernah melihat ataupun memiliki mahupun
memakai selipar ini. Bahkan semasa saya meninggalkan kenderaan
saya di tempat letak kereta Bukit Aman pada 31.10.2006, selipar
ini tidak berada di dalam kenderaan saya. Selipar ini juga tidak
sesuai dengan saiz saya.
Pada waktu pagi 5.11.2006, saya bertugas sebagai pengawal
peribadi kepada Perdana Menteri di mana ketika itu Perdana
Menteri berada di dalam bilik persidangan sebuah hotel di
Islamabad. Tiba-tiba, datang DSP Fisal meminta saya naik ke atas
untuk menyediakan makanan kepada seorang bergelar Dato’.
DSP Fisal mengarahkan saya untuk menyerahkan tugas. Saya
telah naik ke bilik dan mendapati rakan sekerja saya telah bersedia
untuk membuat pertukaran tugas. Saya telah serahkan pistol
kepada rakan saya dan saya berehat di dalam bilik beliau
sementara menantikan arahan selanjutnya untuk penyediaan
makanan. Tidak lama selepas itu, pintu bilik diketuk dan saya
membukanya, dan mendapati ACP Mastor terpacul di muka pintu
semasa Sarjan Jelima serta Korporal Zamri dari UTK.
ACP Mastor mnegarahkan saya untuk pulang ke Malaysia di atas
alasan bahawa bekas isteri saya telah membuat laporan polis
terhadap saya dan saya perlu pulang untuk menyelesaikan masalah
berkenaan. Saya, ACP Mastor, Sarjan Jelima dan Korporal Zamri
berlepas dari Islamabad ke Malaysia menaiki kapal terbang. Setiba
di KLIA pada 6.11.2006, terdapat pegawai dan anggota UTK telah
bersedia menanti kami di aero bridge. Saya dibawa ke dalam
kenderaan pasukan dan dipandu ke IPK Kuala Lumpur (“IPK
KL”). Tiba di IPK KL, saya diserahkan oleh ACP Mastor kepada
DSP Gan di pejabat D9 IPK KL. Di Pejabat D9, saya telah
disoalsiasat selama lebih kurang setengah jam. Tidak lama selepas
itu, datang seorang anggota yang saya kenali sebagai Sarjan Amran
yang telah mengenakan sebelah gari ke tangan saya dan sebelah
lagi gari ke tangannya. Kemudian muncul ASP Tony yang
mengarahkan saya dibawa ke Pajero Pasukan. Saya dibawa turun
melalui lif bersama ASP Tony, Janagaren, ASP Zulkarnain dan
beberapa anggota D9 yang lain termasuk seorang jurugambar yang
menggalas kamera video yang besar di bahunya. Tiba di bawah
saya diarahkan menaiki sebuah Pajero. Kedudukan saya dalam
Pajero adalah di bahagian tengah tempat duduk belakang, di kanan
saya Sarjan Amran dan di sebelah kiri saya ASP Zulkarnain.
Pemandu ketika itu ialah Korporal Khairuddin manakala ASP Tony
duduk di sebelah pemandu. Di belakang barisan tempat duduk

saya, adalah Janagaren dan jurugambar yang membawa kamera
video tersebut. Kenderaan Pajero kami bergerak secara konvoi
mengikuti kenderaan Pajero serta kenderaan-kenderaan pasukan
yang lain menuju ke Jalan Hang Tuah, Jalan Lapangan Terbang
Lama melintasi bangunana Dewan Bahasa Dan Pustaka, Jalan
Istana melintasi Istana Negara, Muzium negara, Jalan Duta dan
masuk ke susur lebuhraya NKVE di plaza tol Jalan Duta dan
keluar di plaza tol Kota Damansara. Selepas keluar dari plaza tol
tersebut, kami mengekori kenderaan-kenderaan pasukan yang lain
dan berhenti di luar kampus UiTM Puncak Alam. Sepanjang
perjalanan kami, saya tidak perasan jika ada sesiapa di dalam
kenderaan kami yang memandu arah perjalanan. Saya tidak berbuat
demikian dan saya tidak diminta berbuat demikian. Kemudian
konvoi kami bergerak semula daripada kampus UiTM Puncak
Alam menuju ke Klang. Tiba di satu simpang empat, konvoi
bergerak secara perlahan dan kenderaan Pajero yang saya naiki
terus melepasi simpang empat dan membelok ke sebelah kanan
memasuki satu lorong hutan. Di kawasan semak tersebut,
ASP Tony mengarahkan saya turun dari kenderaan. Kami
berlegar-legar selama lebih kurang 20 minit sebelum ASP Tony
mengarahkan saya naik semula ke kenderaan Pajero. Kenderaan
kami keluar semula dari kawasan tersebut. Tiba-tiba telefon bimbit
ASP Tony berdering, dan saya melihat ASP Tony menjawab
panggilan tersebut. Sejurus selepas panggilan tersebut, ASP Tony
menyatakan kepada ASP Zulkarnain dan pemandu bahawa “Ini
jalan silap”. ASP Tony mengarahkan pemandu menuju ke simpang
empat semula. Di simpang empat, pemandu kenderaan kami
membelok ke sebelah kiri jalan dan kami berhenti. Selepas itu,
ASP Tony sekali lagi menjawab telefon beliau yang berdering.
Selepas itu, ASP Tony mengarahkan pemandu untuk membelok ke
sebelah kiri sekali lagi ke dalam kawasan hutan. Kenderaan kami
mendaki bukit sehinggalah sampai ke satu kawasan lapang. Di
sana, saya dapat melihat sebuah Pajero pasukan berwarna biru
telahpun berada di kawasan lapang tersebut. Sebelum turun dari
kenderaan, saya dapat melihat Azilah, Chief Inspector (“C/I”)
Koh Fei Cheow, DSP Zainuddin serta beberapa orang lelaki
berpakaian preman telahpun berlegar-legar di kawasan lapang itu.
Saya hanya diarahkan oleh ASP Tony untuk turunkan dari Pajero
dan berdiri bersebelahan Pajero sahaja. Sewaktu hari hampir senja,
saya diminta naik semula ke dalam Pajero dan kenderaan kami
bertolak pulang ke IPK KL.
Pada 7.11.2006, saya dibawa keluar dari lokap lebih kurang jam
11.00 pagi untuk dibawa ke Mahkamah Majistret Kuala Lumpur
bagi tujuan reman. Setelah selesai urusan reman, saya dibawa ke
pejabat ASP Zulkarnain yang terletak di pejabat D9 IPK KL. Saya

sampai di pejabatnya dalam keadaan bergari dan melihat
ASP Zulkarnain telah berada di dalam biliknya bersama C/I
Koh Fei Cheow. Terdapat dua kerusi sahaja di dalam biliknya
yang agak sempit. ASP Zulkarnain duduk di kerusi di hadapan
mejanya dan saya diarahkan duduk menghadapnya sementara C/I
Koh Fei Cheow berdiri di sebelah ASP Zulkarnain pada ketika itu.
Ada ketikanya C/I Koh Fei Cheow keluar dan masuk ke dalam
bilik itu. ASP Zulkarnain sentiasa berada bersama saya sejak awal
sehingga akhir perjumpaan. Seingatan saya, C/I Koh Fei Cheow
banyak kali keluar dan masuk bilik tersebut dan setiap kali beliau
keluar, beliau berada di luar bilik di antara 4 ke 5 minit. Di dalam
bilik itu, ASP Zulkarnain ada bertanyakan soalan-soalan kepada
saya, saya menjawab mana yang saya tahu dan menyatakan tidak
tahu kepada soalan-soalan yang mana jawaban terhadapnya saya
tidak tahu. Dalam tempoh pertemuan saya dengannya, saya tidak
pernah menyatakan kepada ASP Zulkarnain bahawa saya ingin
membuat sebarang pendedahan. Saya juga sama sekali tidak
pernah menyatakan kepadanya yang saya ingin memberi sebarang
maklumat. Saya tahu apa itu “Amaran” (Caution). Di dalam
pertemuan saya dengan ASP Zulkarnain, beliau langsung tidak
membaca kepada saya “Amaran” tersebut. Setiap kali saya
menjawab tidak tahu kepada soalan-soalan beliau, ASP Zulkarnain
meninggikan suara dan pada satu ketika dalam nada suara yang
tinggi, beliau berkata “Kamu bercakaplah yang benar, apa yang
kamu tahu beritahulah saya, kamu adalah seorang anggota, kami
akan menolong kamu, hal ini tak akan dibawa ke Mahkamah”.
Saya hanya mendiamkan diri. Pada satu ketika yang lain,
ASP Zulkarnain ada meninggikan suara dan berkata dengan nada
yang tegas dan marah kepada saya “Engkau jangan buat aku
layan engkau macam OKT lain”. Masa itu mukanya merah, beliau
berdiri dan kemudian duduk semula. Saya takut beliau pukul saya
macam OKT lain. Saya terfikir kalau saya bukan anggota, sudah
tentu ASP Zulkarnain akan pukul saya. ASP Zulkarnain terus
mengajukan soalan-soalan kepada saya yang mana jawapannya
saya tidak tahu. Apabila saya terus-menerus menjawab tidak tahu,
ASP Zulkarnain bangun dan menghentak meja dan berkata
“Macam nilah Sirul, kalau kau setuju, engkau ikut aku, kau
camkan barang-barang tu, kau pegang dan tunjuk ke arah barang
itu sambil camera man ambil gambar, aku boleh tolong engkau
dan hal ini kita tidak akan bawa ke Mahkamah”. Semasa beliau
berkata begittu, C/I Koh Fei Cheow tiada di dalam bilik. Semasa
itu suara ASP Zulkarnain perlahan dan saya percaya beliau akan
menolong saya. Saya diamkan diri dan tidak bertanya apa-apa
tentang ke mana saya akan dibawa pergi dan apa maksud
ASP Zulkarnain tentang barang-barang yang beliau ingin saya
tunjukkan nanti.

Semasa di dalam bilik ASP Zulkarnain, saya tidak nampak sesiapa
menaip kecuali di akhir pertemuan bilamana ASP Zulkarnain
membuka laptop beliau dan menaip sesuatu. Ini berlaku selepas
ASP Zulkarnain bercakap dengan nada perlahan dan meminta saya
mengikut beliau mengecam barang-barang. Semasa itu saya tidak
melihat C/I Koh Fei Cheow apa-apa langsung, cuma beliau ada
membawa masuk sehelai A4 di atas arahan ASP Zulkarnain.
5 minit selepas ASP Zulkarnain selesai menaip saya dibawa keluar
oleh C/I Koh Fei Cheow ke bilik mesyuarat D9 dan ditinggalkan
di situ selama lebih kurang 20 minit. Selepas itu saya dibawa
turun oleh Korporal Chiam, ASP Zulkarnain, C/I Koh Fei Cheow
dan C/I Shawal menaiki lif ke sebuah kenderaan Pajero. Saya
mengikuti mereka tanpa bertanya apa-apa. Setelah menaiki Pajero
tersebut, pemandu iaitu Korporal Khairuddin telah memandu
menuju ke Jalan Duta kemudian ke susur masuk lebuhraya
NKVE, ke plaza tol Jalan Duta dan keluar melalui plaza tol Kota
Damansara. Semasa itu, saya merasakan mereka hendak menuju
ke kediaman saya. Terdapat sebuah kenderaan Volvo berwarna
putih berlambang PDRM mengekori Pajero kami. Apabila
diarahkan oleh ASP Zulkarnain, Pajero kami bergerak terus ke
kawasan flat tempat saya tinggal dan berhenti di bawah flat.
Semasa dalam perjalanan, tiada sesiapa bertanyakan saya lokasi
kediaman saya. Saya dan anggota di dalam Pajero hanya berbual
mengenai tugas-tugas UTK dan tugas-tugas di luar Negara. Saya
sendiri juga tidak ada memberitahu pegawai dan anggota mengenai
alamat rumah saya. Saya juga tidak diminta untuk memandu arah
ke kediaman saya di sepanjang perjalanan tersebut. Saya nampak
Unit Pemusnah Bom (UPB) bersama kereta Volvonya turut
berhenti di perkarangan flat kediaman saya. Selepas itu,
ASP Zulkarnain, C/I Koh Fei Cheow dan saya bersama anggota
lain keluar dari Pajero. Sepanjang perjalanan sehinggalah tiba di flat
kediaman saya, tangan saya sentiasa bergari ke tangan Korporal
Chiam. Di bawah flat, saya nampak pegawai dari UTK iaitu
DSP Yusri, Sarjan Rosli dan Sarjan Zafri turut berada di situ.
Saya nampak Sarjan Rosli mengeluarkan segenggam anak kunci
yang banyak dan menyerahkan kepada C/I Koh Fei Cheow.
Anak-anak kunci tersebut adalah di dalam satu rangkaian yang
berankum bersekali. Kunci untuk rumah saya ada banyak dan
bukannya serangkai tiga batang anak kunci seperti yang
ditunjukkan di dalam mahkamah. Saya melihat Sarjan Rosli
menyerahkan serangkai kunci tersebut kepada C/I Koh Fei Cheow
dan saya tahu ianya adalah kunci rumah saya kerana kunci rumah
saya telah lusuh warnanya dan bukannya berkilat seperti yang
ditunjukkan kepada saya di dalam Mahkamah. Kunci rumah saya
ini telah saya serahkan kepada ACP Mastor semasa saya dalam

penerbangan dari Islamabad ke KLIA. Selepas Sarjan Rosli
menyerahkan kunci, saya melihat C/I Koh Fei Cheow telah
serahkan pula kunci tersebut kepada ASP Zulkarnain. Selepas itu,
ASP Zulkarnain membawa saya naik ke atas diekori oleh C/I Koh
Fei Cheow, DSP Yusri, Sarjan Rosli dan Sarjan Zafri. Saya
mengekori mereka dari belakang dengan tangan bergari ke tangan
Korporal Chiam. Semasa naik ke atas pun, ASP Zulkarnain tidak
meminta daripada saya alamat tepat rumah saya. Semasa itu,
jurugambar Kamarulzaman, Khairuddin dan UPB belum naik lagi.
C/I Shawal naik bersama mengekori saya dari belakang. Kemudian
saya dibawa ke tingkat 3, sampai di hadapan di rumah saya
bernombor 5-3-7. Pintu rumah saya dibuka oleh ASP Zulkarnain
dan kesemua yang naik tadi masuk ke dalam rumah. ASP
Zulkarnain masuk dahulu dan kemudian mengarahkan saya dan
Korporal Chiam duduk di kerusi meja makan di ruang tamu.
Semasa itu, jurugambar Kamarulzaman belum naik lagi. Semasa
saya duduk di meja makan, ASP Zulkarnain masuk ke dalam bilik
tidur utama rumah saya diikuti oleh C/I Koh Fei Cheow, C/I
Shawal, DSP Yusri, Sarjan Rosli dan Sarjan Zafri. Kemudian
pintu bilik tidur utama ditutup. Kesemua mereka berada di dalam
bilik tersebut dalam keadaan pintu bilik tertutup selama hampir
sepuluh minit sementara saya dan Korporal Chiam masih duduk
di ruang meja makan. Semasa pintu bilik masih tertutup,
jurugambar Kamarulzaman naik ke rumah saya dan masuk ke
ruang tamu. UPB juga naik ke atas tetapi tidak masuk ke dalam
rumah. Lebih kurang sepuluh minit kemudian, pintu bilik tidur
utama dibuka dan saya nampak DSP Yusri, Sarjan Rosli dan
Sarjan Zafri keluar dari bilik tersebut membawa satu beg besar
dan dua beg yang lain keluar dari rumah saya. Pintu bilik tidur
utama ditutup semula. Lebih kurang 3 minit kemudian, ASP
Zulkarnain membuka pintu bilik utama dan memanggil saya
masuk. Saya dan Korporal Chiam masuk ke dalam bilik itu dan
saya telah diarahkan untuk berdiri di sebelah almari pakaian saya.
ASP Zulkarnain kemudiannya memanggil masuk jurugambar
Kamarulzaman yang berada di luar bilik. Di dalam bilik itu, ASP
Zulkarnaian berkata, “Ini jaket kamu, kamu pegang”. Semasa itu,
jurugambar dipanggil dan aksi-aksi yang diarahkan oleh ASP
Zulkarnain untuk saya lakukan telah dirakam oleh jurugambar.
Semasa saya mula masuk, saya nampak keadaan cadar katil saya
berselerak, pintu almari sedia terbuka dan kipas di ceiling sedia
berpusing. Apabila ASP Zulkarnain minta saya pegang jaket, saya
pun pegang dan ASP Zulkarnain dalam masa yang sama panggil
masuk jurugambar Kamarulzaman. Sementara Kamrulzaman
sedang masuk, saya lepaskan memegang jaket tersebut. Setelah

[2012] 1 CLJ

Kamarulzaman masuk, saya pegang semula jaket tersebut dan
gambar saya memegang jaket tersebut diambil oleh
Kamarulzaman. Sambil memegang jaket tersebut, saya tidak
berkata apa-apa.
Setelah itu, saya diarahkan berdiri di sisi katil. Saya lihat ASP
Zulkarnain keluarkan jaket yang saya pegang tadi dari dalam
almari dan mengambil sesuatu keluar dari dalam jaket. Jaket itu
dibentangkan di atas katil dan ASP Zulkarnain meletakkan barangbarang di atas jaket tersebut. ASP Zulkarnain mengarahkan saya
menunjukkan ke arah barang-barang tersebut, ASP Zulkarnain
berkata, “kamu tunjukkan barang-barang itu”. Saya kata “apa ni
Tuan”. Saya tidak mahu tunjukkan, ASP Zulkarnain minta saya
tunjukkan juga sambil berkata “kamu tunjuk sajalah Sirul”. Barulah
ketika itu saya tunjukkan sambil gambar saya itu diambil. Sambil
menunjukkan jari tangan saya ke arah barang-barang tersebut,
saya tidak berkata apa-apa. Selepas itu, saya diarahkan keluar
duduk di meja makan. Semasa saya di dalam bilik tersebut
sehinggalah saya dibawa keluar, mana-mana pegawai tidak ada
membacakan saya apa-apa “Amaran”. Selepas itu, dari rumah
saya, saya terus dibawa balik ke Bukit Aman.
Sebelum saya mengakhiri kenyataan ini, saya ingin menyatakan
bahawa saya tidak pernah mengenali mangsa di dalam kes ini dan
tidak pernah mempunyai sebarang urusan peribadi mahupun
sebaliknya dengan beliau. Saya juga tidak mengenali Abdul Razak
Bin Abdullah dan tidak pernah mempunyai sebarang urusan
dengan beliau sebelum kes ini. Saya merayu kepada Mahkamah ini
untuk mengambil kira bahawa sepanjang perbicaraan ini, saya telah
mengikuti prosiding ini dan menyaksikan bagaimana beberapa saksi
penting pendakwaan terutamanya saksi-saksi dari D9 IPK yang
mereka-reka cerita, tidak bercakap benar dan sentiasa merubahubah cerita mereka bila disoal balas. Saya melihat keadaan ini
dengan keprihatinan kerana bagi saya tindakan mereka ini
semata-mata bertujuan untuk mendapatkan sabitan terhadap saya
sebagai “kambing hitam” yang harus dikorbankan untuk
melindungi rancangan dan niat jahat mereka yang tidak berada di
dalam Mahkamah ini untuk menghadapi natijah daripada perlakuan
dan perancangan mereka. Saya tidak mempunyai sebarang sebab
untuk mencederakan apatah lagi mengambil nyawa mangsa dengan
begitu kejam. Saya merayu kepada Mahkamah ini yang kini
berada di dalam kedudukan dan mempunyai kuasa untuk
menentukan hidup dan mati saya, agar tidak menghukum saya
sekaligus menyempurnakan perencanaan mereka terhadap saya.

[149] Essentially, the second accused is saying that he was made
the “scapegoat” – that he did not utter all the statements relating
to those personal belongings of the deceased which were admitted
by this court as evidence of information leading to the discovery
of facts under s. 27 of Evidence Act. The second accused further
claimed that he was not at the scene of crime on the said date
and time but was instead having tea at Devi’s Corner in
Sri Hartamas and having ‘sahur’ at Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur.
He finally stressed as not true that first accused had handed over
to him the deceased for her to be sent back to Hotel Malaya.

Findings Of The Court

D

E

F

G

H

I

[150] Having heard the defence of the first and the second
accused, what is required of the court to decide at this stage,
is whether the prosecution in the light of the defence’s case, has
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt for the accused to be
found guilty and convicted as charged or whether the defence
have cast reasonable doubt which warrant their acquittal.
[151] The first accused did not call any of his witness to support
his defence and his alibi. The station diary (D428) was likewise
not formally proven. The law relating to the non calling of a
witness by the defence is well settled, ie, notwithstanding that,
it should not be made subject of adverse comment by the court
and that s. 114(g) of Evidence Act should not be invoked against
the accused person. The court must still consider whether he has
nevertheless succeeded in casting a reasonable doubt on the
prosecution’s case.
[152] The law relating to the weight to be attached to the
unsworn statement from the dock which is not subjected to cross
examination by the prosecution, is likewise settled, ie,
notwithstanding that the weight to be attached to this category
of defence may not be the same as one attached to the defence
upon evidence on oath, but the court must no reject it ipso facto,
instead must consider it for whatever it worth having regard to the
other evidence available and to see whether the defence has
succeeded in casting a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s
case.
[153] I have kept at the forefront of my mind of the two
aforesaid principles in considering the respective defence of these
two accused persons.

[2012] 1 CLJ

Conclusion
[154] Having heard the submission of both the defence and the
prosecution and having considered and tested the defence put up
by both the first and second accused person, individually and
jointly against the totality of the evidence for the prosecution,
I find that the defence of each of the accused have essentially
been one of denial, of blaming one another, irreconcilable and
ambivalent. Consequently they have failed to raise any reasonable
doubt on the prosecution’s case. To respectfully paraphrase the
famous words of Thomson CJ in Chan Chwen Kong v. PP [1962]
1 LNS 22, ie, the several strands of physical and circumstantial
evidence of the prosecution have remained unrebutted,
unexplained and unanswered by both accused persons. The
combined strength of those strands of evidence when twisted
together has formed two ropes, strong enough to hang each
accused person.
[155] I am satisfied therefore that the prosecution has proved the
case against both the first and the second accused beyond
reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I find both them guilty and
convicted as charged. I thereby sentenced both the first and the
second accused to death and order both of them to be kept in
the lawful custody until they are brought to a lawful place where
they will be hung by their neck until they are dead.
