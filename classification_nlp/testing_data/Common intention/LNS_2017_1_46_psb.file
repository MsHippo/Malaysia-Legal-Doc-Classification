JUDGMENT
[1]

The accused Tee Chih Wei (“OKT1”), Izwan Bin Mohamad
(“OKT2”) and Kasful Anuar Bin Ghazali (“OKT3”) [collectively
referred to as “the accused persons”] were charged with the
murder of one Ong Chee Leong (“the deceased”). The murder
was said to have been committed by the accused persons
together in furtherance of their common intention under s. 34 of
the Penal Code (“PC”).

The charge reads as follows:
“Bahawa kamu pada 8 Julai 2012 jam lebih kurang 10.45

This trial was partly heard by the previous learned Judicial
Commissioner (“the learned JC”) before it adjourned at the stage
of cross-examination of the main witness (PW4) where the said
learned JC was subsequently transferred to the Kuala Lumpur
High Court. When I took over and presided on the continuing
trial of this case on 11 January 2016, the respective learned
counsels had no objection for me to proceed with the trial,
provided that their request for the hearing dates be vacated to
enable them to write to the Right Honourable Chief Judge of
Malaya requesting for the learned JC to continue this part heard,
be recorded. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) on
the other hand had no objection to either the part heard be
postponed or for me to proceed. I have duly examined the notes
of evidence and I concluded that the learned JC didn’t state any
comments or remark regarding the demeanour of PW4 or any of
the other witnesses [s. 271 Criminal Procedure Code –
(“CPC”)]. After careful deliberation and taking into
consideration that this is a capital punishment case, time is of
paramount importance. The right to recall witnesses as provided
for under s. 261 CPC was not invoked by any of the respective
counsels. It was my judicious observation and decision that none
of the parties would be prejudiced thereof and consequently
therefore I proceeded to preside over this part heard.

After the conclusion of the trial and on 11 November 2016, I
acquitted and discharged all accused persons (OKT1, OKT2 and
OKT3) after hearing and deliberating on their defence. On 18
November 2016, the learned Public Prosecutor filled an appeal
against the said decision.

THE PROSECUTION CASE
[5]

The prosecution called twenty-six (26) witnesses. The facts
established by the prosecution through their witnesses were
these. On 8 July 2012, at about 10.00 am, Ang Ah Choo (PW12)
and her daughter (not called as a witness) went to Fong Soon
Furniture Trading in Taiping (“the said furniture shop”) to buy a
mattress. There was a man (later known as “the deceased”) and a
woman (later known as “the deceased’s wife”) in the said
furniture shop. According to PW12, the man was outside the
shop when PW12 together with the woman went to the back of
the shop into an office space to look at a computer chair since
she was also interested to buy a computer chair.

[6]

While in the office, PW12 heard noises which she described as
sounding like “pranng, pranng” together with the sound of
falling items. At PW12’s instigation, the deceased’s wife went
outside to find out what had happened. Not long thereafter, the
deceased’s wife ran back into the office followed by two masked
men whom PW12 said appeared to be Malay men. The men
broke the office’s glass window, with one of them waving a
knife while uttering in Malay, “duit mari-duit mari”, while the
other ransacked the office. PW12 covered her face with her
hands as she was too scared to look. Not long after that PW12
heard one of them said “Jom” and they left the office. The
deceased’s wife told PW12 that the two men took her computer

4



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

and her bag. PW12 and the deceased’s wife went out from the
office and saw the deceased bloodied body lying on the floor.
The deceased’s wife asked PW12’s daughter to call her
daughter. The woman’s daughter came and PW12 and her
daughter left the furniture shop. PW12 didn’t identify any of the
accused and neither did she lodge any police report regarding
this incident. The deceased’s wife (later known as Kok Kwee
Lan) and step daughter (later known as Woon Yit Wen and also
as OKT1’s girlfriend, named Xiao Mei) were not called as
witnesses because according to the ASP Seah Chong Seng
[PW26-Investigating Officer (IO)], they could not be found. It is
to be noted at this stage that the application to admit their s. 112
statements were rejected by this court. I will address this issue
later.
[7]

Kek Eng Seng (PW15) is the owner of a car repair workshop
located opposite the said furniture shop. On 8 July 2012 (he
opened his workshop after 9.00am), PW15 heard loud noises as
if someone was quarrelling at the furniture shop, the sound of
broken glasses and knocking of wall. He went to the shop to
check and from across the street, he saw a Malay man came out
holding a knife. According to PW15, the Malay man was
walking towards a Citra model car (parked in front of the
furniture shop), silver in colour bearing registration number
4004. This Malay man however turned back towards the
furniture shop and later PW15 heard woman’s scream and he
saw the Malay coming out from the furniture shop followed by
another Malay man who was also holding a knife. The men
entered the car from the left side of the car and drove away. In
open court, PW15 identified OKT2 as the person he first saw
holding the knife even though during cross examination, PW15
admitted that he can only identified 30% of OKT2 during the ID
parade that is as regards to OKT2’s face and body size only.

According to ASP Abang Kaderi bin Abang Wasli (PW11), the
said ID parade was held on 23 July 2012 and the ID parade
report was tendered as exhibit P38. PW11 affirmed that during
the ID parade, PW15 had only managed to identify 30% of
OKT2 as the man who was at the crime scene on that day that is
as regards to the chin and body size only.

[9]

Lau Choon Wei (PW4) is the main witness in this trial, narrated
the several meetings he had with OKT1. According to PW4,
OKT1 had a girlfriend in Taiping who was always abused by his
step father (the deceased). Hence OKT1 had asked PW4 to help
him find someone to assist him to kill the deceased person who
lives in Taiping. PW4 then introduced OKT1 to OKT2 and was
later introduced to OKT3. Before leaving for Taiping, OKT1
gave PW4 a sum of RM6,000.00 for safe keeping which was
later to be given to OKT2 and OKT3 as a reward (ganjaran).
OKT1 has also requested PW4 to prepare drugs eramine, syabu
and cash of RM500.00 for expenses to go to Taiping. OKT1
(driving the Naza Citra), OKT2 and OKT3 eventually left for
Taiping at night.

[10] On 8 July 2012 at about 9.00 am, OKT1 called PW4 and
confirmed that they are now in Taiping and waiting for time
(menunggu masa). At about 11.00 am, PW4 received a call from
a person named Ah Liang who informed him that the step father
of OKT1’s girlfriend was robbed and killed. At about 2.00 pm
OKT1 called PW4 and said they are on their way back to Johor
from Taiping. At about 9-10 pm OKT1 gave PW4 a hand carry
bag, licence and identity card of the deceased’s wife for PW4’s
safe keeping. OKT1 had also asked PW4 to dispose of the Naza
Citra which PW4 refused. After 2-3 days, sensing that
something was not right, PW4 asked to meet with OKT1, OKT2
and OKT3 (all three were identified by PW4). During this
6



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

meeting OKT2 gave him a Dell branded laptop which according
to OKT2 he had brought it from Taiping. PW4 identified OKT1
as similar to the man in the CCTV recording marked as ID13
(later marked as exhibit P13), PW4 identified OKT2 as the man
in the CCTV recording marked as ID14 (later marked as exhibit
P14). PW4 has also identified OKT1 at the petrol pump and
OKT2 while walking to the Naza Citra (the car used by the
accused persons to go to Taiping) in the CCTV recording
marked as ID15 (later marked as exhibit P15). PW4 has also
identified OKT2 on the day he gave RM6,000.00 to OKT2, in
the CCTV recording marked as ID12 (later marked as exhibit
P12). (I observed that from P12, the date of recording stated as
12 July 2012). On the day PW4 was arrested he had asked his
wife to destroy and burned the above items which his wife did
(PW4’s wife Choi Pei Chyn was identified by PW4 but not
called as a witness).
[11] Dr Mohammad Shafie bin Othman@Osman (PW9) conducted the
post-mortem on the deceased on 9 July 2012 at 9.00 a.m. at the
Forensic Department, Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital, Ipoh.
PW9 affirmed that the cause of the deceased’s death was 4 stabwounds to his neck and chest. According to PW9, the incisions
and stab-wounds injuries suffered by the deceased were
consistent with that of the injuries caused by flat, sharp and
pointed object. The deceased was said to have died 12 hours
before post-mortem was done. PW9 prepared and documented
his findings in the post-mortem report (exhibit P37).
[12] ASP Mohd Hasni bin Mohd Nasir [(SP17) - Pegawai Penyiasat
Tempat Kejadian] upon instruction from PW26, went to the
crime scene and arrived around 12.10 pm. He managed to lift 4
finger prints at the crime scene, three finger prints on the glass
door of the office marked as C1, C2, C3 and a finger print on the
7

Legal Network Series

cupboard near the deceased marked as C4. According to Sjn Mat
Radzi bin Abdul Aziz (SP21), C1-C4 were sent to Bukit Aman
for thumb print comparison and identification. Ng Sman bin
Saring (SP14), by referring to his report (exhibit P41) confirmed
that the finger print “C3” found at the crime scene belongs to
OKT3. Insp Vijaraj a/l Rajamurthi (SP23) had seized a pair of
Nike shoes and a pair of shorts from a person by the name of
Lasmirah (not called as a witness). Erizasyira bt Basri [(SP8)Chemist] by referring to her report (exhibit P18) confirmed that
the blood stain found on the said Nike shoes was that of the
deceased. Dr Chong Xiao Yuan (PW19) confirmed that the blood
sample exhibit P48A belongs to OKT3. During cross
examination, PW26 however admitted that OKT3’s DNA was
not found in the shoes and he admitted that he cannot confirmed
that the shoes belongs to OKT3.
[13] On 8 July 2012, Kop RF Suhaili Ahmad (PW3) was on duty at
the Bilik Gerakan IPD Taiping from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. He
received a phone call from a person named Fauzi (cannot be
identified and not called as a witness) informing him of a
robbery whereby a Chinese man was badly injured, believed to
have been caused by a sharp object. PW3 then informed the
MPV to go the location. Insp Suhaini bin Mohamed [(PW7)- IO
on duty] upon receiving the instruction from Bilik Gerakan,
went to the furniture shop together with Kop Mohd Fauzi bin
Abd Jabar [(PW1-photographer]. PW7 saw a man lying in a pool
of blood whom PW7 believed to have died. During cross PW7
admitted that when he received the instruction to go to the crime
scene he was informed that it was a robbery. After informing
PW26, PW7 then went to the Hospital Bainun together with Sjn
Razali bin Seman [(PW2)-photographer], to attend the post
mortem on the deceased.

[14] Steven Anthony Soosay (PW22) is a Safety and Security
Manager of Starbuck Malaysia and through this witness, the
CCTV recording of Starbuck in Jusco Tebrau Johor was
tendered and marked as P60(A-C) (3 folders). Lau Chin Seng
(PW24) owns a car accessories business in Kulai Johor.
According to PW24, OKT1 (PW24’s customer) did bring a silver
coloured Naza Citra to his shop to change the plate number of
the car. He can’t remember the number that was changed but he
confirmed that the new plate number was different from the
plate number on the said car.
S. 112 Statements Of Two Other Witnesses Who Were At The
Furniture Shop On 8 July 2012
[15] According to PW26, police were unable to serve the subpoenas
to Kok Kwee Lan and Woon Yit Wen because they were unable
to locate these two witnesses. At this juncture, the learned TPR
applied to tender the s. 112 statements made by Kok Kwee Lan
and Woon Yit Wen. On being questioned from the learned TPR
on the efforts he took to locate these two witnesses, PW26 said
he had posted an advertisement in Harian Metro dated 14 March
2016, marked as exhibit P78 and in Sin Chew Jit Poh dated 15
March 2016, marked as exhibit P79.
[16] According to PW26, Kok Kwee Lan’s statement was recorded
three times because of several questions that needed
clarification from this witness. PW26 further stated that upon
his instruction, PW7 went to Johor to Kok Kwee Lan’s
hometown and two other known addresses, her father’s address
and her daughter’s address but fail to locate Kok Kwee Lan.
PW26 said that Kok Kwee Lan and Woon Yit Wen were released
under s. 118 CPC and the bon of attendance for Kok Kwee Lan

9



[2017] 1 LNS 46

and Woon Yit Wen were tendered and marked P80 and P81
respectively. The learned counsels objected to the tendering of
Kok Kwee Lan’s and Woon Yit Wen’s s. 112 statements, on
grounds that the requirements of section 32 of the Evidence Act
was not fulfilled. The TPR and the learned counsels then
submitted on this issue.
[17] After hearing the said submissions I made the following
findings:
(a)

This trial had started in 2015 and it was only now that
efforts were made to trace these witnesses.

(b)

PW26 had only made efforts through advertisement on
March 2016 and gave instruction to his officers to look for
these witnesses. From the facts made available to the
court, I find the police failed to exhaust all reasonable
steps to locate these witnesses.

(c)

The importance of these two witnesses must have been
realised after their s. 112 statements were recorded but
however, action to locate them were only taken during this
trial and obviously at the eleventh hour when in fact their
recorded statements were taken four years ago, and such
lackadaisical approach in a murder trial under s. 302 of the
Penal Code is unacceptable. I would expect greater efforts
and commitment to be made by the prosecution to find and
produce such important witnesses for the trial of this case.
In short the gravity of this case demands greater effort.

(d)

I refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in PP v. Lee
Jun Ho [2011] 6 MLJ 220 where Raus Sharif JCA said:
“We are in complete agreement with the reasoning of the
learned trial judge. The basis upon which the prosecution
10



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

tried to invoke s. 32(1)(i) of the Evidence Act was that the
two witnesses could not be found. However, as pointed out
by the learned trial judge, actions to trace the two
witnesses were only taken in 2008, while in the midst of
the trial. The actions were taken five years after recording
the witnesses' statements. Thus, as rightly pointed out by
the learned trial judge, greater efforts was expected to
secure the attendance of the witnesses in such a serious
charge. In the absent of such effort, we are of the same
view with the learned trial judge that the witnesses'
statements of the two key witnesses could not be admitted
under s. 32(1)(i) of the Evidence Act”.
The decision of the COA is binding on this court. Based on the
above reasons, the application to admit the s. 112 statements by
Kok Kwee Lan and Woon Yit Wen are not allowed.
Submissions at The End of The Prosecution’s Case
[18] Briefly, the learned counsel for OKT1 submitted that the
prosecution relied on the evidence of the main witness that is
PW4. However, from the evidence of PW4, clearly, he is an
accomplice because he did all the acts to assist in the murder.
The counsel further submitted that PW4 is not a reliable witness
because he didn’t lodge any police report. His evidence must be
corroborated which in the present case, no corroboration was
offered. The learned counsel submitted that PW12 was a
customer and PW15 was the person outside the shop who saw
OKT2 coming out and entered a car. However, PW15
contradicted his story when during the ID parade where PW15
identified only 30% of OKT2 (figure and the chin only). The
reason given by PW15 was that he was scared that something

11



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

might happen to him but the counsel further submitted that
despite this fact, the police didn’t record s. 112 statement from
PW15. The fact remains that PW15 had only identified 30% of
OKT2 during the ID Parade.
[19] Regarding the car said to be used by the accused persons, the
counsel submitted that PW15 in his evidence had only
mentioned Citra and not Naza Citra. He submitted that Naza
Citra came about because the IO had inquired from SM Chan
Kok Choon (PW20) and it was PW20 who reported that there
was a Naza Citra WMT 4004 entering the highway heading
south at 10.59 am, this is clearly hearsay evidence because
although PW20 was called as a witness, PW20 did not testify to
this fact. In the circumstances, what the IO had said related to
what PW20 had said which clearly constituted hearsay evidence.
There was another person who saw the accused persons that is
Tan Bee Yee but her evidence was ignored and she was not
called as a witness.
[20] The counsel further submitted that the IO investigated Naza
Citra with registration number WMT 4004 seen entering the
highway with an assumption that the said car was driven by
OKT1. However, from the CCTV recording, the Naza Citra
bearing registration number WQD 166 was apparently driven by
OKT1 and it has nothing to do with the other car bearing
registration number WMT 4004 that was being investigated. The
learned counsel had also submitted that the evidence of the
PW26 is hearsay because he relied on the evidence of these two
witnesses (PW12 and PW15).
[21] Briefly, the learned counsel for OKT2 (adopted the submission
by the counsel for OKT1) submitted that PW4 did not received
the information that a murder had happened from the accused

12



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

persons but rather from Ah Liang and the court must judiciously
appraise the reliability of PW4. The evidence on the weapon
used adduced through PW12 and PW15 postulates that the man
entering the furniture shop was supposedly wearing a mask and
gloves, but however, nothing was offered in evidence.
[22] Briefly, the learned counsel for the OKT3 (adopted the
submissions by the counsel for OKT1 and OKT2) submitted that
the fact that the finger print of OKT3 was at the furniture shop
doesn’t mean that he was at the crime scene when the murder
was committed.
[23] The learned DPP submitted that the evidence of PW4 could be
relied upon and the fact that the accused persons and PW4 knew
each other. From the meetings they had, it showed that there was
in fact a plan and intention to kill the deceased. The learned
DPP admitted that the prosecution is relying on circumstantial
evidence but the evidence support the inference that all the
accused persons were involved in the said murder. Their
movement to Taiping and the evidence from PW4 showed that
there was in fact a common intention to kill the deceased. The
evidence is supported by the recording of the CCTV that shows
the movement of the accused persons from Johor to Taiping.
[24] The learned DPP further submitted that based on the facts
adduced the court could make an inference from the aforesaid
meetings that the accused persons went to Taiping to commit
murder. Though evidence might show that at the beginning that
was not the intention but the evidence has shown otherwise.
PW15 gave evidence of the appearance of two Malay men after a
commotion. The Naza Citra was driven by OKT1 and this is
consistent with the evidence of PW4 that had seen all three
accused persons leaving for Taiping in the said Naza Citra. The

13



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

fact that the car was driven by OKT1 is supported by the
evidence of PW15.
[25] The learned DPP further submitted that the investigation of
PW26 showed the movement of Naza Citra bearing registration
number WQD 166 entering the tol plaza and exiting at the Tol
Plaza Changkat Jering as Naza Citra bearing the registration
number WMT 4004. And this fact is supported by the evidence
of PW15 who said Naza Citra bearing the registration number of
4004 was seen leaving the crime scene on that day. The learned
DPP admitted that Naza Citra bearing registration number WQD
166 could not be located until today. This fact is supported by
the evidence of PW4 when he said that OKT1 had asked him to
dispose of the Naza Citra that OKT1 had used on that particular
day.
[26] The learned DPP also submitted that the ID parade is the
important element to tie OKT2 to this charge. The evidence of
PW15 is consistent when he was able to identify OKT2 as the
person who left the furniture shop that particular morning. The
explanation by PW15 that he can only identify OKT2 at 30%
was due to his own safety is reasonable and ought to be
accepted. All the more so when PW15 was unable to identify the
other OKT, as this would go to show that PW15 did not concoct
a story regarding OKT2. If he had in fact made up the story,
why was it that he could not identify the other OKT? All these
would go to show that PW15 was in fact telling the truth. The
learned DPP urged the court to accept PW15 identification of
OKT2 even though at 30%.
[27] The forensic evidence regarding the finger print of OKT3 at the
crime scene is material and OKT3 ought to be called for defence
and explained why his finger print was found at the crime scene.

14



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

Regarding the shoes that was seized by PW7, the learned DPP
submitted that ownership of the shoes is not an issue because it
was a recovery under section 27of Evidence Act.
[28] The shoes was seized from the house that OKT3 lives in and it is
for the OKT3 to explain why the blood of the deceased was
found on his shoes. The learned DPP submitted that obviously
OKT3 was at the crime scene during the murder and that is why
the traces of blood of the deceased could be found on the said
shoes. The learned DPP also submitted that all the planning and
the execution all goes to show that all three accused had the
common intention to kill the deceased.
The Law
[29] Section 180 of the CPC provides that when the case for the
prosecution is concluded, the court must consider whether the
prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the accused.
And if the court finds that the prosecution has not made out a
prima facie case against the accused, the court shall record an
order of acquittal. If the court finds that a prima facie case has
been made out against the accused on the offence charged the
court shall call upon the accused to enter on his defence. A
prima facie case is made out against the accused where the
prosecution has adduced credible evidence proving each
ingredient of the offence which if unrebutted or unexplained
would warrant a conviction. Based on the established principle
of law, before the court can rule that a prima facie case has been
made out, a maximum evaluation of the credibility of the
witnesses must be done at the close of the case for the
prosecution (Balachandaran v. PP [2005] 1 CLJ 85; Looi Kow

15



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Chai & Anor v. PP [2003] 1 CLJ 734; [2003] 2 MLJ 65 and PP
v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ 457).
[30] Maximum evaluation means the assessment process for the
essential purpose of analysing the credibility and reliability as
well as trustworthiness of the evidence of the prosecution.
Credible evidence is evidence which has been filtered and which
has gone through the process of evaluation and any evidence
which is not safe to be acted upon should be rejected (PP v. Ong
Cheng Heong [1998] 4 CLJ 209). Thus, what is required by a
trial court is to test the evidence of a witness from all angles as
well as its reliability and credibility by taking into account the
entire evidence placed before the court. The evidence must not
be accepted at face value but has to be tested and evaluated
before reliance can be placed on the particular evidence.
Further, the trial court has the duty to consider the evidence
which favours the defence. This requires a consideration of the
existence of any reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution
and if there is any such doubt, there can be no prima facie case
(Balachandran v. PP (supra)).
[31] The above principle of law on maximum evaluation should be
read together with the principle relating to judicial appreciation
of evidence which is set out in the following words of Gopal Sri
Ram JCA in Lee Ing Chin & Ors v. Gan Yook Chin & Anor
[2003] 2 CLJ 19; [2003] 2 MLJ 97. A trier of fact who makes
findings based purely upon the demeanour of a witness without
undertaking a critical analysis of that witness’s evidence runs
the risk of having his findings corrected on appeal. It does not
matter whether the issue for decision is one that arises in a civil
or criminal case, the approach to judicial appreciation of
evidence is the same.

The Court’s Findings At The Prosecution Case
[32] The prosecution has to prove the following ingredients:
(i)

the death of Ong Chee Leong (“the deceased”) had taken
place;

(ii)

the deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him;

(iii) the injuries of the deceased were caused by or the results
of the acts of the accused persons; and
(iv) the death of the deceased was caused in furtherance of
common intention between the accused persons.
(i)

The Death Of Ong Chee Leong (“The Deceased”)

(ii)

The Deceased Died As A Result Of Injuries Sustained By Him

[33] I find the first two ingredients were proven and it is not in
dispute that the deceased was one Ong Chee Leong [identified
by his son Ong Wooi Loon-(PW6)] and he died due to the
injuries that were inflicted on him. The deceased’s cause of
death was certified and confirmed by PW9 who conducted a
post-mortem on the deceased (exhibit P37).
(iii) The Injuries of The Deceased Were Caused by or the Results
of the Acts of the Accused Persons
[34] Upon the maximum evaluation of the evidence, I am satisfied
that the injuries of the deceased were caused by or the results of
the acts of the accused persons. I relied on the evidence of
PW12 and PW15 that OKT2 & OKT3 were both holding knives
during the incident. I take note that PW4 didn’t supply the
knives to the accused however I find that this fact failed to
negate the fact that the injuries suffered by the deceased was
17



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

from a flat, sharp object which I can safely infer as a knife
(exhibit 37).
[35] Further, I find that the evidence in respect of this element comes
almost solely from the direct evidence of PW4. PW4 who
oversaw the preparation and the planning to kill the deceased
that had involved all the accused persons. I agree that since PW4
was involved with the accused person from the planning stage,
looking for and securing OKT2 and OKT3 to assist OKT1 in
killing the deceased, holding the RM6,000.00 and then giving it
to OKT2 after the murder was carried out.
[36] All the above act support the submission that PW4 was in fact
an accomplice. However the evidence of an accomplice has to be
corroborated. I am satisfied that the evidence of PW4 is
supported/corroborated by the evidence of CCTV where PW4
identified the car Naza Citra used by the three accused persons
to go to Taiping. PW4 identified OKT2 coming out from the car
and identified OKT1 pumping the petrol into the car. PW4 had
also confirmed that the Naza Citra that he saw in the CCTV is
the same Naza Citra that was used by the three accused persons
when they left Johor Bahru for Taiping. I find that the IC and
licence belonging to the deceased’s wife were not disputed
evidence. I also find that the evidence of PW4 is supported by
the evidence of PW12 who was at the scene and confirmed that
the deceased’s wife had lost her bag and laptop on that day.
[37] It is clear that the prosecution had relied on the evidence of
PW4 regarding the involvement of all the accused persons right
from the planning to the execution thereof. The defence had
urged the court to disregard the evidence of PW4 for
inconsistency with no other supporting evidence. I agree that the
evidence of PW4 are at times inconsistent but there is no rule of

18



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its
entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent, for good and
cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness
and to reject the other. It is, therefore, necessary to scrutinize
each evidence very carefully as this involves the question of
weight to be given to certain evidence in which it is given or
arises.
[38] The function of the court in a criminal trial is to find whether
the person arraigned before it as the accused is guilty of the
offence with which he is charged. For this purpose, the court
scans the material on record to find whether there is any reliable
and trustworthy evidence upon the basis of which it is possible
to anchor the conviction of the accused and to hold that he is
guilty of the offence with which he is charged.
[39] I find support in the following cases. In the case of Che Omar
bin Akhir v. PP [1999] 2 MLJ 689 where COA held that:
“(1) Adalah salah untuk berkata bahawa hanya kerana
seorang saksi mungkin memberikan keterangan yang
bercanggah atau menipu sekali dua, keterangannya patut
ditolak sepenuhnya. Di dalam fakta, hakim perbicaraan
telah menilai dengan betul dan mempertimbangkan
keterangan saksi-saksi yang material dan berhak untuk
membuat pendapatnya sama ada untuk menerima atau
menolak keterangan mereka”
In the celebrated case of PP v. Datuk Harun Bin Haji Idris [No.
2] [1976] 1 LNS 184 HRH, the late Raja Azlan Shah said:
“There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness
must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court
is fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept

19



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the
other. It is, therefore, necessary to scrutinize each
evidence very carefully as this involves the question of
weight to be given to certain evidence in particular
circumstances.”
In the case of PP v. Lee Eng Kooi [1993] 2 MLJ 322, it was held
that:
“The function of the court in a criminal trial is to find
whether the person arraigned before it as the accused is
guilty of the offence with which he is charged. For this
purpose, the court scans the material on record to find
whether there is any reliable and trustworthy evidence
upon the basis of which it is possible to found the
conviction of the accused and to hold that he is guilty of
the offence with which he is charged”
[40] I find that the evidence of the witnesses above were consistent
and clearly showed that the OKT1, OKT2 and OKT3 were
involved in the murder. The evidence of PW4 were consistent in
showing that there were in fact discussion, preparation and
execution of the plan to kill the deceased person. I find that
there is no reason for me to make a finding that the evidence of
PW4, PW12 and PW15 as stated in the above were not
acceptable as credible evidence. Hence I find the evidence of the
prosecution witnesses are reliable and trustworthy.

(iv) The Death of the Deceased Was Caused In Furtherance of
Common Intention between the Accused Persons
[41] The charge against the accused persons was under s. 302 read
together with s. 34 of the Penal Code (“PC”) where they were
said to have committed the crime in furtherance of their common
intention.
[42] S. 34 PC lays down only a rule of evidence to infer joint
responsibility for a criminal act performed by a plurality of
persons. This section is drafted in such a way so as to meet
situations where it would be difficult to identify the exact acts
of individual members of a party who acted in furtherance of
their common intention. It allows for the imposition of the
liability of the person who actually perpetrated the crime on to a
participant whose participation contributed to the result, though
he could not be proved to have committed the actus reus
himself.
[43] On a charge involving common intention, the prosecution has to
show that there was a pre-arranged plan to commit the crime and
the crime forming the subject matter of the charge was done in
concert pursuant to that pre-arranged plan. Further on, from the
principle laid down in the case of Mahbub Shah v. King Emperor
[1945] AIR PC 118, pre-arrangement need not exist in the sense
of a prior plan. The plan may develop on the spot. Again, the
forensic evidence specifically one of the fingerprints lifted at
the furniture shop belongs to OKT3. I find that the accused
persons, whether actively or passively, had participated in one
way or another, in the act constituting the offence. I opined so
because the OKT2 and OKT3 had left the crime scene in a car
that was driven by another person which I can safely infer it was
OKT1 because of the evidence of PW4 who identified the three

21



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

accused persons as persons who was in the Naza Citra and
evidence of PW23 who confirmed through CCTV recording that
the accused persons were at the Petronas Skudai, Johor Bahru
[refer to his police report exhibit P68 and P14 (CCTV
recording)]. From all of these facts and circumstances adduced
before this court I hold that it is safe to conclude that the
element of common intention existed amongst the accused
persons to commit the said crime.
[44] At the end of the prosecution case, the court’s duty is to decide
whether the prosecution has succeeded in proving a prima facie
case against the accused persons as provided for under section
180 CPC. In Looi Kow Chai v. PP (supra), Court of Appeal said:
“It is the duty of a judge sitting alone to determine at the
close of the prosecution’s case, as a trier of fact, whether
the prosecution had made out a prima facie case. He must
subject the prosecution evidence to maximum evaluation
and ask himself whether he would be prepared to convict
the accused on the totality of the evidence contained in the
prosecution’s case if he were to decide to call upon the
accused to enter his defence and the accused had elected
to remain silent. If the answer to that question is in the
negative, then no prima facie case would have been made
out and the accused would be entitled to an acquittal.
There was no burden on the prosecution to prove its case
beyond a reasonable doubt at the close of the
prosecution’s case”.
In Balachandran v. PP (supra), Federal Court decided as
follows:
“A prima facie case is one that is sufficient for the
accused to answer, and the evidence adduced must be such
22



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

that it can only be surmounted by evidence in rebuttal. The
force of that evidence must, if unrebutted, be sufficient to
induce a state of belief that the facts as they stand are as
stated in the charge. In order to make a finding the court
must, at the close of the prosecution’s case, undertake a
positive evaluation of the credibility and reliability of all
the evidence adduced to determine whether all the
elements of the offence have been established. If the
evidence is unrebutted, and the accused remain silent, he
must be convicted. Therefore, the test to be applied at the
end of the prosecution’s case is whether there is sufficient
evidence to convict the accused if he chooses to remain
silent, which if answered in the affirmative means that a
prima facie case has been made out. This requires a
consideration of the existence of any reasonable doubt in
the prosecution’s case, which if it exists, cannot lead to
the finding of a prima facie case having been made out.”
In Jee Chai Foo v. PP [2014] 6 MLRA Court of Appeal said:
“(1) By virtue of s. 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code
(‘CPC’), when the case for the prosecution is concluded,
the court must consider whether the prosecution has made
out a prima facie case against the accused. Section 180 (4)
of the CPC provides that a prima facie case is made out
against the accused where the prosecution has adduced
credible evidence proving each ingredient of the offence
which if unrebutted or unexplained would warrant a
conviction. A maximum evaluation of the credibility of the
witnesses must be done at the close of the case for the
prosecution before the court can rule that a prima facie
case has been made out. Maximum evaluation is the
assessment process for analysing the credibility and

23



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

reliability as well as the trustworthiness of the evidence of
the prosecution. Credible evidence is evidence which has
been filtered and which has gone through the process of
evaluation. Any evidence which is not safe to be acted
upon should be rejected. It is also the duty of the trial
court to consider the evidence which favours the defence.”
[45] Based on the above and after a maximum evaluation of the
evidence tendered by the prosecution I find that the prosecution
has proven a prima facie case against the accused persons and
the accused persons were therefore called to enter their defence
against the said charge. After giving the accused persons the
three options available to them, they choose to give evidence on
oath.
The Defence Case
[46] Before going into the detail of the defence forwarded by the
accused persons, this court must reiterate that at this stage the
burden to prove the guilt of the accused persons remained with
the prosecution and that burden is one beyond reasonable doubt.
The burden never shifted to the accused persons. The accused
persons needed only to raise a reasonable doubt on the rest of
the prosecution case for them to earn an acquittal. This court
must evaluate the defence in light of the prima facie evidence
already proven at the prosecution stage. At this juncture, the
accused persons must raise a reasonable doubt on the truth of
the prosecution case.
[47] All of the accused persons in their defence consistently denied
that they have the common intention to kill the deceased person.
OKT1 in his defence admitted that he has a girlfriend by the
name of Xiao Mei/Woon Yit Wen. Their relationship was not
24



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

approved by Xiao Mei’s step father (the deceased). Since Xiao
Mei defied her step-father, she was always scolded and hit by
the deceased. OKT1 admitted that he had on occasions, warned
the deceased to treat Xiao Mei and Xiao Mei’s mother better but
it was ignored and the said abuse continued. About two months
before the incident, OKT1 met his friend by the name of
Albert/Lau Choon Wei (PW4) and informed him that OKT1 must
warn the deceased to stop abusing Xiao Mei and her mother and
to treat them better. PW4 agreed to help OKT1 and will look for
people to assist OKT1 to warn the deceased. OKT1 then gave
PW4 RM6,000.00 to help him finds these persons.
[48] OKT1 was then introduced to OKT2 and eventually OKT3
(OKT3 was brought in by OKT2 to assist him). OKT1, OKT2
and OKT3 then left for Taiping but dropped off OKT2 in Kuala
Lumpur and OKT1 and OKT3 then proceeded to Taiping.
However before they reached Taiping, a person by the name of
Ah Liang called OKT1 and informed him that the deceased was
robbed and killed on that day. OKT1 and OKT2 then decided to
abandon their trip to Taiping and made a u-turn back to Kuala
Lumpur. OKT1 denied that he went to Taiping.
[49] OKT2 in his evidence affirmed the story by OKT1. According to
OKT2, when OKT1 and OKT3 was about to leave for Taiping,
OKT2 has asked for a lift to Kuala Lumpur because he wanted to
visit his sister in Kuala Lumpur. OKT2 denied that he went to
Taiping with OKT1 and OKT3. OKT3 in his evidence affirmed
the story of OKT1 and OKT3. According to OKT3, he worked as
a lorry attendant with a furniture shop. When approached by
OKT2 who is his friend, he agreed to assist OKT2 in giving a
warning to the deceased. As a lorry attendant OKT3 has
travelled to many states and he might have been to the said
furniture shop in Taiping but he can’t remember when. All the
25



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

accused persons admitted that they went together to Taiping by
using a Naza Citra however none of them ever reached Taiping
on the said day and time. OKT2 was dropped off in Kuala
Lumpur whereas OK1 and OKT2 had made a U-turn when they
were informed by Ah Liang the deceased was robbed and killed.
[50] The accused persons were consistent in saying that the reason
why they all went to Taiping were to scare and to give a warning
to the deceased to better treat Xiao Mei and her mother and they
never had the intention to kill the deceased. OKT1 denied
meeting PW4 and further denied that he ever gave PW4 any LV
bag containing the identity card and licence belonging to the
deceased’s wife. He also denied suggesting to PW4 to run away
to Thailand and neither did he ever suggested to PW4 to dispose
of the said Naza Citra.
Submissions at The End of The Defence Case
[51] The learned counsel for OKT1 submitted that the prosecution is
relying on s. 34 PC because of the evidence by PW4, there is no
witness who can identify OKT1 at the scene. There was no
evidence which can place OKT1 at the scene of the crime and
the only avenue left is s. 34 PC. The learned counsel submitted
that PW4 is not a truthful witness because of his contradicting
evidence. The common intention of the accused persons was to
warn and not to murder and the learned counsel had put that to
PW4 who then agreed to that proposition during cross
examination at the prosecution stage. Therefore, it would be
misleading to say the defence had never put this proposition
across.
[52] The learned counsel further submitted that Ah Liang is not a
fictional character and in fact Ah Liang was mentioned by PW4
26



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

in his examination in chief at the prosecution stage. He
submitted further that from the facts adduced it could be
gathered that OKT1 had in fact made a U-turn and did not
proceeded to Taiping. Regarding the issue of alibi, no direct
evidence placing the OKT1 at the scene of the crime was offered
by the prosecution and it raises no burden on the defence to
prove otherwise. The learned counsel submitted that the defence
had successfully raised reasonable doubt in the prosecution case
and pray that OKT1 be acquitted and discharged.
[53] The counsel for OKT2 adopted the submission by the counsel
for OKT1 and further submitted that there is reasonable doubt
raised by OKT2. There was no direct evidence to show that
OKT2 committed this murder. The only evidence available is the
evidence of PW15 who saw OKT2 in the vicinity of the crime
scene on that day. However, the evidence of PW15 is suspect
since he was only able to identify 30% (as regards to his chin
and body) of OKT2. The learned counsel submitted that PW15
only saw from a distance and even then for a short period of
time only.
[54] It is submitted by the learned counsel that it is not reasonable
that PW15 can only identify 30% of OKT2 during ID Parade that
was held on 23 July 2012 but now after 3 1/2 years later, PW15
is able to identify OKT2 in the open court. The reason given by
PW15 that he was able to identify 30% for safety reason is not
acceptable. The counsel also argued that PW15 had never in his
evidence provided the time that he saw OKT2 at the crime scene
whereas in the charge it is very specific with time mentioned at
10.45 am. The learned counsel postulates that looking at the
evidence of PW15 in comparison to the evidence of OKT2, the
evidence of PW15 is not safe to be relied upon by this court.

27



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

[55] The evidence of OKT 2 is consistent with the evidence of OKT1
in that they were never at the crime scene. As regards to the
defence of alibi, the learned counsel adopted the submission by
the counsel for OKT1 and submitted that there is no evidence to
show to the satisfaction of this court that OKT2 was at the crime
scene on that particular date. He submitted that it is not about
the weakness of the defence case but the strength of the
prosecution case and in that respect the learned counsel
submitted that the defence had successfully raised reasonable
doubt in the prosecution case and pray that the OKT2 be
acquitted and discharged.
[56] The counsel for OKT3 adopted the submissions by the counsel
for OKT1 and OKT2 and submitted that the finger print report,
based on the evidence tendered by the prosecution merely goes
to show that the said finger print was found. However that
evidence alone is not sufficient to attach guilt as something
more is needed. The prosecution failed to prove whether OKT3
was in fact at the material time present at the crime scene during
the commission of the alleged murder. Alibi does not apply
since there is no independent evidence placing OKT3 at the
crime scene.
[57] The learned counsel also submitted that the defence has claimed
that the shoes with the blood stain belongs to OKT3’s brother
Mohd Jumaat. The prosecution failed to call Mohd Jumaat as a
rebuttal witness and neither did any statement was recorded
from the said Mohd Jumaat to show otherwise. The evidence
regarding the shoes belonging to Mohd Jumaat was never
challenged by the prosecution. No DNA evidence of OKT3 was
found on those shoes. In this regard it is not the duty of the
defence to call Mohd Jumaat. Therefore the counsel submitted
that the failure by the prosecution to call Mohd Jumaat as a
28



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

rebuttal witness warrants the court to invoke an adverse
inference under s. 114 (g) of EA against the prosecution
[58] The learned DPP submitted that the prosecution witnesses
given evidence that the accused persons were involved in
crime as charged. The PW4 had meetings, planning
preparation with the accused persons to kill the deceased
that cannot be disputed.

had
this
and
and

[59] The main issue is either to kill or just to warn the deceased.
PW4 is a reliable and credible witness and his evidence didn’t
falter during cross and during re-examination. The court can
access the evidence of PW4 who had a final meeting with the
accused persons at 2.00 am whereby the accused persons left
Johor Bahru for Taiping. The intention to kill can arise at any
time. The situation is similar even if the initial intention of the
accused persons were to merely warn the deceased but the end
result brought about the murder of the deceased.
[60] The pathologist confirmed that the deceased death was caused
by 4 stab wounds. PW15 saw OKT2 at the crime scene. OKT3
finger print was found at the crime scene. It was never denied
that OKT2 did use the said shoes and deceased blood was found
on one of those shoes. The learned DPP submitted further that
since defence proffered the defence of alibi then prior notice
ought to be given. He submitted that the defence has failed to
raise any doubt in the prosecution case and consequently the
prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. The
accused persons must be found guilty of the charge.
The Law
[61] Section 182A CPC set out the procedure and duty of a trial court
at the conclusion of the defence case that at the conclusion of
29



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

the trial, the Court shall consider all the evidence adduced
before it and shall decide whether the prosecution has proved its
case beyond reasonable doubt. If the Court finds that the
prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, the
Court shall find the accused guilty and he may be convicted on
it. If the Court finds that the prosecution has not proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt, the Court shall record an order of
acquittal.
[62] In Md Zainudin bin Raujan v. Public Prosecutor [2013] 4 CLJ
21, the Federal Court observed as follows:
“At the conclusion of the trial, s. 182A of the Criminal
Procedure Code imposes a duty on the trial court to
consider all the evidence adduced before it and to decide
whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt. The defence of the accused must be
considered in the totality of the evidence adduced by the
prosecution, as well as in the light of the well - established
principles enunciated in Mat v. Public Prosecutor [1963]
1 LNS 82; [1963] 1 MLJ 263 with regard to the approach
to be taken in evaluating the evidence of the defence.”
[63] Section 182A states that “all” the evidence must be considered
by the court. It is to be noted that emphasis has been laid on the
phrase “all”. In Prasit Punyang v. Public Prosecutor [2014] 7
CLJ 392; [2014] 4 MLJ 282, it was held as follows:
“In accordance with the provisions of s. 182A(1) of the
Criminal Procedure Code, it is the bounden duty of the
learned JC, at the conclusion of the trial, to consider all
the evidence adduced before him and shall decide whether
the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable

30



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

doubt. The legislature has advisedly used the term all the
evidence. The emphasis must be on the word all.”
[64] What amounts to a “reasonable doubt” itself is not defined in
section 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, there is
a plethora of case law as to its meaning. In Public Prosecutor v.
Saimin [1971] MLJ 16, it was held by Sharma J that:
“It is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating
to human affairs and depending upon moral evidence is
open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state
of the case which after the entire comparison and
consideration of all the evidence leaves the minds of the
jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an
abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the
charge.”
[65] In the case of Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji
Idris & Ors [1977] 1 MLJ 180, Abdoolcader J (as he then was)
explained the phrase reasonable doubt as follows:
“It is not necessary for the defence to prove anything and
all that is necessary for the accused to do is to give an
explanation that is reasonable and throws a reasonable
doubt on the case made out for the prosecution. It cannot
be a fanciful or whimsical or imaginary doubt, and in
considering the question as to whether a reasonable doubt
has been raised, the evidence adduced by and the case for
the defence must be viewed in at least some amount of
light, not necessarily bright sunlight, but certainly not
against the dark shadows of the night.”
[66] It can be summarised therefore that the phrase “reasonable
doubt” excludes fanciful or imaginary doubts or stories that are

31



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

so obviously conjured up so as not to be in accord with the
ordinary course of nature or human conduct when viewed and
appraised from the test of reasonableness. The foregoing of
course, are only guidelines and the court must apply these
according to all the circumstances of the case at hand.
[67] The approach in Mat v. Public Prosecutor was judicially
endorsed by the Federal Court as being the correct one to adopt
when evaluating the evidence of the defence case in Public
Prosecutor v. Mohd Radzi Bin Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ 457;
[2005] 6 MLJ 393, when it held:
“For the guidance of the courts below, we summarise as
follows the steps that should be taken by a trial court at
the close of the prosecution’s case:
(i)

the close of the prosecution’s case, subject
the evidence led by the prosecution in its
totality to a maximum evaluation. Carefully
scrutinise the credibility of each of the
prosecution’s witnesses. Take into account
all reasonable inferences that may be drawn
from that evidence. If the evidence admits of
two or more inferences, then draw the
inference that is most favourable to the
accused;

(ii)

ask yourself the question: If I now call upon
the accused to make his defence and he
elects to remain silent am I prepared to
convict him on the evidence now before me?
If the answer to that question is ‘Yes’, then a
prima facie case has been made out and the
defence should be called. If the answer is
32



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

‘No’ then, a prima facie case has not been
made out and the accused should be
acquitted;
(iii)

after the defence is called, the accused
elects to remain silent, then convict;

(iv) after defence is called, the accused elects to
give evidence, then go through the steps set out
in Mat v. Public Prosecutor [1963] 1 LNS 82;
[1963] MLJ 263.”
[68] Following from the above, if the court does not accept or believe
the defence raised by the accused it must not convict but must
proceed a stage further by considering whether the defence
evidence has raised in the mind of the court a reasonable doubt
as to the guilt of the accused. If it does, then the accused is
nevertheless entitled to an acquittal.
The Court’s Findings At The Defence Case
[69] After maximum evaluation of all the evidence available I find
that the evidence of OKT1-OKT3 are consistent is saying that
they were not at the said furniture shop when the murder took
place. It is obvious that the prosecution relied on circumstantial
evidence and the main witness PW4 who had narrated the story
of the preparation and execution for this murder that involved
all the accused persons. I have not over looked the fact that
during the cross examination of PW4, he said that there was no
pact (pakatan) to kill the deceased and instead the pact was to
warn and scare off the deceased and to better treat Xiao Mei and
her mother. I find that this fact was not re-examined at all by the
prosecution. I find that there is in fact a reasonable doubt as to

33



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

the pact to kill the deceased. I opined so because the evidence of
PW4 is consistent with the evidence of the accused persons that
the pact they have was to warn and scare the deceased only and
there was no intention to kill the deceased at all.
[70] I agree with the submission by the learned counsel for OKT1
that PW4 seems to have changed his evidence regarding this
pact when during examination in chief PW4 said there was a
pact by the accused persons to kill the deceased but he
nevertheless changed his evidence during cross when he agreed
to the suggestion by the counsels that there was never a pact to
kill the deceased. Obviously PW4 has given contradictory
evidence but he was never made a hostile witness nor has an
impeachment proceeding taken against PW4.
[71] I find that this fact made the evidence of PW4 that there was
never a pact by the accused persons to kill the deceased most
plausible. The learned counsel further submitted that the only
evidence that involves OKT1 is regarding the fact that he
wanted to warn and scare the deceased only. This unchallenged
evidence by PW4 had positively supported the fact that OKT1
had only intended to warn and scare the deceased. I find that a
person by the name of Ah Liang (who called OKT1 and OKT3
and made them make a U-turn and who also called PW4 to
inform him of the deceased’s death) raised by the defence during
the prosecution case was never rebutted by the prosecution and
consequently I would agree with the submission of the learned
counsels that the prosecution cannot now at the stage of the
defence propose or have this court believed that Ah Liang is a
fictional character
[72] I also agree with the submission by the learned counsel for
OKT1 and OKT2 that the prosecution had failed to cross

34



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

examined these two-accused persons regarding their evidence
that they had only intended to warn the deceased. The failure by
the prosecution to cross examine the said OKT1 and OKT2 on a
crucial part of the case will amount to a tacit acceptance of
OKT1 and OKT2 version of the story in that they had only
wanted to warn the deceased.
[73] Regarding alibi, the learned DPP contended that by claiming that
the accused persons were not at the crime scene during the murder
that would amount to a defence of alibi and hence notice ought to
be given to the prosecution. However, the learned counsels
submitted that their defence is not one of alibi because there was no
evidence to show that the accused persons were at the scene of the
crime when the murder took place. Therefore, no notice to the
prosecution is required. It was submitted by the learned counsels
that the defence is not under a supposed duty to prove otherwise
and therefore they do not have to give the notice of alibi. The
counsels submitted that the accused persons were consistent in their
evidence that they didn’t proceed to Taiping when they were
informed by Ah Liang that the deceased was robbed and killed. I
agree with the learned counsels that since there was no evidence to
place the accused persons at the scene of the crime when the
murder took place, it is not alibi as such and the requirement for
notice to the prosecution is not required.
[74] Regarding the evidence of PW15 who had identified OKT3 in
court as the Malay man he saw leaving the furniture shop. It
must be remembered that PW15 had only managed to identify
OKT3 for 30% only during the ID parade which was done on 23
July 2012 which was only days after the murder of the deceased.
Whereas after a lapse of 3 1/2 years PW15 came to court and
can identify the OKT3 as the Malay man whom he saw leaving
furniture shop on that said day. PW15 admitted that he might be
35



[2017] 1 LNS 46

Legal Network Series

mistaken and again this evidence was not re-examined by the
learned prosecutor. I believe the evidence of PW15 had been
successfully challenged by the defence and hence I find it is
unsafe to be relied upon. On a maximum evaluation of the main
witnesses of the prosecution whom failed to be consistent as
compared to the consistency of the evidence of the accused
persons. I find that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in
particular as regards to the evidence of PW4 and PW15 has been
successfully challenged by the defence and could no longer be
relied upon. I also find that the finger print of OKT3 at the
furniture shop is only evidence to show that OKT3 was at the
furniture shop but however I am of the opinion that it is not
enough evidence to show that OKT3 was at the furniture shop
during the commission of the crime.
[75] Based on the above maximum evaluation of the evidence of the
prosecution and the defence, I find that the defence has
succeeded in raising reasonable doubt in the prosecution case
and consequently therefore, the prosecution has failed to prove
their case beyond reasonable doubt. As is mandated by law, I
therefore acquit and discharge the accused persons from the said
charge.
