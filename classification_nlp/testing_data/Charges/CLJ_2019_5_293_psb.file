The appellant, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, was charged with seven
charges relating to offences committed under the Penal Code, the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (‘MACCA’) and the Anti-Money
Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities
Act 2001 (‘the seven charges’). The seven charges were registered under three
different suits on two different dates. The first four charges were filed on
4 July 2018 while the remaining three charges were filed on 8 August 2018.
On both dates, the charges were initially filed at the Sessions Court before

they were transferred to the High Court, pursuant to the certificates issued
by the Public Prosecutor (‘PP’) under s. 418A of the Criminal Procedure
Code (‘CPC’) and s. 60 of the MACCA. At the High Court, the Attorney
General (‘AG’) filed an application to withdraw the above-mentioned
transfer certificates. Allowing the application, the High Court Judge (‘HCJ’)
held that (i) the AG, as the PP, was empowered to effect the withdrawal of
the transfer certificates issued under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the
MACCA in respect of the seven charges; (ii) the withdrawal of the transfer
certificates would not cause ramifications and an unhealthy precedent in the
administration of the courts; (iii) with the withdrawal, the seven charges were
reverted to the Sessions Court where they were originally registered; and (iv)
the process of the registration via the routing system was applicable for
transfer applications made by the prosecution or the accused under s. 417(2)
of the CPC but such formality was unnecessary when the High Court
exercises its discretion to act on its own initiative under s. 417(2) of the CPC,
provided the requirements of s. 417 is adhered to, particularly the ground for
transfer under s. 417(1)(a) to (e) of the CPC. The HCJ exercised his discretion
under s. 417(2) of the CPC, on its own motion, to invoke s. 417(1) of the
CPC to order the transfer of the seven charges, registered under the three
suits, from the Sessions Court to the High Court in accordance with s.
417(1)(cc) read with s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC. The seven charges were
transferred back to the same High Court and to continue from the point of
the withdrawal (7 February 2019) with the proceedings prior to the
withdrawal remaining valid. Hence, the present appeal. In support of his
appeal, the appellant raised the questions of (i) whether there was a breach
of natural justice, namely the audi alteram partem rule, as (a) the HCJ did not
grant the short adjournment sought for full research and argument; and
(b) the HCJ provided improved and fresh grounds of decision dated
15 February 2019 (‘the impugned second judgment’) not raised and argued
on 7 February 2019; (ii) whether the PP’s power to withdraw a s. 418A
certificate was spent when the said certificate was acted on and whether the
PP was functus officio; (iii) whether the HCJ’s reasoning on the powers of the
PP was flawed; (iv) whether the PP could attempt to regularise where
jurisdiction to issue transfer certificates was doubted; (v) whether the HCJ
acted on ‘own initiative’ under s. 417(2) of the CPC; and (vi) whether the
HCJ could transfer the case back to himself.
Held (dismissing appeal; affirming decision of High Court)
Per Lau Bee Lan JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) There were adequate reasons for the HCJ’s refusal of the adjournment
as the reasons laid in the very considerations under s. 417(1)(e) of the
CPC. When the HCJ made the order on its own initiative, under
s. 417(2) of the CPC, it was an exercise of discretion to transfer the three
cases from the Sessions Court to the High Court, pursuant to
s. 417(1)(cc) of the CPC, which entailed a consideration whether such
an order is expedient for the ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e). (para 33)

(2) The HCJ merely gave a brief decision orally on 7 February 2019 after
hearing the parties. His Lordship did not give any signed written
judgment on 7 February 2019; what the HCJ signed as ‘Salinan Diakui
Sah’ was the notes of proceedings of 7 February 2019 and the signature
below the said decision was part of the practice of a judicial officer
signing or placing his initials on the notes of proceedings to show an
event has occurred in the proceedings. This could be seen throughout the
notes of proceedings. The second impugned judgment dated 15 February
2019 ought not to be expunged or disregarded and not form part of the
record. (para 41)
(3) The concept of functus officio applies to a court of law and not acts of
the PP under the Federal Constitution (‘FC’). The doctrine of functus
officio is part of the doctrine of res judicata. A party could not ask the
court to re-visit the same dispute. The appellant’s submission that the
PP could not be said to have the power to withdraw a s. 418A certificate
as the power was spent when the said certificate was acted on and the
PP was functus officio bore no merit. (para 52)
(4) The relevant provisions in respect of the PP’s power to transfer is
provided in arts. 145(3) and (3A) of the FC. Statutorily, the relevant
provisions in respect of the PP’s power to transfer is provided in ss. 417,
418 and 418A of the CPC. In interpreting the constitutional and
statutory provisions, the court is required to adopt the purposive
approach under s. 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967. The
purpose or object of s. 417(1) of the CPC is to ensure that a transfer order
is made by the High Court when an application is made by any of the
parties entitled to apply under s. 417(2) of the CPC on the basis of the
transfer under s. 417(1)(a) to (e) of the CPC and the types of order that
may be made under s. 417(1)(aa) to (cc) of the CPC. In issuing the
transfer certificates, under s. 418A of the CPC, the AG was acting under
arts. 145(3) and (3A) of the FC. (paras 43-47)

G

(5) The HCJ’s reasoning on the powers of the PP was not flawed as
His Lordship substantiated his findings that the PP was empowered to
effect withdrawal of the transfer certificates. The HCJ’s findings were
supported by applicable laws or principles gleaned from case laws.
(para 53)

H

(6) There was no jurisdictional challenge as to the right of the PP to issue
the transfer certificates under s. 418A of the CPC. This was the finding
of the HCJ and it was legally correct. The issuance of the transfer
certificates was protected by the presumption of constitutionality. All
the PP did was to act in abundance of caution by withdrawing the
certificates. (para 54)

I

(7) The AG was merely highlighting to the HCJ the options and left it
entirely for His Lordship to decide under s. 417(2) of the CPC. ‘On its
own initiative’, among others, means ‘to initiate is therefore to cause a

[2019] 5 CLJ

process or action to begin’. This was what the HCJ did: acting on the
own initiative of the High Court in the exercise of his discretion under
s. 417(2) of the CPC, His Lordship decided that the seven charges should
continue to be tried by the High Court on the basis that it would be
expedient for the ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e) after taking into
account several considerations. There was no reason to disturb the
HCJ’s approach on the exercise of discretion when determining an
application for transfer, under s. 417 CPC, by drawing a distinction
between an application emanating from the PP and that from an accused
person, as opposed to the court acting on its own initiative. (paras 56
& 59)
(8) The HCJ was not transferring the cases to himself but rather to the High
Court of which His Lordship was the presiding judge in the exercise of
its power under s. 417(2) of the CPC (acting on the own initiative of the
High Court) on the basis of the transfer under s. 417(1)(e) to order the
three cases pending in the Sessions Court to be transferred to and tried
before the High Court under s. 417(1)(cc) of the CPC. Hence, the issue
of usurpation of the powers of the Chief Judge of Malaya did not arise.

Perayu, bekas Perdana Menteri Malaysia, dituduh dengan tujuh pertuduhan
berkaitan pelakuan kesalahan-kesalahan bawah Kanun Keseksaan, Akta
Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia 2009 (‘ASPRM’) dan Akta
Pengubahan Wang Haram, Pencegahan Pembiayaan Keganasan dan Hasil
Daripada Aktiviti Haram 2001 (‘tujuh pertuduhan’). Tujuh pertuduhan ini
didaftarkan bawah tiga guaman berbeza pada tarikh berbeza. Empat
pertuduhan pertama difailkan pada 4 Julai 2018 manakala tiga lagi difailkan
pada 8 Ogos 2018. Pada kedua-dua tarikh, pertuduhan-pertuduhan tersebut
asalnya difailkan di Mahkamah Sesyen sebelum kesemuanya dipindahkan ke
Mahkamah Tinggi, menurut akuan-akuan yang dikeluarkan oleh Pendakwa
Raya (‘PR’) bawah s. 418A Kanun Tatacara Jenayah (‘KTJ’) dan s. 60
ASPRM. Di Mahkamah Tinggi, Peguam Negara (‘AG’) memfailkan
permohonan menarik semula akuan-akuan pindah yang dinyatakan di atas.
Membenarkan permohonan tersebut, Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi (‘HMT’)
memutuskan (i) AG, sebagai PR, berkuasa menarik semula akuan-akuan
pindah yang dikeluarkan bawah s. 418A KTJ dan s. 60 ASPRM untuk tujuh
pertuduhan tersebut; (ii) penarikan semula akuan-akuan pindah tidak akan
mengakibatkan kesan rumit dan duluan tidak normal dalam pentadbiran
mahkamah; (iii) dengan penarikan semula, tujuh pertuduhan tersebut
dikembalikan ke Mahkamah Sesyen iaitu tempat asal semuanya didaftarkan;
dan (iv) proses pendaftaran melalui sistem penghalaan terpakai dalam
permohonan-permohonan pindahan yang dibuat oleh pihak pendakwaan atau
tertuduh bawah s. 417(2) KTJ tetapi formaliti sedemikian tidak perlu apabila

sendiri bawah s. 417(2) KTJ, asalkan kehendak-kehendak s. 417 dipatuhi,
khususnya alasan pindahan bawah s. 417(1)(a) hingga (e) KTJ. Hakim
Mahkamah Tinggi menjalankan budi bicara beliau bawah s. 417(2) KTJ, atas
usulnya, untuk membangkitkan s. 417(1) KTJ, memerintahkan pindahan
tujuh pertuduhan tersebut, yang berdaftar bawah tiga guaman, dari
Mahkamah Sesyen ke Mahkamah Tinggi, selaras dengan s. 417(1)(cc) dibaca
bersekali dengan s. 417(1)(e) KTJ. Tujuh pertuduhan tersebut dipindahkan
semula ke Mahkamah Tinggi dan bersambung dari penarikan semula
(7 Februari 2019) dan prosiding sebelum penarikan semula kekal sah. Maka
timbul rayuan ini. Menyokong rayuan beliau, perayu membangkitkan
soalan-soalan (i) sama ada berlaku pencabulan keadilan asasi, khususnya
peraturan audi alteram partem kerana (a) HMT tidak membenarkan
penangguhan singkat untuk penyelidikan dan hujahan penuh; dan (b) HMT
memberi alasan penghakiman yang dibaiki dan baharu bertarikh 15 Februari
2019 (‘penghakiman kedua yang dipersoal’) yang tidak dibangkitkan dan
dihujahkan pada 7 Februari 2019; (ii) sama ada kuasa PR menarik semula
akuan s. 418A diguna apabila akuan tersebut dikemukakan dan sama ada PR
telah functus officio; (iii) sama ada alasan HMT tentang kuasa-kuasa PR cacat;
(iv) sama ada PR boleh cuba melazimkan jika bidang kuasa mengeluarkan
akuan-akuan pindah diragui; (v) sama ada HMT bertindak atas inisiatif beliau
sendiri bawah s. 417(2) KTJ; dan (vi) sama ada HMT boleh memindahkan
kes tersebut kepada diri beliau.
Diputuskan (menolak rayuan; mengesahkan keputusan Mahkamah
Tinggi)
Oleh Lau Bee Lan HMR menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah:

F

G

H

I

(1) Terdapat alasan-alasan mencukupi untuk HMT menolak penangguhan
kerana alasan-alasan ini terletak dalam pertimbangan-pertimbangan
bawah s. 417(1)(e) KTJ sendiri. Apabila HMT membuat perintah atas
inisiatif sendiri bawah s. 417(2) KTJ, ini adalah penjalanan budi bicara
untuk memindah tiga kes tersebut dari Mahkamah Sesyen ke Mahkamah
Tinggi, bawah s. 417(1)(cc) KTJ, yang melibatkan pertimbangan sama
ada perintah sedemikian wajar demi mencapai keadilan bawah
s. 417(1)(e).
(2) Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi sekadar memberi keputusan ringkas secara
lisan pada 7 Februari 2019 selepas mendengar pihak-pihak. Beliau tidak
memberi apa-apa penghakiman bertulis yang bertandatangan pada
7 Februari 2019; yang ditandatangani oleh HMT sebagai ‘Salinan
Diakui Sah’ ialah nota prosiding pada 7 Februari 2019 dan tandatangan
di bawah keputusan tersebut ialah sebahagian amalan pegawai
kehakiman yang menurunkan tandatangan atau meletakkan inisial pada
nota prosiding tersebut untuk menunjukkan sesuatu berlaku dalam
prosiding. Ini boleh dilihat dalam seluruh nota prosiding. Penghakiman
kedua yang dipersoalkan, bertarikh 15 Februari 2019, tidak sepatutnya
dipadamkan atau diabaikan mahupun tidak membentuk sebahagian
rekod.

[2019] 5 CLJ

(3) Konsep functus officio terpakai pada mahkamah perundangan dan bukan
tindakan-tindakan PR bawah Perlembagaan Persekutuan (‘PP’). Doktrin
functus officio sebahagian doktrin res judicata. Satu pihak tidak boleh
memohon mahkamah melihat semula pertikaian yang sama. Hujahan
perayu bahawa PR tidak boleh dikatakan mempunyai kuasa untuk
menarik balik akuan s. 418A kerana kuasa tersebut diguna semasa akuan
tersebut dikemukakan dan PR telah functus officio tidak bermerit.
(4) Peruntukan-peruntukan relevan berkaitan kuasa PR untuk memindah
diperuntukkan dalam per. 145(3) dan (3A) PP. Bawah statut,
peruntukan-peruntukan relevan berkaitan kuasa PR untuk memindah
diperuntukkan bawah s. 417, 418 dan 418A KTJ. Dalam mentafsir
peruntukan perlembagaan dan statutori, mahkamah perlu mengguna
pakai pendekatan tujuan bawah s. 17A Akta Tafsiran 1948 dan 1967.
Matlamat atau objektif s. 417(1) KTJ ialah memastikan satu perintah
pindahan dibuat oleh Mahkamah Tinggi apabila satu permohonan dibuat
oleh mana-mana pihak yang berhak memohon bawah s. 417(2) KTJ atas
dasar pindahan tersebut bawah s. 417(1)(a) hingga (e) KTJ dan jenis-jenis
perintah yang boleh dibuat bawah s. 417(1)(aa) hingga (cc) KTJ. Dalam
mengeluarkan akuan-akuan pindah, bawah s. 418A KTJ, AG bertindak
bawah per. 145(3) dan (3A) PP.

A

B

C

D

(5) Alasan-alasan HMT berkaitan kuasa-kuasa PR tidak cacat kerana beliau
menyokong dapatan-dapatan beliau bahawa PR mempunyai kuasa
menarik semula akuan-akuan pindah. Dapatan-dapatan HMT disokong
dengan undang-undang terpakai atau prinsip-prinsip yang boleh dikutip
daripada kes-kes undang-undang.

E

(6) Tiada cabaran terhadap bidang kuasa berkaitan hak PR mengeluarkan
akuan-akuan pindah bawah s. 418A KTJ. Ini dapatan HMT dan dapatan
tersebut betul bawah undang-undang. Pengeluaran akuan-akuan pindah
dilindungi oleh anggapan berperlembagaan. Pendakwa Raya hanya
bertindak berdasarkan limpahan amaran dengan menarik semula
akuan-akuan.

F

(7) Peguam Negara sekadar menekankan, pada HMT, pilihan-pilihan sedia
ada dan menyerahkan semuanya agar diputuskan oleh HMT bawah
s. 417(2) KTJ. ‘Atas inisiatifnya’, antara lain, bermaksud ‘untuk
memulakan iaitu menyebabkan satu proses atau tindakan bermula’. Ini
yang dilakukan oleh HMT: bertindak atas insiatif Mahkamah Tinggi
dalam menjalankan budi bicara beliau bawah s. 417(2) KTJ, HMT
memutuskan tujuh pertuduhan tersebut akan disambung-bicara oleh
Mahkamah Tinggi atas dasar ini wajar untuk mencapai keadilan bawah
s. 417(1)(e) selepas mengambil kira beberapa pertimbangan. Tiada
alasan untuk campur tangan dalam pendekatan HMT tentang penjalanan

budi bicara apabila memutuskan satu permohonan pindah, bawah s. 417
KTJ, dengan membuat perbezaan antara permohonan yang timbul
daripada PR dan daripada tertuduh, berbanding mahkamah yang
bertindak atas inisiatifnya sendiri.
(8) Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi tidak memindahkan kes-kes tersebut kepada
diri beliau tetapi ke Mahkamah Tinggi yang beliau sidangi sebagai
hakim dalam menjalankan kuasanya bawah s. 417(2) KTJ (bertindak
atas inisiatif Mahkamah Tinggi sendiri) atas dasar pindah bawah
s. 417(1)(e) untuk memerintahkan ketiga-tiga kes sementara menanti
Mahkamah Sesyen agar dipindah dan dibicarakan di Mahkamah Tinggi
bawah s. 417(1)(cc) KTJ. Oleh itu, isu rampasan kuasa Hakim Besar
Malaya tidak timbul.

Salient Background Facts
[1]
This appeal by the appellant stems from an oral application by the
learned Attorney General (‘AG’) as the Public Prosecutor (‘PP’) to
withdraw the certificates issued under s. 418A of the Criminal Procedure
Code (‘the CPC’) and s. 60 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission
Act 2009 (‘the MACC Act’) that were previously issued by the PP to transfer
to the High Court the charges against the appellant that had been first filed
in the Sessions Court. The learned High Court Judge (‘the HCJ’) allowed the
oral application by the AG and exercised his discretion under s. 417(2) of
the CPC to order the transfer of the charges back to the High Court.
[2]
The appellant was charged with seven criminal charges for offences
under the Penal Code, the MACC Act, and the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001
(‘the AMLAFTA’) which have been registered under three different case nos.
ie, WA-45-2-07-2018, WA-45-3-07-2018 and WA-45-5-08-2018.
[3]
The seven charges were registered on two different dates: four charges
for offences under Penal Code and MACC Act were filed on 4 July 2018 and
the remainder three charges under AMLATFA were filed on 8 August 2018.
All the seven charges were ordered to be jointly tried. The appellant pleaded
not guilty to all the charges. The High Court fixed trial of the seven charges
from 12 February 2019 to 29 March 2019.

On both dates of 4 July 2018 and 8 August 2018, the charges were

certificates issued by the PP under s. 418A of CPC and s. 60 of the MACC
Act.

[5]
On 28 January 2019, another three new additional charges under
AMLATFA were read out to the appellant. The prosecution asked for the
three new charges to be jointly tried with the existing seven. Counsel for the
appellant asked the court to allow the defence a few days to consider. The
court allowed the request and fixed 7 February 2019 for hearing of the
submission of parties should there be any objection to the proposed joint
trial.

D

F

G

[6]
On 7 February 2019, the learned AG informed the court that a ruling
on the issue of joinder would not be necessary as he was proposing not to
proceed on the three new charges and asked for the appellant to be granted
a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (‘DNAA’) since the prosecution
would file these charges before the Sessions Court instead. The appellant did
not object. The High Court then ordered the DNAA of the appellant on the
three new charges.
[7]
The learned AG raised another matter which became contentious. The
AG wished to withdraw the transfer certificates that had been previously
issued under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act to transfer the
seven charges to the High Court.
[8]
The withdrawal was stated by the learned AG to be done out of
abundance of caution in order to avoid any possible constitutional argument
that the transfer effected by the AG under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of
the MACC is a nullity in view of the Federal Court decisions in Semenyih
Jaya Sdn Bhd v. Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Hulu Langat & Another Case
[2017] 5 CLJ 526 and Indira Gandhi Mutho v. Pengarah Jabatan Agama Islam
Perak & Ors And Other Appeals [2018] 3 CLJ 145.
[9]
The learned AG informed the court that upon withdrawal, the cases
on the seven charges would revert to the Sessions Court where they
originated. He then drew to the court’s attention there were two options:

H

I

(i) the prosecution can have the charges mentioned at the Sessions Court
and then immediately apply under s. 417 to have them transferred back
to this High Court; or
(ii) alternatively, the learned AG suggested that the High Court can act suo
moto (on its own initiative) under s. 417(2) and it is expedient for the
ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC to order the transfer of the
seven charges from the Sessions Court back to this High Court.



302

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[10] The learned AG highlighted that these procedural steps would be
necessary to prevent any unwarranted postponement of the trial especially
since that there has been compliance with s. 51A of the CPC, 26 witness
statements had been supplied to the defence, and subpoenas had all been
served on the witnesses in preparation for trial which was to commence on
12 February 2019.

A

B

[11] At the hearing, the defence submitted the withdrawal means that the
proceedings ceased to exist and there was nothing for this High Court to order
to transfer. If the validity of s. 418A and s. 60 is doubtful, so would the act
of withdrawing the certificates.
[12] Further, it was contended even the status of the proceedings, including
the concluded hearings on the applications for the gag order, the appointment
letter of the prosecutor and the request for discovery of documents and the
entire proceedings since the transfer to the High Court all of which proceeded
in the High Court on the basis of the previous certificates, could now be at
risk of being vitiated.
[13] The learned lead counsel pointed out that once withdrawn, the whole
process of a mention at the Sessions Court and a fresh registration at the High
Court Registry to determine the High Court to try the seven charges must be
followed. The defence would reserve the right to object should the seven
charges eventually be registered in the same High Court since these should
be considered as a new case that would warrant a High Court Judge who
would not have adjudicated on the matter previously.

C

D

E

Findings Of The High Court
[14] Summarily, the findings of the learned HCJ based on the decision
made on 7 February 2019 and judgment dated 15 February 2019
(the admissibility of the latter will be addressed later) are:
(i) The AG as the PP is empowered to effect the withdrawal of the transfer
certificates issued under s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act
in respect of the seven charges.

F

G

(ii) The withdrawal of the transfer certificates would not cause ramifications
implied by the lead counsel for the appellant to be serious and setting
an unhealthy precedent in the administration of the courts.
(iii) With the withdrawal of the transfer certificates in respect of the seven
charges, the seven charges are reverted to the Sessions Court where they
had been originally registered.
(iv) The process of the registration via the routing system is applicable for
transfer applications made by the prosecution or the accused under
s. 417(2). However it is unnecessary for such a formality when the
High Court exercises its discretion to act on its own initiative under
s. 417(2) provided the requirements of s. 417 is adhered, particularly the
ground for the transfer under s. 417(1)(a) to (e).

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak

(v) The learned HCJ exercised his discretion under s. 417(2) of the CPC
(on its own motion) to invoke s. 417(1) of the CPC to order the transfer
of the seven charges registered under the three cases from the Sessions
Court to the High Court in accordance with s. 417(1)(cc) read with
s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC. In so doing, the learned HCJ gave due regard
to information made known to the court by the learned AG ie, the mode
by which by the three cases comprising the original seven charges were
transferred to the High Court under certificates issued by the AG
pursuant to the power conferred on the PP under s. 145(3A), s. 418A
of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act; that the defence did not object
to this mode of transfer and that this mode of transfer has been regularly
used since amendments were made to the Constitution in 1988 and the
matters referred in paras [8,] [9] and [10] above.
(vi) The basis of the considerations under s. 417(1)(e) of the CPC that it
would be expedient for the ends of justice held by the learned HCJ are:

D

E

F

First, the 7 charges were registered on 4th of July and since then
this High Court has heard 3 contested applications in the course
of following months all of which are pending appeal. Secondly,
charges in other prosecution against the accused have also been
transferred to this High Court under the same Section 417(1)(e) on
the application of the accused himself. Thirdly, this case has also
generated much public interest locally as well as internationally.
Fourthly, there is no real prejudice or injustice caused to the
defence of the accused. In essence and substance, there are no
changes to this proceeding other than merely on the basis of the
transfer of the case. Therefore the prosecution has in fact complied
with Section 51A on delivery of documents. All applications have
been heard and a date of a trial to start 3rd of February was fixed
almost 6 months ago. Fifthly, even the original form 418A
certificate was not objected to by the accused.
(emphasis added)

G

(vii) The seven charges are transferred back to the same High Court and to
continue from the point of the withdrawal (7 February 2019) with the
proceedings prior to the withdrawal remaining valid.
Our Findings

H

[15] We had considered the written submissions, reply submissions cum
oral submissions of the lead counsel and co-counsel for the appellant and the
learned AG for the respondent, all of which have been ably argued.
[16] At the forefront of our minds are the following applicable legal
principles:

I

(i) The appellate court will not interfere with the trial judge’s decision and
may not set it aside on appeal unless it is shown it is “plainly wrong”
in that the trial court had arrived at its decision or finding (i) incorrectly



Current Law Journal

304

[2019] 5 CLJ

on the basis of the relevant law and/or the established evidence and
(ii) without judicial appreciation of the evidence (see Gan Yook Chin &
Anor v. Lee Ing Chin & Ors [2004] 4 CLJ 309 (FC) at p. 321 h-i).
(ii) An appeal is a continuation of proceedings by way of rehearing and an
appeal court is empowered to review or to re-evaluate all the evidence
available to arrive at its decision (see Agudosi Ikenna Emmanuel
v. PP [2015] 1 LNS 1062; [2016] 2 MLJ 596 (CA) at 607 [27] and
PP v. Azilah Hadri & Anor [2015] 1 CLJ 579 at 612; [2015] 1 MLJ 617
(FC) at 650 [102] which was referred to in the former case).
Breach Of Natural Justice

A

B

C

[17] The thrust of the appellant’s complaint under this head of argument is
two-fold:
(i) the learned HCJ did not grant the short adjournment sought for full
research and argument; and
D

(ii) the learned HCJ provided improved and gave fresh grounds of decision
dated 15 February 2019 (‘impugned second judgment’) not raised and
argued on 7 February 2019. In this regard, we state at the outset our
views on the impugned second judgment is subject to the rider of our
ruling on the expungement of the same to be discussed later.
[18] Hence the appellant contends there is a breach of the natural justice,
namely the audi alteram partem rule. The appellant urges the court to allow
the appeal and seeks for an order that the learned HCJ’s judgment be set aside
and remitted to the High Court for hearing before a different judge pursuant
to s. 60(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (‘CJA’) or an order that the
proceedings at the High Court have been vitiated and the appellant be granted
a DNAA on the seven charges with liberty to the PP to re-charge the
appellant in the Sessions Court.

E

F

Request For Adjournment
[19] On the issue of the request for adjournment by the appellant, we are
guided by the instructive general principles governing the principles in the
exercise of discretion of a judge to allow or refuse adjournment propounded
in Dick v. Piller [1943] All ER 627 which were approved and adopted by the
Federal Court in Lee Ah Tee v. Ong Tiow Pheng & Ors [1984] 1 CLJ 26; [1984]
1 CLJ (Rep) 187 at p. 189(e) to (h) as discussed below.
[20]

G

H

Firstly, we start on two premises namely:

(1) Whether or not a party should be granted an adjournment is wholly
at the discretion of the Judge. He would exercise the discretion solely
upon his view of the facts.
(2) Prima facie this discretion is unfettered.

I



[2019] 5 CLJ
A

[21]

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

305

Secondly, we asked ourselves the following:

(3) [W]hether on the facts [of the instant case] there are adequate or
sufficient reasons [for the learned HCJ] to refuse the adjournment.

B

[22] Thirdly, we remind ourselves that an appellate court refrains from
interfering with the learned HCJ‘s exercise of discretion in regard to the
granting of an adjournment:
4. [U]nless it appears that such discretion has been exercised in a way
which tended to show that all necessary matters were not taken into
consideration or the decision was otherwise arbitrarily made.; and

C

[23]

Fourthly, the appellate court is slow to interfere:

5. [B]ut if it appears that the result of the order made below would be
to defeat the rights of the parties altogether or that there would be an
injustice to one or the other of the parties then the appellate Court has
power and indeed a duty to review the exercise of the discretion.
D

E

[24] We have perused the notes of proceeding held on 7 February 2019
before the learned HCJ (pp. 1-19 nota keterangan jld 2). These are our
observations:
(i) In response to the matters raised by the learned AG on 7 February 2019
(see paras 6 to 10 above), whilst the learned lead counsel stated twice
he was taken by surprise, he said he required at least ½ an hour
adjournment (stated twice) to confer with the appellant and team in
relation to especially whether the s. 418A certificate can be withdrawn
ending the third time with “Maybe Yang Arif would be so kind to
permit us to have it.” (pp. 4-5 nota keterangan jld 2).

F

(ii) The learned HCJ granted the request (p. 5 nota keterangan jld 2).

G

(iii) Whilst the respondent requested for more time (till Monday or Tuesday)
to do research so that any decision that is made is made after careful
consideration of mature arguments (pp. 7, 9, 10 & 12 nota keterangan
jld 2), the submissions of the lead counsel and the co-counsel proceeded
at length (pp. 5-13 nota keterangan jld 2).
(iv) After the respondent’s reply, the appellant’s counsel submitted at length
(pp. 15-18 nota keterangan jld 2).

H

I

(v) Before the decision of the court, the learned lead counsel said “I don’t
think I need to add any more unless has got questions” (sic) but
acknowledging that the respondent and AG have submitted and ending
with “[I]t is pregnant with authorities that is crying out to be researched
… and that’s what we ask” (p. 18 nota keterangan jld 2).
(vi) By conduct, namely by allowing the appellant’s counsel’s request for ½
an hour adjournment followed by the continuing act of allowing the
parties to submit, the learned HCJ has impliedly refused the appellant’s



Current Law Journal

306

[2019] 5 CLJ

request for adjournment. In this regard in our considered opinion, the
appellant’s contention that the bullet points on “serious issues” and
“evidence that counsel were not making submissions to seek
determination of the substantive matters but were instead providing
basis to justify their request for a short adjournment.” (at para (c) iv
pp. 28-29 of the appellant’s written submission) is negated.

A

B

(a) It is clear the learned HCJ delivered his decision only after hearing
the submissions of the parties. This is evident from para. [17] of the
impugned second judgment:
The matter on the withdrawal of the transfer certificates, as
I mentioned earlier, was raised by the prosecution only on
7 February 2019 itself, without prior notice. The prosecution
and the defence submitted orally on the points of
contention as I have outlined earlier. There were no written
submissions. The lead counsel for the defence did suggest
that the Court allow more time for parties to research on
the matter and to submit on another day. After having
considered oral arguments, I chose to decide on the matter,
for the reasons that will now follow.

C

D

(emphasis added)

[25] The appellant in submission stated (i) “the sealed orders dated
7 February 2019 also does not carry any decision on the adjournment.” and
(ii) the learned HCJ “in the second judgment suddenly viewed the matter as
an application by the PP to withdraw the transfer certificates (para [1],
second judgment @ p. 24 RRJ1), when in fact this was not the case. This was
not the pronouncement made on 7 February 2019 nor was it part of the
sealed orders.”

E

F

[26] We find there is no merit in the appellant’s submissions (i) and
(ii) above for these reasons:
(i) Having examined the sealed orders dated 7 February 2019 in respect of
the three cases which are similar save for the intitulement, we observe
that para (c) of the orders states:
(c) Permohonan untuk penangguhan perbicaraan dan
penggantungan prosiding bagi kes no. WA-45-2-07/218, WA-45-307/218 dan WA-45-5-08/218 adalah ditolak.

G

H

(emphasis added).

Hence this negates the appellant’s submission (i) above.
(ii) The learned HCJ on 7 February 2019 states “My decision on the
application made by the Public Prosecutor. The Public Prosecutor has
the power to discontinue or decline to further prosecute at any stage
of the trial.” (emphasis added). This is followed by the order for DNAA

I



[2019] 5 CLJ

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

307

A

for the three additional charges. The learned HCJ then states “In respect
of the existing seven charges, in my view the Public Prosecutor is
similarly empowered to effect the withdrawal of s. 418A certificate …”.
It is essential to note the opening statement of the learned HCJ which
I have emboldened and underlined.

B

(a) Then in the impugned second judgment (the admissibility of which
is addressed below), the learned HCJ in his introductory remarks
said:

C

D

This is an oral application by the Attorney General to
withdraw the certificates issued under Section 418A of the
Criminal Procedure Code (“the CPC”) and Section 60 of the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act 2009 (“the MACC Act”) that
were previously issued by the Public Prosecutor to transfer to
the High Court the charges against the accused that had
been first filed in the Sessions Court.
(emphasis added)

(1) Then in the sealed orders, among others, state:

E

DAN SETELAH MENDENGAR DAN MENELITI
keterangan dan hujahan 5 kedua-dua pihak di atas
MAKA ADALAH DIPERINTAHKAN seperti berikut:

menurut Seksyen 417(2) dan Seksyen 417(1)(e) Kanun Prosedur

(emphasis added)

(i) All the above has to be viewed against the backdrop of the
learned HCJ’s observation in the impugned second judgment
that the issue of the AG’s withdrawal of the transfer
certificates “became contentious” which is substantiated by
the notes of evidence of the proceedings on 7 February 2019.
[27] Taking all the matters stated above holistically (para 26(ii) to (i)), we
are of the view there is no inconsistency between what the learned HCJ said
in the impugned second judgment vis a vis his pronouncement made on
7 February 2019 and the sealed orders.



308

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

[28] We are satisfied that the learned HCJ was fully conscious of the
circumstances of the three cases before him namely, trial dates were fixed in
February and March 2019 and s. 51A of the CPC documents were served
(23 volumes on 14 November 2018, two volumes on 1 February 2018 and
six volumes on 8 March 2019). There is no basis for the appellant’s
complaint that he received the last set of documents only on 8 March 2019
as the respondent in para. 3 of the letter of even date to the lead counsel’s
firm notified “the documents served as part of the evidence for the
prosecution is not final and the prosecution reserves the right to serve further
documents before the commencement of the trial or adduce further
documents during trial.”
[29] The appellant has cited Ting Sieh Chung v. Hock Peng Realty Sdn Bhd
[2016] 7 CLJ 527; [2016] 5 MLJ 342], Sunil Kumar Gnosh v. Ajit Kumar Das
& Ors AIR 1969 CAL 492 (Calcutta High Court) and R v. Thames Magistrates’
Court, ex parte Polemis [1974] 2 All ER 1220 for the proposition that a breach
of natural justice occurs when insufficient time is given to counsel or an
adjournment application unjustifiably refused/not considered. The
authorities of Sunil Kumar Gnosh (supra) and R v. Thames (supra) are applicable
to the fact pattern of the cases therein. In the former case, the case has a
chequered history of many adjournments with judgment deferred until finally
about a year later, the judgment of the Magistrate who delivered the decision
by acquitting the accused persons of the respective charges was impugned on
the sole ground that he had not given the parties an opportunity to advance
arguments before the delivery of the judgment, The court considered the
issue in the light of natural justice.
[30] Whilst R v. Thames concerns a motion for an order for certiorari to
quash an order of the Thames Magistrates’ Court which adjudged the
applicant guilty of an offence under s. 2(1) of the Prevention of Oil Pollution
Act 1971 which the court said was not trivial. The court granted the certiorari
because the applicant was not given reasonable opportunity to present his
case as he had no time (i) to take samples, (ii) to see a report of the samples
taken by the prosecution, (iii) to look for witnesses, (iv) to prepare supporting
evidence of his case and (v) he was a foreigner with rudimentary knowledge
of the English language.
[31] The pertinent case is Ting Sieh Chung v. Hock Peng Realty Sdn Bhd
[2016] 7 CLJ 527 (a case common to both parties) where it is crystal clear
the Court of Appeal found there was a breach of the audi alteram partem rule
when the Deputy Registrar refused the defendant’s request for a short
adjournment for the work permit to be issued to an accountant whom the
defendant wished to call to rebut the expert evidence on accounts from the
plaintiff’s expert witness.
[32] However unlike the three cases above, the facts of the case in this
appeal before us are different. We find the evidence showed that having
heard the parties’ submission coupled with the matters alluded in para 24(i)

[2019] 5 CLJ

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

309

A

to (a) above, the learned HCJ has judiciously exercised his discretion not to
allow the adjournment sought by the appellant albeit not expressly stated. We
find on the facts of this appeal the rule of audi alteram partem has been
adhered. This is in accordance with the ratio in Ting Sieh Chung (supra) at
533 [12] where this court held:

B

[12] It is trite that adjournment is a matter of discretion of the learned
DR but that discretion must be exercised judiciously. We recognised that
not all applications for an adjournment must be granted as a matter of
course. An unwarranted application for an adjournment may indeed be
an attempt to unjustly delay the course of justice. But sometimes, an
adjournment may well be a way to ensure that justice be done for the case
as a whole. … In dispensing justice, one must always bear in mind the
basic principle of natural justice that is audi alteram partem, … .

C

(emphasis added)

D

E

F

[33] On the facts of this appeal before us, we conclude that there are
adequate reasons for the learned HCJ’s refusal of the adjournment as the
reasons for the refusal for the adjournment lie in the very considerations
under s. 417(1)(e) (reproduced in para. 14(vii) above) because when the
learned HCJ made the order on its own initiative under s. 417(2) of the CPC,
it is an exercise of discretion to transfer the three cases from the Sessions
Court to the High Court pursuant to s. 417(1)(cc) which entails a
consideration whether such an order is expedient for the ends of justice under
s. 417(1)(e). Further, for the reasons explained, there is compliance with the
fourth and fifth principles mentioned in Lee Ah Tee (supra) as all necessary
matters have been considered; neither is the decision not to adjourn exercised
arbitrarily nor has the refusal to adjourn resulted in injustice to the appellant.
Hence we refrain from appellate interference.
Impugned Second Judgment

G

H

I

[34] With respect to the grounds/judgment of 7 February 2019, the
appellant states the learned HCJ did not indicate that it was ‘brief grounds’
or that ‘full grounds will follow’, it was without qualification and that the
grounds were complete to the extent it covered the basis for the orders which
were sealed. The appellant contends that the impugned second judgment
improves, supplements and adds on the decision of 7 February 2019 by,
among others, the inclusion of the HCJ taking the position there was an oral
application by the AG to withdraw the certificates which he allowed, HCJ
“sets out the full reasons” for his decision and the adding of fresh/new
grounds e.g:
Justifying the transfer to Himself by reference to provisions in 417(1) &
(2) CPC, s. 25 and Item 12 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964, s. 39B
Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Article 145(3) Federal Constitution, further
authorities (Lim Shui Wang [1979] 1 MLJ 65 and Fan Yew Teng [1973]
2 MLJ 1) all of which were never raised during the 7/2/2019 proceedings.

[2019] 5 CLJ

(see para 27(a) to (j) appellant’s written submission (withdrawal of s. 418A
certificate) without giving the appellant the opportunity to address. The
appellant cites the following cases of Pacific Forest Industries Sdn Bhd & Anor
v. Lin Wen-Chih & Anor [2009] 6 CLJ 430 at pp. 437 & 438; [2009] 6 MLJ
293 (FC) at 302 [14] & [16] and 303 [17], PP v. Phee Boon Poh & Ors [2018]

Kong Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 404 at p. 409 A-E.
[35] All the aforesaid authorities either deal with unpleaded issues or
entirely fresh or new issues which would require the parties to be heard
before the judge makes a decision. However in the appeal before us,
comparing the decision dated 7 February 2019 and the impugned second
judgment, the learned HCJ did not with respect decide on new or fresh issues
as the appellant contends. We are of the view the issue of ‘the oral
application’ is untenable for the reasons proffered at paras. [25], [26] and [27]
above.
[36] The appellant cites PP v. Heng You Nang [1949] 1 LNS 61; [1949] 15

549 wherein the Federal Court approved of the principle in Ankur Nath
Ganguli and at 562 [39] and [40], held the court is only competent to write
a written judgment and cannot supplement earlier grounds with further
grounds. Primarily, on the facts, these cases can be distinguished.
[37] In PP v. Heng You Nang (supra), at p. 288 left column the court held
that once a judgment in a criminal case has been pronounced and signed it
cannot be altered; “If a written judgment is delivered it is perfected as soon
as it is delivered and signed; if an oral judgment is delivered it is perfected,
in my opinion, as soon as it is pronounced and the effect thereof has been
entered in the judge’s note-book and signed.”

In Habee Bur Rahman (supra), at 194 D-F right column the court held:

It is not permissible for a trial court having signed and delivered its
grounds of decision to supplement the grounds of decision or to amplify
them in any way.

H

It is however not such conduct as can be said to have occasioned a
miscarriage of justice or such as can be said to warrant or require or even
justify the trial being regarded a nullity and the conviction being quashed.
The only effect of it was that the appellate court must consider the
original judgment as it stood and exclude any consideration of the parts
added.

[39] In Ankur Nath Ganguli (supra), the trial judge gave reasons for
convicting the appellant and his judgment was taken by his secretary and was
reduced to a written form. The Court of Appeal at p. 207 left column held
“an addition to the trial judge’s oral judgment cannot form part of the record,
and [the court] can have no regard to it”.

B

[40] In Thitapha Charoenchuea (supra), there were three judgments dated 22
October 2013 and 25 November 2013 and 20 January 2014. The Federal
Court at p. 552 held (3) and (4) found the judgments dated 22 October 2013
and 25 November 2013 were complete judgments and should not be deemed
as simple grounds and the appellant cannot supplement the two judgments
with 25 November 2013 additional judgment which was written after the
appeal was filed; the Federal Court held the double judgment did not affect
the fairness and did not render the proceedings in the appeal void; rather it
was a mere irregularity.

[41] In the present appeal, we find the learned HCJ merely orally gave a
brief decision on 7 February 2019 after hearing the parties. He not give any
signed written judgment on 7 February 2019 in the manner referred to in the
cases at para. [36] above; what the learned HCJ signed as “salinan diakui
sah” was the notes of proceedings of 7 February 2019 and the signature
below the said decision is part of the practice of a judicial officer signing or
initialling his notes of proceedings to show an event has occurred in the
proceedings. This can be seen throughout the notes of proceedings (pp. 5, 13,
19 and 24). Thus the second impugned judgment dated 15 February 2019
ought not to be expunged or disregarded and not form part of the record as
urged upon us by the appellant.
[42] In the event we err in our decision in that the second impugned
judgment ought to be disregarded, following Thitapha Charoenchuea and
Habee Bur Rahman, it is a mere irregularity which does not justify the
proceedings being regarded a nullity and the only effect is we must consider
the decision delivered on 7 February 2019 and disregard the impugned
second judgment. In any event, by way of rehearing this court is entitled to
review and re-evaluate all the evidence available and the submissions of the
parties before us to arrive at our decision in this appeal. Hence there is no
merit in the appellant’s suggestion for this court to set aside the second
impugned judgment and to remit the case to another High Court for full
arguments.

Whether There Is An Implied Power To Withdraw
[43] The relevant provisions in respect of the PP’s power to transfer is

merits reproduction (material parts):

any proceedings which he has power under Clause (3)

B

(emphasis added)

[44] Statutorily, the relevant provisions in respect of the PP’s power to
transfer is provided in s. 417, s. 418 and s. 418A of the CPC. It is to be noted
that these provisions are contained in the CPC titled “Chapter 15 XLII
Transfer Of Criminal Cases”. The relevant provisions are reproduced:

C

High Court’s power to transfer cases
Section 417.

(1) Whenever it is made to appear to the High Court:

application of the Public Prosecutor or the accused
person, or on its own initiative.

[45] In interpreting the abovesaid constitutional and statutory provisions,
the court is required to adopt the purposive approach under s. 17A of the
Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 ie, “a construction that would promote
the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object
is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that
would not promote that purpose or object”. (emphasis added)
[46] The purpose or object of s. 417(1) of the CPC is to ensure that a
transfer order is made by the High Court when an application is made by any
of the parties entitled to apply under s. 417(2) on the basis of the transfer
under s. 417(1)(a) to (e) and the types of order that may be made under
s. 417(1)(aa) to (cc). It is to be noted that the threshold is very low by virtue
of the language used in s. 417(1) in that “when it appears to the High Court
as opposed to “if the court is satisfied”.
[47] In issuing the transfer certificates under s. 418 A of the CPC, the
learned AG was acting under art. 145(3) and art. 145(3A) of the Federal
Constitution. Section 418B of the CPC qualifies the cases to which s. 418A
is applicable as follows:
Cases to which section 418A is applicable

H

418B. Section 418A shall apply to all cases triable under this Code by a
criminal Court subordinate to the High Court, whether the proceedings
are instituted before or after the coming into force of that section,
provided that the accused person has not pleaded guilty and no evidence
in respect of the case against him has begun to be adduced.

certificates for transfer of the cases to the High Court issued therein and the
transfer to be of no effect (p. 125 B-C). However at p. 125 D, His Lordship
stated:
Transmission to the High Court under the section 418A channel therefore
fails but this is not necessarily the end of the matter, as an application by
the Public Prosecutor for transmission under the section 417 channel is
still open and available to him if he chooses to apply thereunder, in which
event the court will consider the application within the ambit of that
statutory provision and on its merits.

[49] Further in PP v. Lim Shui Wang & Ors [1979] 1 MLJ 65 the Federal
Court was asked to rule whether the High Court Judge had power to transfer
the cases under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, 1952 to the subordinate
court. Suffian LP (as he then was) at p. 66 G-I, left column stated:
As the cases in question are criminal, in our judgment the learned judge
could transfer them only in accordance with sections 417, 418 and 418A
of the Criminal Procedure Code. From subsection (2) of section 417 it
is clear that the High Court may transfer a case on the report of the lower
court or on the application of the Attorney-General or, as happened here,
on its own initiative; but this is subject to two restrictions. First, the High Court may
do so only for the reasons stated in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (1) of section
417, and secondly, the High Court may transfer a case only from a subordinate court
to another subordinate court or to itself, but not from itself to a subordinate court.

[50] In PP v. Dato’ Yap Peng [1987] 1 CLJ 550; [1987] CLJ (Rep) 284;
[1987] 2 MLJ 311 , by a majority decision, the Supreme Court declared
s. 418A to be unconstitutional, and void for infringement of
art. 121(1) of the Federal Constitution. Abdoolcader SCJ (as he then was) at
p. 292 (CLJ); p. 321 E (MLJ) stated:
All is not lost however, as an application by the Public Prosecutor under
section 417 would still be open and available to him if he chooses to apply
thereunder, as I said in the Bank Rakyat case when such an application
was in fact made and allowed after the transfer effected under section
418A was vitiated, in which event the High Court will no doubt consider
the application within the ambit of that provision and on its merits.

[51] Further we are of the considered view that the cases of Kieron Stannard
v. Crown Prosecution Service [2019] EWHC 84 (Admin)(QBD) (online print
out) a Community Protection Notice (‘CPN’) issued under s. 43 of the
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014)), Regina v. Bristol City
Council, Ex parte Everett [1999] 1 WLR 1170 (English CA) (an abatement
notice issued under the Environmental Protection Act 1990) and Pembinaan
Batu Jaya Sdn Bhd v. Pengarah Tanah dan Galian, Selangor & Anor [2016]
5 CLJ 250; [2016] 2 MLJ 495 (CA) (revocation by State Authority of
approval for alienation of land) all cited by the respondent are of assistance.
Whilst the fact pattern of these three cases differ from the present case, we
are of the view that the principle that the courts therein have held there was

H

I



[2019] 5 CLJ
A

B

C

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

an implicit power to withdraw although there is no express statutory power
to issue the two documents (two English cases) and no express power of
revocation (the local case) can by analogy be applicable.
[52] We agree with the respondent’s submission that the concept of functus
officio applies to a court of law and not acts of the PP under the Federal
Constitution. As held by the Court of Appeal in Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin
& Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 MLJ 393
at p. 429 G, the doctrine of functus officio is part of the doctrine of res judicata;
hence a party cannot ask the court to re-visit the same dispute. Therefore the
appellant’s submission that the PP cannot be said to have the power to
withdraw a s. 418A certificate as the power is spent when the said certificate
is acted on and the PP is thereafter functus officio bears no merit.
Whether Judge’s Reasoning On Powers Of PP Flawed

D

E

[53] We do not find the learned HCJ’s reasoning on the powers of the
PP flawed as the appellant contends. The reason being he has substantiated
his findings that the PP is empowered to effect withdrawal of the transfer
certificates. The following were cited and considered by him:
(i) Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution - “The [AG] shall have
power, exercisable at his discretion to institute, conduct or
discontinue any proceedings …”.
(ii) Section 376(1) of the CPC – PP shall have control and direction of
all criminal proceedings under the CPC.

F

(iii) Section 254 of the CPC – PP may discontinue proceedings at any
stage of the trial.
(iv) Article 145(3A) of the Federal Constitution.

G

H

I

(v) A withdrawal of the transfer certificates is an exercise of
constitutional authority of the PP within the contemplation of
art. 145(3) of the Federal Constitution citing s. 40(1) of the
Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967.
(vi) Section 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC Act are the
provisions supported by art. 145(3A) of the Federal Constitution
which empower the AG “to determine the courts in which or
the venue at which the proceedings which he has power under
[art. 145(3)] to institute or to which such proceedings shall be
transferred.”. Be that as it may the PP is entitled to take the view that
the constitutionality of s. 418A of the CPC and s. 60 of the MACC
Act may still be challenged.
(vii) The learned HCJ was of the view that the withdrawing of the transfer
certificates previously issued would not cause ramifications which the
lead counsel for the accused implied to be serious and setting an
unhealthy precedent to the administration of the courts. His Lordship



316

Current Law Journal

[2019] 5 CLJ

noted under s. 418B of the CPC and s. 60(5) of the MACC Act, the
certificates of transfer under s. 418A and s. 60 can only validly be
issued by the PP in cases where the accused has not pleaded guilty and
where no evidence against the accused has been adduced as compared
to s. 417(4), where there is no limitation for transfer.

A

(viii) The trial for the three cases (WA-45-2-07/2018, WA-45-3-07/2018
and WA-45-5-08/2018) in respect of the seven charges have not
commenced “with any witness testimony” when the s. 418A and
s. 60 transfer certificates were issued and “neither [has] the trial
started when the [PP] now applies to have the same certificates
withdrawn”.

B

C

(ix) The power of the High Court to transfer cases is found in s. 417 of
the CPC, namely:
(a) parties who can make the application (sub-s. (2);
(b) basis of the transfer (sub-s. (1)(a) to (e); and

D

(c) type of order that may be made (sub-s. (1) (aa) to (cc).
(x) Section 417(2) confers the power of the High Court to order a transfer
on its own initiative which is exercised exceptionally.
We observed that this finding of the learned HCJ is supported by the
authority of PP v. Lim Shui Wang at p. 67 C left column.
(xi) The learned HCJ likened acting on its initiative to the exercise of
revisionary powers of the High Court under the CPC and Courts of
Judicature Act 1964 where the High Court may act on its own motion
and call for the record of proceedings in the subordinate courts.

E

F

(xii) There is no necessity to call for any record of background of the
matter as the High Court was notified of the fact that the seven charges
had been transferred to the same High Court in early August 2018.
(xiii) The learned HCJ relied on PP v. Lim Shui Wang & Ors at p. 66 HI right column as authority that the High Court may transfer on its
own initiative under s. 417(2) of the CPC and such exercise of the
power to transfer is subject to two restrictions.
(xiv) The withdrawal of the s. 418A and s. 60 certificates is only effective
prospectively and has no effect on the proceedings on the seven
charges (which have not been withdrawn) since 4 July 2018 before the
withdrawal which remain valid.
We find the application by the learned HCJ of the doctrine of
prospective overruling is justified as this doctrine is recognised and
applied by the Supreme Court in the case of PP v. Dato’ Yap Peng. At
p. 321 B-D of the judgment, after the court (by majority) declared
s. 418A to be unconstitutional and void as being an infringement of

the provisions of art. 121(1), it applied “the doctrine of prospective
overruling so as not to give retrospective effect to the declaration
made with the result that all proceedings of convictions or acquittals
which had taken place under that section prior to the date of our
judgment in this matter would remain undisturbed and not be
affected, and the appeal was dismissed on this basis”.
(xv) The learned HCJ stated that the prosecution had already delivered
s. 51A documents and certain witness statements to the accused,
issued summons to witnesses to attend trial.

C

D

(xvi) The learned HCJ held the appellant has not shown any prejudice or
injustice occasioned to him by the transfer order of the High Court
acting on its own initiative.
There is no error in the learned HCJ‘s findings above as points (i) to
(xvi) are supported by the applicable law or principles gleaned from
case law alluded to in paras. [43] to [52] above.
Whether The PP Can Attempt To Regularise Where Jurisdiction To Issue
Transfer Certificates Doubted

E

F

G

[54] There was no jurisdictional challenge as to the right of the PP to issue
the transfer certificates under s. 418A of the CPC. This was the finding of
the learned HCJ at paras. [18], [21] and [22] of the impugned second
judgment. We are of the view that the aforesaid finding is legally correct. The
issuance of the transfer certificates is protected by the presumption of
constitutionality. All the PP did was to act in abundance of caution by
withdrawing the certificates.
In PP v. Pung Chen Choon [1994] 1 LNS 208; [1994] 1 MLJ 566 at p. 576
H, the Federal Court held:
First of all, it is clear law that there is a presumption – perhaps even a
strong presumption – of the constitutional validity of the impugned
section and so the burden of proof lies on the party seeking to establish
the contrary. (See PP v. Datuk Harun bin Haji Idris & Ors).

See (i) PP v. Datuk Harun Hj Idris & Ors [1976] 1 LNS 80; [1976] 2 MLJ 116

Transfer under s. 417 CPC
Judge Did Not Act On ‘Own Initiative’ Under s. 417(2) CPC

I

[55] We take note the definition of “on its own initiative” to mean
“without being prompted by others” in the Oxford Dictionary of English 3rd
edn p. 1370 which has been similarly adopted by the Supreme Court of



Current Law Journal

318

[2019] 5 CLJ

Papua New Guinea in State And Another v. Transferees And Another [2015]
PGSC 45 at 517 [78] as follows:
[78] The phrase ‘on its own initiative’. What does the phrase really mean?
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (10th edn) Judy Pearsall (ed) defines
the word ‘initiative’ as the ability to initiate, the power or opportunity to
act before other do, or without being prompted by others. To initiate is
therefore to cause a process or action to begin.

A

B

(emphasis added)

[56] It is our considered view what the learned AG did was merely
highlighting to the learned HCJ the options and left it entirely for him to
decide under s. 417(2) of the CPC. It is observed the “on its own initiative”
among others also means “To initiate is therefore to cause a process or action
to begin” (see State v. Transferees). This is precisely what the learned HCJ did:
acting on the own initiative of the High Court (presided by him as the judge)
in the exercise of his discretion under s. 417(2), he decided that the seven
charges should continue to be tried by the High Court on the basis that it
would be expedient for the ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e) after taking into
account several considerations (paras. [45] to [50] of the impugned second
judgment)
Whether The Judge Could Exercise Power Under s. 417(2) As There Were
No Proceedings Pending At The Sessions Court
[57] The appellant argued that as there were no proceedings pending before
the Sessions Court at the time the s. 418A/s. 60 certificates were withdrawn,
the notional Sessions Court to which the matters revert could not have given
effect to the order of the learned HCJ under s. 417(1)(cc) as it was devoid
of jurisdiction to do so, being not cognized of the affected matters.

C

D

E

F

[58] The learned HCJ has addressed this issue and we find no error in his
judgment as to the effect of the withdrawal of the transfer certificates that:
[F]rom the point of withdrawal (date of this order) is for the 7 charges
to revert to the Sessions Court where they had been originally filed and
registered. When that happens, the 7 charges cease to be registered with
the High Court Registry.
[S]ince the background of the matter had been notified to me sitting as
a High Court judge in the instant proceeding, upon the withdrawal, and
on the own initiative of this Court, I exercised my discretion under
Section 417(2) of the CPC on the basis of Section 417(1)(e) to order the
transfer of the 7 charges (already reverted to the Sessions Court) back to
the same High Court, for the reasons I have stated earlier.

[59] The learned HCJ stated the process of the registration via the routing
system is applicable for transfer applications made by the prosecution or the
accused under s. 417(2). However it is unnecessary for such a formality when
the High Court exercises its discretion to act on its own initiative under

G

H

I



[2019] 5 CLJ
A

B

Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Hj Abdul Razak
v. PP

319

s. 417(2) provided the requirements of s. 417 is adhered, particularly the
ground for the transfer under s. 417(1)(a) to (e). The learned HCJ held that
if the court did not exercise its discretion under s. 417(2), the seven charges
could be registered in any one of the other High Courts and with new trial
dates having to be fixed depending on the availability of trial dates despite
the original trial dates being fixed in February and March 2019, as far back
as August 2018. This state of affairs according to the learned HCJ “does not
accord with the ends of justice under s. 417(1)(e)” and “is plainly
unsatisfactory and patently inconsistent with the ends of justice considering
the circumstances of the case.”

C

We find there is no reason to disturb the learned HCJ’s approach on the
exercise of discretion when determining an application for transfer under
s. 417 of the CPC by drawing a distinction between an application emanating
from the PP and that from an accused person as opposed to the court acting
on its own initiative.

D

Whether The Judge Could Transfer Case Back To Himself

E

F

[60] Once the certificates were withdrawn, the cases reverted to the
Sessions Court where the case was originally registered. We agree with the
learned HCJ of the significance that “[t]hese seven charges have not been
withdrawn and “the process of mentioning the withdrawal of the certificates
in the Sessions Court is merely administrative and does not affect the legal
consequence of the withdrawal which is the seven charges being
automatically reverted to the Sessions Court” (see paras. [73], [78] and [80]
of the second impugned judgment). The learned HCJ has the power to effect
transfer of the case subject to the provisions of the CPC (s. 417) as held in
paras. [63], [64] and [65] of the impugned second judgment.

[61] We hold that the learned HCJ was not transferring the cases to himself
as the appellant contends but rather to the High Court of which he is the
presiding judge in the exercise of its power under s. 417(2) (acting on the own
initiative of the High Court) on the basis of the transfer under
s. 417(1)(e) to order the three cases pending in the Sessions Court to be
transferred to and tried before the High Court under s. 417(1)(cc) of the CPC.
Hence the issue of usurpation of the powers of the Chief Judge of Malaya
does not arise.

Conclusion

I

[62] The learned HCJ has carefully evaluated and judicially appreciated the
facts and law in the instant case. We find there are no appealable errors in
his decision which warrant any appellate intervention. Unanimously, we
accordingly dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the learned
HCJ.
