Legal Network Series

a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case and convicted and
sentenced him accordingly.
2.

At the Session’s court the appellant was charged as follows:
Pertuduhan Pindaan Pertama:
“Bahawa kamu pada 1.10.2002, bertempat di Syarikat Azamat Hati

Sdn. Bhd, sebagai dorongan kepada kamu untuk melakukan satu
perkara, iaitu membantu Chin Ah Lek mendapatkan permit bas bagi
Syarikat Azamat Hati Sdn. Bhd. yang memohon permit bas dari
Lembaga Perlesenan Kenderaan Perdagangan (LPKP), dan dengan

Pertuduhan Kedua:
“Bahawa kamu pada 17 Januari 2003, bertempat di Bank Bumiputra
Commerce, Cawangan Sultan Idris Shah, Ipoh, di dalam Daerah
Kinta, dalam Negeri Perak, telah secara rasuah menerima untuk diri
kamu satu suapan, iaitu wang tunai RM6,000.00 yang telah
dimasukkan ke dalam akaun Bank Bumiputra Commerce kamu,

bawah seksyen 10(a)(aa) Akta Pencegahan Rasuah 1997 yang boleh
dihukum di bawah seksyen 16 Akta yang sama”.

The accused was sentenced with 2 years imprisonment for each
charge. He was also ordered to pay a fine of RM10,000.00 in default
6 months imprisonment for the first charge and RM30,000.00 which
is 5 times the value of the gratification with regards to the second
charge.

4.

The appellant, being aggrieved, have now appealed to this court
against both conviction and sentence.

5.

The relevant sections of the Anti-Corruption Act 1997 (the Act)
referred to in the course of this appeal are as follows:
(A)

Offence of accepting gratification, Section 10
Any person who by himself, or by or in conjunction with any

otherwise on account of(aa) any person doing or forbearing to do anything in
respect of any matter or transaction, actual or
proposed or likely to take place; or
(bb) any officer of a public body doing or forbearing to

place, in which the public body is concerned, shall
be guilty of an offence.

The word “gratification” is defined under section 2 of the Act
to mean:
(a)

money, donation, gift, loan, fee, reward, valuable
security, property or interest in property being property
of any description whether movable or immovable, or

(g)

(C)

Legal Network Series

any offer, undertaking or promise, whether conditional
or unconditional, of any gratification within the meaning
of any of the preceding paragraphs (a) to (f);

The following presumptions in the Act are applicable. The
relevant ones are as follows:

Section 42(1) of the Act.
Where in any proceedings against any person for an offence
under section 10, 11, 13, 14 or 15 it is proved that any
gratification has been accepted or agreed to be accepted,
obtained or attempted to be obtained, solicited, given or
agreed to be given, promised, or offered, by or to the accused,
the gratification shall be presumed to have been corruptly
accepted or agreed to be accepted, obtained or attempted to be
obtained, solicited, given or agreed to be given, promised or
offered as an inducement or a reward for or on account of the
matters set out in the particulars of the offence, unless the
contrary is proved.
Section 44 of the Act which states as follows:
(1) Notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to the contrary,
in any proceedings against any person for an offence under this Act:
(a)

no witness shall be regarded as an accomplice by reason only
of such witness having(i)

accepted, received, obtained, solicited, agreed to accept
or receive, or attempted to obtain any gratification from
any person;

(ii)

given, promised, offered or agreed to give any
gratification; or
6



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

(iii) been in any manner concerned in the commission of such
offence or having knowledge of the commission of the
offence;

6.

(b)

no agent provocateur, whether he is an officer of the Agency
or not, shall be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason
only of his having attempted to commit, or to abet, having
abetted or having been engaged in a criminal conspiracy to
commit, such offence if the main purpose of such attempt,
abetment or engagement was to secure evidence against such
person; and

(c)

any statement, whether oral or written, made to an agent
provocateur by such person shall be admissible as evidence at
his trial.

(2)

Notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to the contrary,
a conviction for any offence under this Act solely on the
uncorroborated evidence of any accomplice or agent
provocateur shall not be illegal and no such conviction shall
be set aside merely because the court which tried the case has
failed to refer in the grounds of its judgement to the need to
warn itself against the danger of convicting on such evidence.

Before proceeding further this court is mindful that the trial court
had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses of the
case. Unless the trial court is plainly wrong in her finding, the
Appellate Court should not reverse a finding of fact by the trial judge
(See Ming Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd v. Tuan Syed Azahari Noh
Shahabudin & Anor [2010] 6 CLJ 857; [2010] 4 MLJ 577). Perhaps
the role of an Appellate Court is best summed up in Davendar Singh
a/l Sher Singh v. PP [2012] 1 LNS 261; [2012] 3 AMR 489 where
the Court of Appeal states as follows:

7



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

“in respect of an appeal, which really turns upon a question of
fact, an appellate court is generally very reluctant to disturb a
finding of fact by any trial judge for the reason that as trier of
fact the trial judge has visual-audio advantage, which we do
not have. Nonetheless, it would be upon us to upset the findings
made by the trial judge if such a finding is not supported by
evidence or the decision is against the weight of the evidence
or there is no proper judicial evaluation of the evidence or
there is misdirection of law or the trial court has
fundamentally misdirected itself.”
Summary of prosecution’s case
7.

The central figure in this case is SP4 (Chin Ah Lek), a share holder
in a company called Azamat Hati Sdn. Bhd. (the company). The
company was an express bus company. SP4 managed the company
with the help of his wife Voon Li Peng (SP9) who is a clerk in the
company. SP14 (Md. Ali Shah Ayoob Hussain Shah) ran a lorry
transport company one floor above SP4’s company. Sometime in
early 2002, SP4 requested the assistance of SP14 to obtain permits
for express buses (the permits) from the relevant authorities namely
the Lembaga Pelesenan Kenderaan Perdagangan (LPKP) for the
company. SP14 then suggested to SP4 be made a director of the
company. This was to facilitate the obtaining of the permits. Pursuant
to this, SP14 was made a director of the company on the 28.2.2002.

8.

SP14 then contacted one Salleh bin Ibrahim (Salleh) to help in the
obtaining of the permits. Salleh however went missing and could not
be traced despite receiving some money from SP14. In the course of
seeking Salleh’s assistance the appellant’s name was mentioned by
Salleh as a person who could assist in obtaining the permits. SP14
went to the “Pejabat Menteri Pembangunan Usahawan” in Kuala
Lumpur to meet the appellant. The appellant was the special officer
8



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

to the Menteri Pembangunan Usahawan then. In other words he
worked for the minister.
9.

At the meeting with the appellant, SP14 narrated the background as
stated above and to seek the appellant’s help in obtaining the permits.
The appellant intimated that he was willing to assist in obtaining the
permits for the company. Before returning to Ipoh SP14 noted down
the appellant’s phone number.

10.

On returning, SP14 discussed with SP4 regarding SP14’s meeting
with the appellant. They decided to meet the appellant at a restaurant
“kepala ikan” in Sentul to discuss further with the appellant on the
obtaining of the permits. A meeting was held at the stated place. The
appellant told SP4 that a new application for permits needed to be
made through the appellant.

11.

Following the above meeting, SP4 received a fax from the appellant
on 1.10.2002. The faxed document contained a sample letter to the
Menteri Pembangunan Usahawan. It was marked P12. The fax
originated from the fax machine of the Kementerian Pembangunan
Usahawan (KPU) and had the fax number 03-2919017. It was sent to
the office of the company.

12.

On the same day 1.10.2002, the appellant telephoned SP4 and SP14.
The appellant informed them that one of the conditions for the
obtaining of the permits was that the appellant’s father, namely
Abdul Rahim bin Ismail be made a director of the company. The
appellant stated that he would fax the identity card of his father to
the company pursuant to this requirement.

13.

On the 1.10.2002, the appellant faxed the identity card of his father.
The faxed document showed that it also originated from the fax
machine of the Kementerian Pembangunan Usahawan. The fax
number was also that of the previous faxed document. This document
9



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

was marked P17. Subsequently SP4 met up with SP14. SP14
explained to SP4 the reason why P17 was sent. Thereafter SP4 agreed
to the appellant’s request that Abdul Rahim bin Ismail be made a
director of the company.
14.

Sometime after that SP14 and the appellant himself together with
others went to meet the company secretary Mirawati bt. Sulaiman
(SP2) at her office and handed over the photostat copy of the identity
card of Abdul Rahim bin Ismail to her. Abdul Rahim bin Ismail was
appointed as the director of the company on 20.12.2002. This is
reflected in the Borang 49 which was exhibited as P8.

15.

Subsequently on 15.1.2003, SP14 had prepared 2 “Borang
Permohonan Bas Express” which were marked P13 and P81
respectively and submitted them to LPKP on behalf of the company.
The company requested for 60 permits in total for various bus routes
along different parts of the country. One common factor in P13 and
P81 was that they named the father of the appellant, Abdul Rahim
bin Ismail, as the director of the company together with SP4 and
SP14.

16.

On 15.1.2003 the Ketua Penolong Setiausaha LPKP, Zainal Kasim
bin Darus (SP10) received the 2 forms (P13 and P81) together with
a “memo” (P18) from the minister with the message “Saudara Zainal
(LPKP), “Sila process untuk kelulusan” and bore the cop of “Azamat
Hati Sdn. Bhd.”. Thereafter SP10 gave P13 and P81 to the clerk to
be processed following what was stated in the memo P18.

17.

The appellant had faxed the minister’s memo (P18) to SP4 at Pejabat
Syarikat Azamat Hati Sdn. Bhd on 15.1.2003.

18.

SP9 is the wife of SP4. She read the faxes received, that is. P12, P17
and P18 to SP4 as SP4 could not read Malay. SP9 also wrote in pen
the date 01-OCT-2002 on P12 and P17. Her explanation was that the
10



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

date in the thermal copies were incorrect as the date in the fax
machine was not correctly set at te time the faxes were received.
19.

On 17.1.2003, the appellant telephoned SP4 and asked for the sum
of RM6,000.00 to be banked to the appellant’s account in Bank
Bumiputra Commerce Bhd. as inducement to obtain the permits for
Syarikat Azamat Hati Sdn. Bhd. The appellant had also given his
bank account number No: 12150032037528 to SP4. On the same day,
SP4 banked in the sum of RM6,000.00 to the appellant’s account at
the Ipoh Branch through the cash deposit slip dated 17.1.2003 (P1).

20.

On the same day 17.1.2003 at about 4.30 pm, while SP4 was in his
office, he received a phone call from the appellant. During the
conversation, the appellant asked SP4 to provide a house, a car and
a monthly salary RM20,000.00 for his father and father in law after
receiving the approval from the LPKP. The appellant asserted that if
the request was not complied with the permits would not be issued
to Azamat Hati Sdn. Bhd. SP4 agreed with the appellant’s request.
The appellant told SP4 that he would fax two letters that would
contain a list of his request to SP4 and asked SP4 to sign and stamp
the company’s stamp on the letters and fax them back to him. Next
at about 4.50 pm, SP4 received 2 faxed letters from the appellant.
SP4 then signed, stamped and faxed the letters back to the appellant
after having discussed with SP14. The originals of the re-faxed
letters duly signed and stamped were tendered as Exhibits P92 &
P93.

21.

A few days later, SP14 was called to attend an interview at the LPKP
office as a formality and thereafter on 28.1.2003 LPKP issued a
notification to collect the offer letters approving 60 “Lesen
Kenderaan Perdagangan” (P19) to Azamat Hati Sdn Bhd. The
appellant himself had handed over the said notification latter to SP4
and SP14 at the “restoran kepala ikan”, Kuala Lumpur. The appellant
11



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

instructed them to go to the LPKP office to collect the award letters
approving the “Lesen Kenderaan Perdagangan”.
22.

Meanwhile on the 30.1.2003 Zainal Kassim (SP10) had taken and
kept the 60 award letters (P20-79) which were received from the
Penolong Pegawai Tadbir LPKP, Azizah bt. Sahar (SP8) as was
stated in the minute sheet of the file pertaining to Syarikat Azamat
Hati Sdn Bhd. (P85).

23.

Following this SP14 went to the LPKP office and showed P19 to
Zainal Kassim (SP10). To SP14’s surprise only 2 of the award letters
were given to him namely P20 and P21. He was told by SP10 to
obtain the rest of the letters (P22-P79) from the accused.

24.

Shortly thereafter the accused brought his father Abdul Rahim bin
Ismail to meet SP10 in his office. The accused introduced his father
as one of the director of the company. On that every day SP10 handed
over the remaining 58 award letters (P22-79) to Abdul Rahim. This
was stated in the minute sheet (P85) in the of Azamat Hati Sdn Bhd
file.

25.

Subsequently SP14 met the accused in Putra Café in Kuala Lumpur
for the remaining 58 award letters to be handed over to him. It was
then that the accused introduced the new conditions as stated in P92
and P93 that needed to be fulfilled before the remaining award letters
could be given to SP14. The accused then requested an additional
bungalow and car for other LPKP officers who he said helped in the
obtaining the permits for the company.

26.

SP14 reiterated the new conditions to SP4 who refused them outright.
On being informed of SP4’s decision the accused informed SP14 that
the permits would be withdrawn.

12



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

27.

Following was followed with the remaining 58 letters of award (20P79) being sent to the company by Abdul Rahim by way of courier.

28.

Things did go according to plan as the LPKP refused to register the
remaining 58 permits when SP14 went to the LPKP office. He was
informed that the Minister had withdrawn the permits. SP14 then
went to see the minister to inquire about the withdrawal of the
permits. According to SP14 no explanation was given. The Minister
however promised that 10 of the permits would be utilised but
nothing came out of this. SP1’s further attempts to see the Minister
also did not materialise.

29.

Siti Fatimah Nur bt Hussain (SP11) the Penolong Pengarah at the
Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara Putrajaya evinced that Abdul Rahim bin
Ismail is the father of the accused. Her evidence was not challenged.

30.

Haslina bt Abdul Malik (SP12) the Penolong Pengurus at Khidmat
Pelanggan in CIMB Bank Kajang Branch confirmed that the account
number 12150032037528 belonged to the accused. She also
confirmed that the sum of RM6,000.00 was deposited into the
account on 17.1.2003.

31.

Iskandar bin Yahya (SP15) who was the Pengurus Perkhidmatan
Pembangunan at Bank Islam Batu Pahat branch confirmed that the
account number 1032010024919 belonged to Abdul Rahim bin
Ismail who is the father of the accused.

32.

Based on the evidence adduced in the prosecution case, the learned
SCJ was correct in invoking the statutory presumption under s. 42 of
the Act where it is presumed that the money was given and received
corruptly and it was then for the appellant to rebut the said
presumption on a balance of probabilities. See PP v. Ku Yahya Ku
Bahari & Anor [2000] 3 CLJ 162, Thavanathan Balasubramaniam v.

13



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

Public Prosecutor [1997] 3 CLJ 150 and PP v. Yuvaraj [1968] 1 LNS
115; [1968] 1 MLJ 238.
33.

This court is also of the view that the SCJ was correct in finding that
the prosecution had proven a prima facie case at the end of the
prosecution’s case and called upon the appellant to enter his defence
for both charges.

The Defence
34.

The appellant gave evidence on oath and called two other witnesses.
The appellant in his defence explained that the only reason he
initially met up with SP4 and SP14 was to hear SP4 complaint against
Ibrahim Salleh.

35.

The appellant denied having any knowledge in the procurement of
bus permits as he was only the special officer to the minister. He
states that he was offered a job by SP14 to be the director of the
company. He declined the offer as he was working with the minister
at that time. The appellant however suggested that his father take up
the position as a director of the company. The appellant asserted that
he never promised SP14 or SP4 anything.

36.

The appellant does not deny that RM6,000.00 was deposited into his
own account. His explanation on this was that he was to fly to
London on a work assignment. He owed the credit card company
RM6,000.00. He did not have the money for expenses for the trip and
therefore borrowed the money from the SP4. He promised to repay
the money upon getting his claims. He gave them his father’s account
number as well for their convenience. He stated that he tried to
contact SP4 to repay the purported debt but could not get in touch
with him. The repayment was only made in 2005 when he found out
that he was being investigated by the authorities for corruption.

14



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

37.

The appellant went on to say that he was surprised that upon his
return from London he was informed by SP10 that the application for
the permits had been approved. His father was also taken aback on
being made a director of the company when he did not sign any
document to that effect. He denies meeting SP10 with his father to
collect the letters of award for the permits.

38.

Finally, regarding the memo signed by the minister (P18, P82 and
P83). The minister in his evidence stated that it was not unusual that
documents with his signature appear on documents and
correspondences. He cannot however remember the matter pertaining
to the memo. He nevertheless does not deny the memo bears his
signature. He stated that the fax machine in his office was only for
his own use. The other fax machines could be used by anyone else.
he denied any knowledge of the company Azamat Hati Sdn Bhd. The
minister’s evidence must be read in the light of SP13’s evidence. He
stated that the fax machine outside the minister’s office could be used
by any of the three special officers (which would include the
appellant) the “setiausaha sulit” and other workers there.

39.

From her grounds it is clear that the SCJ did take into account the
defence put forward by the appellant during the trial. She also
considered the various issues raised by the appellant.

Issues in this Appeal
40.

Learned counsel for the appellant brought up several issues during
submission which will be discussed here. These issues were:

a)

Delay in Charging the Appellant

41.

The offences were committed in the year 2002. The appellant was
however only charged in 2008, six years later. The appellant
contends that there was an inordinate delay in charging him. The
15



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

delay had put him in a disadvantage as memory fades and important
documents become unreadable or are destroyed. The appellant also
submitted that no explanation by prosecution as to the reasons for
the delay.
42.

This court is of the view that although there was the delay in charging
the appellant, there was upon a consideration of all the
circumstances, no prejudice caused to the appellant. While there is
no limitation period in the preferring of criminal charges it behooves
this court to scrutinize the notes of proceedings to see whether the
delay had caused any injustice to the accused. In going through the
notes of proceeding I cannot find any indication that the delay had in
any way affected the testimony of the witnesses. The documentary
evidence supported the oral testimonies of the prosecution witnesses
in material particulars. There is no indication of any tempering of
witnesses either. I therefore find no merit in the contention of the
appellant on this issue.

b) The element of “Membantu” or “assisting”in the charges.
43.

Counsel contended that the words “membantu Chin Ah Lek
mendapatkan permit bas dari Lembaga Perlesenan Kenderaan
Perdagangan (LPKP) ...” signified that the prosecution must prove
that the appellant had in actual fact assisted Chin Ah Lek (SP4). It
was counsel’s contention that the appellant had neither the authority
nor power to “membantu” or assist SP4 to obtain the express permits.
Counsel had quoted the case of PP v. Chua Beng Seong and Another
Case [2016] 5 CLJ 456 to support his contention. Learned counsel
contrasted this case with those where the word “kononnya” preceded
the word “membantu”. In those cases, learned counsel argued that
the prosecution need not proof the actual fact of “membantu”.

44.

It is this court’s view that merely because the charge reads that the
appellant “membantu” or assisted does not mean the prosecution
16



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

would have to prove that the appellant had actually assisted in getting
the permits. Furthermore, it is this courts view that there is no
requirement under Section 10(a)(aa) of the Act that the appellant
himself must have the capability or capacity to assist SP4 to obtain
the bus permits. It is enough that the appellant had held himself out
or represented that he will assist Chin Ah Lek to obtain the permits.
On the facts, this was adequately proven.
45.

I find support in this proposition in Gurbachan Singh v. Public
Prosecutor [1966] 2 MLJ 125 where Yong J stated as follows:
In the case of Charles Victor Carr (1956) 40 Cr App Rep 188;
[1957] 1 WLR 165; [1956] 3 All ER 979, the Court of Criminal
Appeal laid down the principle that on a charge of receiving
bribe under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906, it was not
necessary to prove that favour had been shown. “Prosecution
have merely to prove that the accused person did receive a
bribe as an inducement to show favour: they are not required
to prove that he did actually show favour in consequence of
having received the bribe.” This legal point had been correctly
dealt with by the learned president in his ground of judgment
and no valid reason had been shown for disturbing his
conclusions. (Emphasis added)
Similarly in the See also Md Zaki Fadzil bin Maon v. Pendakwa
Raya [2010] MLJU2060 and PP v. You Kong Lai [1985] 1 MLJ
298.

46.

In any event there is evidence that at the Mesyuarat Lembaga LPKP
did approve the company’s application for the permits although this
was later on withdrawn. This can be seen from the evidence of SP10.

The admissibility of Exhibits P12, P13 and P14

17



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

47.

Counsel also contended that exhibits P12, P13 and P18 were
inadmissible as they were secondary evidence and that there was no
explanation why the original copies of the fax transmissions were not
produced. The appellant out rightly denies sending these documents.
Learned counsel during oral submission on 28.8.2017 stated that
what was produced in court as exhibit was “a photostat copy of a fax
copy” and not the original thermal copy.

48.

On perusal of the appeal record the first time P12 was mentioned was
page 26 of the Rekod Rayuan (RR).
“Ada terima apa-apa fax dari Eswadi?
Pernah.
Boleh cam surat itu?
Boleh.
Satu surat dirujuk - Ini suratnya?
Ya.”

49.

The record states “TPR kemukakan surat fax bertarikh 12.9.2000
untuk ditandakan ID12”.

50.

As for P17 the first time it was mentioned was at page 39 of RR. The
record states “Salinan Kad Pengenalan Abdul Rahim bin Ismail
ditandakan ID17”. 3 lines down the record shows to the question
“Rujuk ID17 ada terima fax ini? PW4 answered “Bulan Oktober
2002.”

51.

Further regarding P18, the firs time it was mentioned was at page 40
RR where it was introduced there in the following manner:
Selepas masukkan nama bapa OKT, apa berlaku?

From the RR the exhibits ID12, ID17 and ID18 were made P12, P17
and P18 through SP9 (Voon Li Peng) who is the wife of SP4. The
relevant page of RR is at pages 79 and 80 of the RR.

ID18 - P18”
53.

It is observed that nothing in the notes of proceedings is it mentioned
the P12, P13 and P14 were photocopies of the fax transmissions as
contended by the learned counsel for the defence. To satisfy myself
as to the nature of those exhibits when they were tendered in court
during the trial I had to physically examine these exhibits.

54.

On examination of the documents this court found that:
(a)

Exhibit P12 it is a photocopy of a fax. At the top left corner is
hand written the date 01-OCT-2002 and 9.10am. It also bore
the abbreviation of KPU (Kementerian Pembangunan
Usahawan) It is a letter To “Mr Ah Lek” from Eswardi
Abd.Rahim.

(b)

Exhibit P17 is the original thermal copy of the fax. It contains
the image, back and front, of the identity card of Abdul Rahim
bin Ismail bearing number 460718-01-6525. It also contains
the “Kad Pesara” of the said Abdul Rahim Bin Ismail. It also
had the hand-written date 01-OCT-2002 at the top left corner.
Exhibit P17 was attached to a photocopy of the original thermal
copy.

(c)

Exhibit P18 is the original thermal copy of the fax. It contains
an official signed memo from “Dato Seri Mohamed Nazri B
Abdul Aziz, Menteri Pembangunan Usahawan” the
handwritten note reads” Saudara Zainal LPKP Sila process
untuk kelulusan” and has the name of the company “Azamat
Hati Sdn Bhd” printed on it. It was also attached to a photocopy

20



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

of the original thermal copy just as in Exhibit P17. The original
of this document was tendered as Exhibit P82.
55.

The original thermal copies had faded to such an extent that the
letterings on them are hardly discernible thus rendering such a
document as good as destroyed. That is why the photocopies were
together with the thermal copies in the first place.

56.

After having examined the exhibits themselves I am of the view that
exhibits P12 is a photocopy of the original thermal copy whereas P17
and P18 are that of the original thermal copies and are therefore
secondary evidence. It is common knowledge that the thermal copies
were produced contemporaneously when the actual documents were
faxed at the other end of the line. The accuracy of thermal copies has
reached a high degree of reliability and accuracy. In the case of
Sinarlim Sdn Bhd v. Medallion Builders Sdn Bhd [2012] 1 LNS 609
her ladyship Mary Lim Thiam Suan J succinctly stated:
I also have no hesitation in concluding that the faxed copies
are properly admitted in evidence. The originals of these
documents marked as “IDs” are clearly with or in the
possession or control of the Defendant. These faxed copies are
actually secondary evidence under section 63 of the Evidence
Act 1950 [Act 56]. Section 63 defines secondary evidence as
including “copies made from the original by mechanical
process which in themselves insure the accuracy of the copy”.
It is without doubt that the faxed copies of the audit
confirmations were made from the originals by the mechanical
process of the facsimile machine. I have no reason to doubt
that such process in itself insures the accuracy of the copy as
seen in the documents received by the Court on a daily and
routine basis, sent generally by lawyers. These copies sent or
received through the facsimile machines have always been
21

accurate copies of the originals - see Supreme Court decision
in Lee Weng Kin v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri
Malaysia & Ors [1991] 1 CLJ 259 (Rep); [1991] 2 CLJ 1301;
[1991] 2 MLJ 472. (Emphasis added)
57.

I am of the opinion that the circumstances of this case calls for the
application of section 65(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1950 which
reads:
65. Cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents
may be given.
(1)

(2)

58.

Secondary evidence may be given of the existence,
condition or contents of a document admissible in
evidence in the following cases:
(c)

when the original has been destroyed or lost, or
when the party offering evidence of its contents
cannot for any other reason not arising from his
own default or neglect produce it in reasonable
time;.........................

(a)

In the cases referred to in paragraphs (1)(a), (c)
and (d) any secondary evidence of the contents of
the document is admissible.” (Emphasis added)

I am supported on this point by the Singapore case Kalki Jewellery
(Suing as a Firm) v. Mani Samikkannu [2000] 2 SLR 179 where
Rajendran J. observed as follows which respect to their section
67(1)(c) which is in pari materia with our section 65(1)(c):
“32 I will now deal with the objections raised by counsel for
the plaintiffs to the admissibility of the copies of the packing
lists (DB.14, 15 and 17) on which KR allegedly acknowledged
receipt of the three consignments.
22



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

Mr Rengarajoo submitted that these three exhibits were not
admissible because the original thermal copies of the faxes
said to be received were not produced. This submission,
however, did not take into account s. 67(1)(c)of the Evidence
Act. It is common knowledge that thermal copies of faxes
disintegrate and it is almost standard commercial practice to
make photo-copies of such faxes for filing. In such a situation,
s. 67(1)(c) could apply. The affidavit evidence-in-chief of
Mani, however, did not contain any explanation as to why Mani
had not produced the original fax that he received. Counsel for
Mani, Mr Ramalingam Kasi, sought leave to adduce that
evidence. I granted leave. Mani then testified that his fax
machine used thermal paper which would fade in time and
that it was his practice to photo-copy incoming faxes and keep
only the photo-copies. In the light of that evidence I was
satisfied that this was a proper case to allow secondary
evidence of the contents of the fax to be introduced, I ruled
that DB.14, 15 and 17 were admissible in evidence.”
(Emphasis added)
59.

Based on the above authorities and section 65 of the Evidence Act
1950 it is this court’s view that P12, P17 and P18 consists of
secondary evidence in which the “contents of the document are
admissible”.

d)

Whether the prosecution had proved “gratification”

60.

Learned counsel for the appellant also contended that the
appointment of the appellant’s father did not amount to
“gratification” as defined in the Act. I am of the view that the
definition of “gratification” is wide enough to cover the demand
made by the appellant that his father be made a director of the
company in return for his assistance in obtaining the permits for the
23



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

company. It is therefore this courts view that the request of the
appellant that his father be made as a director of the company
amounts to a form of gratification. In the circumstances of this case
a directorship in the company would fall within the meaning of
obtaining any “office” or “dignity” in paragraph (b) of the definition
of “gratification” in section 2 of the Act.
e)

Was SP4 an accomplice?

61.

There is no doubt that the main witnesses for the prosecution were
SP4 and SP14. Counsel contends that they were accomplices. This
contention is based on the fact that SP4 had on occasion previous to
this bribed a certain individual by the name of Salleh to obtain
permits. Counsel had also attacked the credibility of SP4 in that he
was willing to do anything to obtain the permits including changing
the composition of the company to give an impression that it was a
bumiputra thus obtaining certain benefits company when in actual
fact he held the reins of the company. In this light counsel contends
that SP4 in particular is unworthy of credit and also an accomplice.

62.

It is this court’s finding that SP4 was not an accomplice. SP4
depended on SP14 and his wife SP9 in communicating with the
accused. His role was only to agree in appointing the appellant’s
father as a director. This too was after consulting SP14. It was the
appellant who was sending SP4 the faxes on the details of his father
and other requests.

63.

Further to this section 44(1)(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Act expressly states
that “no witness shall be regarded as an accomplice by reason only
of such witness having agreed to give any gratification or had been
in any manner concerned in the commission of such offence or having
knowledge of the commission of the offence”. The intent of the
section was thus to place such accomplice evidence on the same
footing as that of ordinary witnesses and therefore there is no
24



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

necessity imposed upon the trial court to warn itself of the dangers
of convicting on such uncorroborated evidence. See PP v. Rahiman
Selamat & Kes Yang Lain [2015] 3 CLJ 92.
64.

Be that as it may, quite apart from the corroboration afforded by the
faxed thermal copies P12, P17 and P18 from fax number 03-2919017
which according to SP13 originated from the place of work of the
appellant, there are also other corroborative evidence in support of
SP4’s evidence in the form of (i) the testimonies of SP9,SP10 and
SP14 (ii) the fact the appellant himself had gone to meet the company
secretary (SP2) at her office to hand over the identity card of his
father to be used to formalise the process of appointing his father as
a director of the company (Exhibit P82) (iii) the approval of the
application for the permits by the minister for whom the appellant
work for as a special officer (iv) the appellant and his father had gone
to LPKP to meet the assistant secretary to the Kementerian
Pembangunan Usahawan dan Koperasi (SP10) to collect the letters
of offer (v) the fact that P4 had received and resent by fax P92 and
P93 with his signature and company stamp at the insistence of the
accused.

65.

Viewing the evidence as a whole in its totality the learned trial judge
was correct in ruling that PW4 and PW14 were truthful witnesses and
that their sworn testimony in respect of the two counts was credible.
SP4’s testimony was consistent throughout on the material facts. His
testimony was also consistent with the testimonies of the other
prosecution’s witnesses.

f)

The Section 42 Presumption

66.

The presumption of gratification being corruptly solicited as
inducement under s. 42(1) derives from the basic fact which is the
solicitation of the gratification. As for the first charge there is ample
evidence the father of the accused had in fact been made the director
25



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

of the company. This was pursuant to the condition imposed by the
appellant for obtaining his assistance in in obtaining the permits.
There was also evidence that among other things a house and cars
the appellant had also asked for the sum of RM6,000 to be deposited
into the appellant’s account (Exhibit P1A and B). This was done as
can be seen the evidence of SP1 the CIMB bank officer. The
gratification is therefore presumed to have been corruptly received.
See PP v. Ku Yahya Ku Bahari & Anorsupra supra, Thavanathan
Balasubramaniam v. Public Prosecutor supra and PP v. Yuvaraj
[1968] 1 LNS 115; [1968] 1 MLJ 238 supra. The effect of such
presumption has been clearly stated in the case of PP v.
Kamaruzaman Bin Sudin [2009] 1 LNS 396 as follows:
Sebaik sahaja anggapan di bawah s. 42(1) APR terpakai
adalah menjadi beban seorang tertuduh bagi mematahkan
anggapan bahawa suapan itu telah diterima secara rasuah.
Bagi berbuat demikian, tanggung jawab pembelaan hendaklah
memanggil saksi-saksi material.
g)

The resignation of the appellant’s father

67.

It was also argued by learned counsel that the appellant’s father,
Abdul Rahim bin Ismail, ceased to be a director as on 10.01.2003.
He was appointed on the 20.12.2002. The application for the permits
was made on the 21.1.2003. Learned counsel contends that the father
of the accused had already resigned by then. He contends that the
gratification would have ceased to have effect by then.

68.

On this issue I would agree with the learned Deputy that for whatever
reason the resignation took place the father of the appellant had been
made a director based on the fact that the application for the permits
would only be approved when his father was made director of the
company. At the time of the submission for the application for the
permits the appellant’s father was included as one of the directors of
26



[2018] 1 LNS 240

Legal Network Series

the company. As stated earlier SP10 stated that the appellant had
represented to him that the father was a director at the time they
collected the letter of offer from SP10. As such the resignation of the
father as a director did not affect the fact that his appointment was
still a form of gratification.
69.

After weighing all the evidence, I find that the appellant’s version of
events goes against the weight of all the evidence presented. It cannot
be a coincidence or an accident that the fax number from which P12,
P17 and P18 were sent to SP4 from the very work place of the
appellant. The same fax number was used for P92 and P93 as well.
There was no reason for any other person to fax to SP4 the identity
card and other information concerning the appellant’s father. It is
also unbelievable also that the appellant was not able to trace SP4
after 3 years to return the RM6000.00 but could bank in the money
with ease into SP4’s account as soon as he realised that the
authorities were investigating him.

70.

This court would therefore not disturb the findings of the SCJ
especially when she had the advantage of seeing and hearing the
witnesses during the trial and was in a better position to access their
credibility.

Conclusion
71.

In the upshot I agree with the learned SCJ that the appellant had
failed to rebut the presumption under section 42 of the Act. The
prosecution had therefore proven their case beyond reasonable doubt.
I am also of the opinion that the sentence imposed by the learned SCJ
is not manifestly excessive considering the nature of the offence
where public interest is at the forefront. I therefore dismiss both the
appeal against conviction and sentence.
