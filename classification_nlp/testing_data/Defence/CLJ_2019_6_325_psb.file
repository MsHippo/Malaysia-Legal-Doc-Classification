of insanity – Accused person suffering from emotional disturbances due to heavy

The respondent, a Vietnamese, worked in Malaysia and stayed with
six others. One morning, one of her housemates (‘SP1’) saw another
housemate (‘the deceased’) sleeping below the staircase and the respondent
coming down the stairs. Five minutes later, SP1 heard the deceased
screaming and saying ‘why do you want to kill me?’ SP1 went to have a look
and saw the respondent holding two knives in each hand. One knife caused
a cut to the deceased’s left neck while the other knife was used to stab the
deceased’s back repeatedly. SP1 later saw the respondent sitting next to the
deceased’s motionless body and heard the respondent asking why was the
deceased sleeping. The respondent then laughed at the deceased before
becoming quiet and remaining at the same spot without holding any weapon.
The deceased was rushed to the hospital while the respondent was left alone
at the house, unlocked. Unfortunately, the deceased succumbed to her
injuries. The pathology report revealed that the deceased died due to the cut
on her neck. The respondent was subsequently charged at the High Court for
murder, an offence under s. 302 of the Penal Code (‘PC’) but was ordered

to be acquitted without her defence being called, on the ground of mental
disorder. Dissatisfied with the order, the prosecution appealed to the Court
of Appeal and a different coram ordered the appellant to enter her defence.
In her defence, which was one of insanity under s. 84 of the PC, she suffered
from emotional disturbances due to heavy consumption of alcohol and
ecstasy. On the fateful day, she heard voices in her head and she could only
recall waking up and seeing the deceased turning into a ghost. The HCJ
concluded that the respondent had successfully brought forth the defence of
insanity as the respondent’s mental capacity, during the commission of the
offence, was affected by the consumption of ecstasy pills and she was
incapable of knowing what she was doing was either wrong or contrary to
the law. The HCJ acquitted the respondent and ordered her to be kept in safe
custody at Hospital Bahagia, Tanjung Rambutan, Perak, under s. 348(1) of
the Criminal Procedure Code (‘CPC’), pending the order to be made by the
Ruler under s. 348(2) of the CPC. Hence, the present appeal by the
prosecution. The prosecution argued that (i) the respondent did not suffer
serious/severe mental illness that entitled her to rely on s. 84 of the PC;
(ii) to be exempted under the said section, mere proof of mental illness alone
was not enough as it should be clearly proved that the respondent (a) was of
unsound mind; (b) was of unsound mind at the time of the commission of the
offence; and (c) the respondent, by reason of insanity, was incapable of
knowing the act and what she was doing was wrong and contrary to the law;
and (d) must prove her cognitive faculties were so impaired that she was
deprived of understanding the nature of the act or distinguish right from
wrong, namely ‘moral wrong’ and not ‘legal wrong’; (iii) section 84 of the
PC does not confer immunity from criminal liability in every case of insanity
of the accused; (iv) the respondent was not completely of unsound mind at
the time of the commission of the offence as (a) she attempted to eliminate
evidence by hiding the knife and cleaning the floor, evinced by a mop soaked
in a pail, found in the kitchen; (b) the forensic team found a plastic bag
containing a mattress, a blanket and pillows stained with the deceased’s
DNA; and (c) she tried to hide the weapons used to kill the deceased as six
knives were found, out of which four were tainted with the deceased’s DNA,
showing that she was aware of what she was doing at the time of the
commission of the offence.
Held (dismissing appeal; affirming decision of High Court)
Per Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA delivering the judgment of the court:
(1) When a plea of insanity is set up, the crucial point of time for
ascertaining the state of mind of the accused is at the time when the
offence was committed. Whether the accused was in such a state of
mind, as to be entitled to the benefit of s. 84 of the PC, could only be
established from the circumstances which preceded, attended and
followed the following crime. Evidence of the mental condition of the
accused during a reasonable period, before and after the commission of

the offence, is relevant. In order to ascertain a person’s mental condition
at the time of the act, it is permissible to receive evidence of his/her
mental condition during a reasonable period before and after the act. A
person’s mind could only be fathomed by external acts; his/her
thoughts, motives and emotions might be evaluated to determine
whether his/her external acts conform to those people of sound mind.
(paras 22 & 23)
(2) The absence of the legally-relevant capacities due to voluntary
intoxication from alcohol or drugs is not considered as basis for insanity
defence, as stated in s. 85(ii) of the PC. It could only be considered as
a basis for a defence when substance had been administered to the
accused involuntarily. The underlying moral and legal principle for this
exception is the premise that an insane person should be excused from
punishment of his/her lack of control over the presence of the mental
illness and because the mental illness was brought on due to to external
circumstances. Thus, individuals who voluntarily take substances
leading to the deprivation of relevant capacities should be held
responsible for their actions. However, mental illness which are the
direct effect of psychoactive substances, such as ecstasy, are considered
as a basis for insanity defence under the law. (para 32)
(3) The granting of absolution of criminal liability, on the basis of insanity,
should be done with utmost care and circumspection as the court must
keep its guard against murderers seeking to escape punishment through
a plea of insanity. The case at hand, however, did not indicate that the
defence of insanity was merely used as a convenient tool to evade
culpability. The HCJ made the correct decision, based on the applicable
law and the evidence, in acquitting the respondent on the ground of
insanity and in making the order under s. 348(1) of the CPC. (para 33)
(4) The respondent was suffering from unsoundness of mind at the time
when she did the act and she was incapable of knowing the nature of the
act or she did not know what she was doing was either wrong or it was
contrary to the law. While there was no direct evidence to show the
respondent’s state of mind at the exact moment the crime was
committed, this was not fatal to the finding that she was insane. Her
insanity may still be shown by circumstances immediately after the
incident. SP1, who testified on the respondent’s behaviour and conduct
after the incident, stated that she heard the respondent asking why was
the deceased sleeping and laughing at the deceased. The expert opinion
of a medical doctor (‘SD2’) may also be taken into account. According
to SD2, at the time of the commission of the offence, the respondent was
in the state of unsoundness and she did not know that she what she was
doing was contrary to the law. (paras 24-27)

(5) As observed by the HCJ, the respondent truly did not understand the
nature of her act at the time of killing the deceased. On the issue that
the respondent had hidden the knife in a bag and the mattress, blanket
and pillows found in a plastic bag, these were purely assumptions made
by the prosecution without evidence. The mop inside the pail was also
insufficient to establish that it was the respondent who had used it to
clean the scene since the blood traces remained there. The scene could
have been totally cleaned if the culprit intended to wash away the
evidence since she was left alone when everybody left for the hospital.
The averments about the six hidden knives was unsustainable as the
prosecution had not tendered proof to confirm that it was the conduct
of the respondent. Furthermore, the respondent could have fled away
from the scene since she was left alone in the house after the incident
if she knew what she was doing was contrary to the law. (para 29)

Bahasa Malaysia Headnotes
Responden, seorang warganegara Vietnam, bekerja di Malaysia dan tinggal
bersama-sama enam yang lain. Satu pagi, salah seorang rakan serumahnya
(‘SP1’) melihat seorang lagi rakan serumah mereka (‘si mati’) tidur di bawah
tangga dan responden menuruni tangga. Lima minit kemudian, SP1 terdengar
si mati menjerit dan berkata ‘kenapa awak ingin bunuh saya?’ SP1 pergi
melihat dan ternampak responden memegang dua belah pisau dalam setiap
tangan. Satu tangan menyebabkan luka pada bahagian kiri leher si mati
manakala satu lagi pisau diguna menikam belakang badan si mati bertubitubi. SP1 kemudian melihat responden duduk di sebelah mayat kaku si mati
dan mendengar responden bertanya kenapa si mati tidur. Responden
seterusnya mentertawakan si mati sebelum berdiam dan kekal di tempat yang
sama tanpa memegang apa-apa senjata. Si mati dikejarkan ke hospital
manakala responden ditinggalkan sendirian di rumah, tanpa berkunci.
Malangnya, si mati meninggal dunia. Laporan patologi mendedahkan si mati
meninggal dunia akibat luka pada lehernya. Responden dituduh di
Mahkamah Tinggi kerana membunuh, satu kesalahan bawah s. 302 Kanun
Keseksaan (‘KK’), tetapi diperintahkan agar dilepaskan tanpa dipanggil
membela diri, atas alasan gangguan mental. Tidak berpuas hati dengan
perintah tersebut, pihak pendakwaan merayu di Mahkamah Rayuan dan
kuorum berbeza memerintahkan perayu membela diri. Dalam
pembelaannya, iaitu tidak sempurna akal bawah s. 84 KK, dia mengalami
gangguan emosi akibat pengambilan berlebihan alkohol dan ekstasi. Pada
hari kejadian, dia mendengar suara-suara dalam kepalanya dan hanya boleh
mengingat bangun tidur dan melihat si mati menjadi hantu. Hakim
Mahkamah Tinggi memutuskan responden berjaya mengemukakan
pembelaan tidak sempurna akal kerana kapasiti mental responden, semasa
pelakuan kesalahan, terjejas akibat pengambilan pil-pil ekstasi dan dia tidak
mampu tahu apa-apa yang dilakukannya; sama ada salah atau bercanggah
dengan undang-undang. Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi membebaskan responden
dan memerintahkan agar dia diletakkan bawah jagaan Hospital Bahagia,

Tanjung Rambutan, Perak, bawah s. 348(1) Kanun Tatacara Jenayah (‘KTJ’),
sambil menanti perintah dibuat oleh Pemerintah bawah s. 348(2) KTJ. Maka
timbul rayuan ini oleh pihak pendakwaan. Pihak pendakwaan menghujahkan
(i) responden tidak mengalami apa-apa penyakit jiwa yang melayakkannya
bersandar pada s. 84 KK; (ii) agar dikecualikan daripada seksyen ini, bukti
penyakit jiwa semata-mata tidak cukup kerana harus dibuktikan dengan jelas
bahawa responden (a) tidak sempurna akal; (b) tidak sempurna akal semasa
melakukan kesalahan tersebut; (c) responden, akibat tidak sempurna akal,
tidak mampu tahu bahawa pelakuan dan apa-apa yang dilakukannya salah
dan bercanggah dengan undang-undang; dan (d) mesti membuktikan fakulti
kognitifnya sangat terganggu hingga dia terhalang daripada memahami sifat
pelakuannya atau membezakan yang salah dengan yang betul, khususnya
‘kesalahan moral’ dan bukan ‘kesalahan undang-undang’; (iii) seksyen 84 KK
tidak memberi kekebalan daripada liabiliti jenayah dalam setiap kes tidak
sempurna akal seseorang tertuduh; (iv) responden tidak sepenuhnya tidak
sempurna akal semasa pelakuan kesalahan tersebut kerana (a) dia cuba
melenyapkan bukti dengan menyembunyikan pisau dan membersihkan
lantai, terbukti dengan pengelap lantai yang terendam di dalam baldi, yang
dijumpai di dapur; (b) pasukan forensik menjumpai satu beg plastik yang
mengandungi tilam, selimut dan bantal-bantal yang mempunyai DNA si
mati; dan (c) dia cuba menyembunyikan senjata-senjata yang digunakan
untuk membunuh si mati kerana enam bilah pisau dijumpai, yang empat
daripadanya mempunyai DNA si mati, menunjukkan dia sedar akan apa-apa
yang dilakukannya semasa pelakuan jenayah tersebut.
Diputuskan (menolak rayuan; mengesahkan keputusan Mahkamah
Tinggi)
Oleh Mohd Zawawi Salleh HMR menyampaikan penghakiman
mahkamah:
(1) Apabila satu pli ketidaksempurnaan akal dikemukakan, titik masa yang
penting untuk menentukan keadaan minda seseorang tertuduh ialah
semasa jenayah tersebut dilakukan. Sama ada seseorang tertuduh dalam
keadaan minda yang melayakkan manfaat s. 84 KK, hanya boleh
dibuktikan melalui hal-hal keadaan yang mendahului, berlaku dan
menuruti jenayah yang dilakukan. Keterangan keadaan mental tertuduh
semasa tempoh munasabah, sebelum dan selepas pelakuan jenayah,
adalah relevan. Dalam menentukan keadaan mental seseorang semasa
pelakuan, adalah dibolehkan untuk menerima keterangan tentang
keadaan mentalnya semasa tempoh munasabah sebelum dan selepas
pelakuan. Minda seseorang hanya boleh diukur melalui pelakuanpelakuan luarannya; fikiran, motif dan emosinya akan dinilai untuk
menentukan sama ada pelakuan-pelakuan luarannya selaras dengan
orang yang sempurna akal.
(2) Ketiadaan kapasiti-kapasiti yang relevan, bawah undang-undang, akibat
kemabukan sengaja alkohol atau dadah tidak dianggap asas pembelaan
tidak sempurna akal, seperti yang diperuntukkan bawah s. 85(ii) KK. Ini



330

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

hanya boleh dianggap sebagai asas satu pembelaan apabila bahan
tersebut dimasukkan ke dalam tertuduh tanpa sengaja. Prinsip moral dan
undang-undang yang menjadi dasar pengecualian ini ialah asas bahawa
seorang yang tidak sempurna akal harus dikecualikan daripada hukuman
kerana ketiadaan kawalan akibat kewujudan penyakit jiwa dan kerana
penyakit jiwa ini disebabkan oleh hal-hal keadaan luaran. Oleh itu,
individu-individu yang mengambil bahan-bahan yang mengakibatkan
halangan kapasiti-kapasiti relevan harus dipertanggungjawabkan atas
tindakan-tindakan mereka. Walau bagaimanapun, penyakit jiwa yang
berakibat langsung daripada bahan-bahan psikoaktif, seperti ekstasi,
dianggap sebagai asas untuk pembelaan bawah undang-undang.
(3) Pemberian pengampunan untuk liabiliti jenayah atas dasar tidak
sempurna akal harus dibuat dengan penuh hati-hati dan melalui budi
bicara kerana mahkamah harus berwaspada terhadap pembunuhpembunuh yang ingin mengelak hukuman melalui pli tidak sempurna
akal. Kes ini, walau bagaimanapun, tidak menunjukkan pembelaan tidak
sempurna akal digunakan semata-mata sebagai alat yang mudah untuk
mengelak kebersalahan. Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi membuat keputusan
yang betul, berdasarkan undang-undang terpakai dan keterangan, dalam
membebaskan responden atas alasan tidak sempurna akal dan membuat
perintah bawah s. 348(1) KTJ.
(4) Responden tidak sempurna akal semasa dia melakukan pelakuan
tersebut dan dia tidak mampu mengetahui sifat pelakuannya atau dia
tidak tahu apa-apa yang dilakukannya salah atau bercanggah dengan
undang-undang. Walaupun tiada keterangan langsung yang, secara tepat,
menunjukkan keadaan mental responden semasa jenayah dilakukan, ini
tidak menjejaskan dapatan bahawa dia tidak sempurna akal.
Ketidaksempurnaan akalnya masih boleh ditunjukkan melalui hal-hal
keadaan sejurus selepas insiden tersebut. SP1, yang memberi keterangan
tentang tingkah laku dan kelakuan responden selepas insiden tersebut,
menyatakan dia mendengar responden bertanya kenapa si mati tidur dan
mentertawakan si mati. Pendapat pakar doktor perubatan (‘SD2’) juga
boleh diambil kira. Menurut SD2, pada masa pelakuan kesalahan
tersebut, responden dalam keadaan tidak sempurna akal dan dia tidak
tahu apa-apa yang dilakukannya bercanggah dengan undang-undang.
(5) Seperti yang dinyatakan oleh HMT, responden benar-benar tidak faham
sifat tindakannya semasa membunuh si mati. Berkenaan isu responden
menyembunyikan pisau tersebut di dalam beg dan tilam, selimut dan
bantal-bantal yang dijumpai di dalam beg plastik, kesemua ini sematamata andaian pihak pendakwaan tanpa keterangan. Pengelap lantai di
dalam baldi juga tidak cukup untuk membuktikan responden yang
menggunakannya untuk membersihkan tempat kejadian kerana kesan
darah masih kekal di situ. Tempat kejadian ini mungkin akan
dibersihkan sepenuhnya jika orang yang melakukan kesalahan berniat

mencuci bersih bukti kerana dia ditinggalkan bersendirian apabila
semua orang pergi ke hospital. Hujahan tentang enam bilah pisau yang
disembunyikan tidak boleh dikekalkan kerana pihak pendakwaan tidak
mengemukakan bukti untuk mengesahkan ini dilakukan oleh responden.
Tambahan lagi, responden boleh melarikan diri dari tempat kejadian
kerana dia ditinggalkan bersendirian di rumah, selepas insiden, jika dia
tahu apa-apa yang dilakukannya bercanggah dengan undang-undang.

Facts Of The Case
[3]
The relevant part of the evidence led for the prosecution in the High
Court as summarised by the learned trial judge and recounted by learned
Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) in the appellant’s written submission is
as follows:
(i) The respondent is a Vietnam national working in Malaysia as a
waitress at a night club karaoke. She stayed with six others in a double
storey house bearing address as in the charge. Her housemates are Ha
Ngoc Lich (SP1), Wong Zey Hong, Dang Thi Thu Ha, Tron Diem
My, Nguyen Thi Son and Huynh Thi Y (the deceased).
(ii) On the fateful day, SP1, after having breakfast, went up to her room
to rest. On the way up to her room, SP1 saw the deceased was sleeping
below the staircase. At that material time, SP1 saw the respondent on
her way down from her room situated at the upper floor of the house.
(iii) After five minutes, SP1 heard the scream from the deceased who
uttered words: “why do you want to kill me?”.

B

C

D

E

(iv) SP1 went to look what had actually happened. She saw the respondent
was holding two knives in each hand. One knife was used to cut the
deceased’s left neck and the other knife was used to stab at the back
of the deceased repeatedly.
F

(v) After seeing that, SP1 was in state of fear and returned to her room
to inform the incident to Tran Diem May (“Tran”). Tran immediately
called Michael Wong Ho Sang (“Michael”) for help. Michael came to
the house with his brother after about ten minutes. SP1 went down to
open the door for them. While SP1 was walking past the deceased’s
body, SP1 saw the accused was sitting beside the deceased’s body
which was motionless. SP1 also heard the respondent asked the
deceased why was the deceased sleeping. The respondent also laughed
at the deceased.
(vi) After a while, the respondent became very quiet and remained at same
place but without holding any weapon.
(vii) Michael’s brother in law carried the deceased to a car. All of them,
including other residents of the house, went together to Hospital Sg
Long, Kajang and left the respondent alone in the house without
locking the doors of the house.
(viii) The deceased was pronounced dead after 30 minutes of her arrival at
the Sg Long Hospital.

(ix) At 2.28pm, ASP Chay HuYan (SP2) (investigating officer) was
informed about the deceased’s death. SP2 together with one ASP
Mobin and photographer rushed to the Hospital Sg Long.
(x) The pathologist, Dr Abdul Karim bin Tajudin, conducted the post
mortem examination on the body of the deceased. He concluded that
she died mainly due to the cut on her neck. According to the
pathologist, although there were several stab wounds on the deceased’s
body, the main cause of death was the cut or incised wound of her neck
which had severed her carotid artery (See post mortem report
(exh. P37).
Finding At The End Of The Prosecution’s Case
[4]
At the end of the prosecution’s case, the learned trial judge ordered the
respondent to be acquitted without her defence being called on the ground
of mental disorder.

D

E

[5]
Being dissatisfied with the impugned order, the PP appealed to the
Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal (Mohtarudin Baki, Prasad Sandhosam
Abraham and Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil JJCA) ordered that the defence of the
appellant be called in accordance with the procedures specified in law.
[6]
Accordingly, the learned trial judge called the respondent to enter her
defence.
Version Of The Defence

F

[7]
The respondent elected to give written unsworn statement from the
dock. The respondent sets up insanity as her defence. Her version of the facts
is as follows:
Nama saya Pham Ti Thuyet Mai, saya warganegara Vietnam. Umur saya
32 tahun.

G

Saya datang ke Malaysia tahun 2012. Saya dulu bekerja sebagai pelayan
di pusat hiburan.
Dulu saya banyak minum arak dan ambil dadah. Saya ambil pil ‘ecstasy’.
Saya selalu sakit dan rasa takut, perasaan saya selalu terganggu. Saya ada
masa rasa sangat suka dan ada masa rasa sangat sedih dan takut.

H

I

Saya selalu rasa macam ada orang mahu membunuh saya dan saya dalam
bahaya. Saya tak boleh tahan, dan saya balik ke Vietnam untuk satu bulan
bagi rawatan tradisional.
Selepas satu bulan, saya rasa saya boleh balik ke Malaysia dan kerja
semula. Mula-mula saya tak sakit, tapi lama-lama, saya rasa macam
gangguan emosi lagi, saya perasaan bahawa saya macam dengar ada bunyi
dalam kepala saya, saya selalu nangis dan tak mahu campur kawan-kawan
lain.
Sekali lagi, saya ambil pil ecstasy setiap malam, saya juga tak boleh tidur
malam. Saya selalu bangun malam, jalan-jalan dalam rumah saya. Saya
selalu mimpi macam-maam perkara yang menakutkan.

Pada hari saya bunuh Huynh Thi Y, saya hanya boleh ingat, saya bangun
tidur, saya dan Huynh Thi Y sudah ubah jadi hantu.
Saya dengar macam-macam suara dalam kepala saya dan saya tengok,
saya mesti mahu bunuh Huynh Thi Y supaya itu hantu boleh mati, dan
saya perlu bunuh Huynh Thi Y untuk bukti sama ada Huynh betul-betul
sudah jadi hantu.

A

B

Saya masuk dapur untuk ambil dua pisau, tapi saya tidak mahu bunuh,
saya jalan-jalan dalam ruang dapur dan ruang tamu.
Saya sangat runsing saya dengar macam-macam suara dan lihat macammacam orang. Saya takut, saya ada naik tangga mahu masuk bilik, tapi
saya tak tahu kenapa, saya tak masuk bilik, saya turun balik, saya terus
pergi dekat Huynh Thi Y dan saya tikam dia.

C

Itu sahaja saya ingat, tapi saya selepas itu ada panggil dia supaya bangun
dari tidur. Saya tengok banyak darah. Saya duduk dengan Huynh Thi Y,
saya panggil dia lagi.
Saya ada cakap dengan kawan lain, tolong panggil Huynh Thi Y suruh
bangun mahu keluar, tapi mereka lari.

D

Saya sehingga beberapa hari, saya tak ingat saya sudah tikam mati Huynh
Thi Y.
Saya jerit, nangis bila tahu dia sudah mati. Saya kawan baik dia, kami kerja
di tempat yang sama dan tidur bilik yang sama. Sehingga hari ini, saya
sedih dan keliru apa yang telah berlaku.

E

Itu sahaja saya mahu cakap.

[8]
The defence called a medical doctor, Dr Hjh Robaiah binti Mohd
Salleh (SD2) to support the respondent’s case.

F

Findings At The Close Of Defence’s Case
[9]
The learned trial judge concluded that the respondent had successfully
put forth the defence of insanity as the mental capacity of the respondent
during the commission of the offence was affected by the consumption of
ecstasy pills. Consequently, the respondent was incapable of knowing what
she was doing was either wrong or contrary to the law during the commission
of the offence.
[10] The learned trial judge found that the reasoning given by SD2 who had

[11] As we have alluded earlier, the learned trial judge acquitted the
respondent on the ground that although she had committed the act, she was
incapable of knowing the nature of the act to be wrong or contrary to the law
by reason of unsoundness of mind.
[12] The learned trial judge then ordered the respondent to be kept in safe
custody at Hospital Bahagia, Tanjung Rambutan, Perak under s. 348(1) of the
CPC pending the order to be made by the Ruler under s. 348(2) of the CPC.

The Appeal
[13] Learned DPP submitted that the evidence adduced by the defence is
insufficient to establish her claim of insanity at the time she killed the
deceased.

B

C

[14] Learned DPP posited that since insanity is a condition of the mind,
it is not susceptible of the usual means of proof. As no man can know what
is going on in the mind of another, the state or condition of a person’s mind
can only be measured and judged by his or her behaviour. Thus, the vagaries
of the mind can only be known by means of which we read the thoughts,
motives, and emotions of a person, and then determine whether the acts
conform to the practice of people of sound mind.
[15] Learned DPP took us through the following facts in support of her
contention that the respondent was not completely of unsound mind at the
time of the commission of the offence:

D

E

F

G

H

I

(i) The exhibits such as the knife (photo as in exh. P39(28)) used to stab the
deceased’s backbone which was found in a bag (photo as in
exh. P39(27)) near the entrance (photos as in exh. P39(25) and exh.
P39(26)) clearly showed that the respondent was deliberately trying to
hide the knife. The forensic team also found a black plastic bag at the
living room (photo as in exh. P39(29)) and inside the bag there were
orange mattress, black/brown blanket, blue and red/green pillows
tainted with the deceased’s DNA. A reasonable inference that could
made was that the respondent had attempted to eliminate evidence;
(ii) In exh. P38 (Laporan Pemeriksaan Tempat Kejadian) under the part
“19. Ulasan”, there was a mop soaked inside a pail in the kitchen. It
could be inferred that the respondent had cleaned that floor as only little
blood trace was found at the floor of the living room. This showed that
the respondent was trying to destroy the evidence remained at the scene;
and
(iii) There were six knives hidden under mattress (photos in exh. P39(43) –
(53) in PW1’s room. PW1 had explained that she did not keep the
knives and had no knowledge about the existence of the knives in her
room. After analysis, four of the six knives were found to have been
tainted with the deceased’s DNA profiles. The act of the respondent in
hiding the weapons used to kill the deceased showed that she was aware
of what she was doing at the time of the commission of the offence.
[16] Learned DPP further contended that establishing the insanity of an
accused often requires opinion testimony which may be given by a witness
who is intimately acquainted with the accused; has rational basis to conclude
that the accused was insane based on his own perception; or is qualified
expert, such as a psychiatrist.

[17] In this connection, SD2 who examined the respondent testified as
follows at pp. 22-23, RR, vol. 2:
TPR

A

: Saya rujuk kepada report doktor, mukasurat 3 tadi. Dalam
kesimpulan ini, setuju doktor nyatakan di sini, Cik Pham dia
tidak menghadapi penyakit mental yang serius?

SD2 :

Saya setuju bahawa saya menulis ayat ini. Saya setuju.

TPR :

Dan ini adalah hasil daripada pemerhatian dan juga doktor
punya kajian terhadap pesakit sepanjang pesakit berada di
bawah tahanan Hospital Bahagia, setuju doktor?

SD2 :

Saya setuju bahawa saya telah menulis ayat ini tapi di sini saya
mungkin terangkan. Saya perlu terangkan, Yang Arif bahawa di
dalam psychology world, language orang-orang psikiatri ini
apabila kita cakap penyakit mental yang serius ini kita maksud
tiga penyakit yang saya cakap tadi itu.

Mah :

Itu maksudnya.

SD2 :

Skizofrenia, bipolar mood disorder and depression. So, this was
the message yang di tulis di sini. Iaitu bukan tiga penyakit
mental yang serius.

Mah :

Makanya tidak menghadapi penyakit mental yang serius dalam
laporan kita bermaksud bukan tiga penyakit tadi?

SD2 :

Kita bukan cerita pasal tahap. We’re not talking about tahap
serius tak serius, kan? Yang tadi itu cerita mengenai tahap.

Mah :

Yang saya faham tahap disoal tadi. SD2: Itu semua tahap.

Mah :

Yang dimaksudkan di sini bukan tahap. Bukan tiga tadi?

SD2 :

Bukan.

[18] Learned DPP submitted based on the expert opinion above, the
respondent did not suffer serious/severe mental illness that entitled her to
rely on s. 84 of the PC. According to learned DPP, to be exempted under
this section, mere proof of mental illness alone is not enough. It should be
clearly proved that:

B

C

D

E

F

G

(i) the respondent was of unsound mind;
(ii) the respondent was of unsound mind at the time of the commission of
the offence; and
(iii) the respondent by reason of insanity, was incapable of knowing the act
and that what she was doing was wrong and contrary to the law. It is
not sufficient to prove merely the presence of mental derangement or
psychotic illness. The respondent must prove her cognitive faculties
were so impaired that she was deprived of understanding the nature of
the act or distinguish right from wrong: “wrong” here means moral
wrong and not legal wrong.

[19] Learned DPP further contended that this section does not confer
immunity from criminal liability in every case of insanity of the accused.
Coupled with the insanity of the accused, there must be the additional fact
that at the time of the commission of the act, she is in consequence of the
insanity, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that she is doing
what is either wrong or contrary to law. It is settled principle that “every
person is sane unless contrary is proved” and the onus of proving insanity
is upon who pleads it as a defence and is based on a balance of probabilities
(See John Nyumbei v. PP [2007] 2 CLJ 509; PP v. Arokiasamy Alphonso [2012]
6 CLJ 117; Juraimi Husin v. PP [1998] 2 CLJ 383; [1998] 1 MLJ 537;

1 MLJ 6; Goh Yoke v. PP [1969] 1 LNS 48; [1970] 1 MLJ 63).
Our Findings

D

[20] The central issue in this instant appeal is whether the learned trial
judge erred in holding that the respondent had succeeded in establishing that
she was in such a state of mind as to be entitled to the benefit of s. 84 of the
PC.

E

[21] According to s. 105 of the Evidence Act 1950, the burden of proof in
a case where insanity is set up as a defence is upon the accused person.
However, this requirement of proof is not heavy as on the prosecution to
prove the offence and is based on a balance of probabilities.

F

[22] When a plea of insanity is set up, the crucial point of time for
ascertaining the state of mind of the accused is at the time when the offence
was committed. Whether the accused was in such a state of mind as to be
entitled to the benefit of s. 84 of the PC can only be established from the
circumstances which preceded, attended and followed the crime.

H

[23] We agreed with submission of learned DPP that the evidence of the
mental condition of the accused during a reasonable period before and after
the commission of the offence is relevant. Thus, in order to ascertain a
person’s mental condition at the time of the act, it is permissible to receive
evidence of his mental condition during a reasonable period before and after
the act. A person’s mind can only be fathomed by external acts, thereby his
or her thoughts, motives and emotions may be evaluated to determine
whether his or her external acts conform to those people of sound mind.

I

[24] In this instant appeal, the evidence on record supports the findings of
the learned trial judge that the respondent was suffering from unsoundness of
mind at the time when she did the act and she was incapable of knowing the
nature of the act or she did not know that what she was doing was either
wrong or it was contrary to law.

[25] It is true that there is no direct evidence to show the respondent’s
mental state of mind at the exact moment the crime was committed. This,
however, is not fatal to the finding that she was insane. Her insanity may still
be shown by circumstance immediately after the incident.

behaviour and conduct after the incident, to wit:

[27] Further, the expert opinion of SD2 (Dr Hjh Robaiah binti Mohd
Salleh) may also be taken into account. SD2 categorically testified that at the
time of the commission of the offence the respondent was in the state of
unsoundness and she did not know that what she was doing was contrary to
law. In her testimony, SD2 stated as follows:
During Examination in Chief

maklumat serta daripada pemeriksaan dan pemerhatian oleh
saya, pegawai perubatan dan anggota-anggota paramedic, saya
berpendapat bahawa Cik Pham Ti Tuyet Mai tidak menghidap
penyakit mental yang serius. Walau bagaimanapun, saya juga
berpendapat bahawa semasa kejadian beliau berada di dalam

keadaan tidak waras dan tidak sedar bahawa perbuatannya
adalah salah di sisi undang-undang. Ini adalah disebabkan oleh
gejala-gejala psikosis yang disebabkan oleh pengambilan dadah
jenis ecstasy yang berterusan dan di masa saya menulis laporan

dihadapkan ke mahkamah untuk dibicarakan dan boleh

S

J

: Doktor sangat pakar dalam perkara ini saya ingin bertanyakan
satu soalan luar daripada report doktor. Adakah pengambilan

behaviour, psychotic disorder including depression, anxiety,
imposivity, obsessive composite disorder dan kemungkinan
major depression and schizophrenia. Adakah perkara-perkara ini

[28] The learned trial judge has proffered his reasons as to why he accepted
the expert evidence of SD2. His Lordship found that the evidence of SD2
was credible and inherently probable. The learned trial judge said at pp. 28
– 29, AP vol. 1:
Credibility of SD2

B

C

D

E

F

G

33. The Prosecution had attempted to challenge the evidences given by
SD2 and discredit her expertise. However, the Prosecution did not make
any application to provide other expert witness to counter this before
examination of SD2. Neither did the Prosecution call any expert evidence
to rebut the evidence of SD2 at this trial.
34. In my considered view, this Court is entitled to accept the opinion of
SD2 and D133 on its face value unless the prosecution had called another
expert evidence in rebuttal to contradict her.
35. Essentially, the expert opinion given in evidence at this trial is a matter
of fact. In this aspect, the Court could ask the relevant questions to SD2
for clarification to enable SD2 to provide cogent reason for her conclusion
(See Dr. Shanmuganathan v. Periasamy s/o Sithambaram Pillai [1997] 2 CLJ
153; [1997] 3 MLJ 61). This Court is not bound by the expert opinion and
could for its own opinion to form its findings.
36. The Prosecution also submitted that the time of examination
conducted by SD2 was too long after the incident resulting the findings
might be inaccurate. Be as it may, this Court would reach the same
findings because the Court actually made evaluation basis by scrutinizing
all the available evidences meticulously and not based on medical opinion
solely.
37. On the issue of delay of the doctor in examining the Accused, in my
opinion, this is a strong disinclination to criticise the accuracy of the
medical examination due to police’s negligence. Indeed, the investigating
Officer has a duty to uphold fairness towards the Accused throughout the
investigation process. Hence following the arrest and statement recording,
the Investigating Officer should have sent the Accused immediately to the
medical doctors for examination. His failure should not be used by the
Prosecution to complaint and used for the Prosecution’s advantage.
38. Therefore, after reading the facts together with assistance of SD2’s
opinion, this Court found that reasoning given by SD2 is accepted as
being credible and inherently probable.

H

[29] Concerning the submission of learned DPP that the respondent was in
fact capable of knowing what she was doing was either wrong or contrary to
the law at the time of the commission of the offence since the respondent had
tried to cover her wrongdoing by eliminating the evidence at the scene, the
learned trial judge observed at pp. 30-31 as follows:

I

40. On the issue that the Accused had hidden the knife (photo as in
P39(28)) in the bag (photo as in P39(27)) near the entrance (photos as in
P39(25) and P39(26)) and the mattress, blanket, pillows in the black plastic
bag at the living room (photo as in P39(29)), the Court found all these
were purely assumptions made by the Prosecution without any evidence.



342

Current Law Journal

[2019] 6 CLJ

41. Furthermore, the mop inside the pail was not sufficient to establish
that it was the Accused had used it to clean the scene since there were
blood traces still remained there. The scene could have been totally
cleaned if the culprit intended to wash away the evidence since there was
evidence that the Accused was left alone when everybody had left for the
hospital.
42. The averment about six knives were hidden under mattress (photos
in P39(43) – (53)) in PW1’s room was unsustainable since the Prosecution
had not tendered proof to confirm that it was the conduct of the Accused.
43. I am mindful, if the above-mentioned acts had actually been carried
out by the Accused, it was the state of mind of the Accused after the
incident and not during the time of the commission of the offence.
Therefore, it is still relevant for the purpose of determining what was the
state of mind of the accused at the time of the commission of the offence.
44. More importantly, this Court had taken into account that the Accused
could have fled away from the scene since she was left alone in the house
after the incident if the Accused knew what she was doing was contrary
to law. No one can stop or hinder the Accused from running away since
she was left alone in the house at that significant time.
45. Pursuant to the above, it can be readily decided that the Accused truly
did not understand the nature of her act at the time of killing the
deceased.

[30] This court notes that at the very first opportunity, the respondent
already raised the defence of insanity and remained steadfast that she was
deprived of intelligence at the time of commission of the offence. Therefore,
the respondent’s defence of insanity was not a mere afterthought.
[31] That, however, it is not the end of the matter. Learned DPP submitted
that it was clear from the evidence adduced that it was the respondent who
voluntarily consumed the ecstasy pills in large quantity. Self-induced ecstasy
pills is not a defence under the law.
[32] It is trite that the absence of the legally relevant capacities due to
voluntary intoxication from alcohol or drugs is not considered as basis for
insanity defence as stated in s. 85(ii)(a) of the PC (See PP v. Mohd Nor Riza
Mat Tahar [2009] 4 CLJ 691). It can only be considered as a basis for a
defence when substance had been administered to the accused involuntarily.
The underlying moral and legal principle for this exception is the premise
that an insane should only be excused from punishment because of his or her
lack of control over the presence of the mental illness and because the mental
illness was brought on due to external circumstances. Thus, individuals who
“voluntarily” take substance leading to the deprivation of relevant capacities
should be held responsible for their actions. However, mental illness which
are the direct effect of psychoactive substances such as ecstasy are considered
as a basis for insanity defence under the law.

PP v. Pham Ti Tuyet Mai

[33] Before departing with this instant appeal, we must emphasise that the
granting of absolution of criminal liability on the basis of insanity should be
done with utmost care and circumspection as the court must keep its guard
against murderers seeking to escape punishment through a plea of insanity.
The case at hand, however, does not indicate that the defence of insanity was
merely used as a convenient tool to evade culpability.
Conclusion

C

[34] We are satisfied that the learned trial judge had made the correct
decision based on the applicable law and the evidence adduced before him
in acquitting the respondent on the ground of insanity, and in making the
order under s. 348(1) of the CPC.
[35] Consequently, the PP’s appeal is dismissed and the decision of the
learned trial judge is affirmed. So ordered.
