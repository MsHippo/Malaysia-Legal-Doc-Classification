The Prosecution’s Case
[5]

Based on the evidence adduced by the prosecution, a police team
headed by SP6 on 8 September 2014 on or about 2.25pm raided
a house situated at 727, Jarak Atas, 13300 Tasek Gelugor,

5



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

Penang (“Premises”). The Premises is owned by the father of
SP9 who lives there together with three other family members.
[6]

Upon arrival at the Premises, SP6 and his team arrested the
Accused outside a shed within the vicinity of the Premises.
During the course of the arrest, the Accused attempted to escape
but was successfully captured.

[7]

On arrest of the Accused, SP6 conducted a body check on him
but found nothing incriminating. Subsequently SP6 seized two
Nokia mobile phones from the Accused.

[8]

SP6 and his team then brought the Accused to the shed and
searched the shed. He found a first aid kit in one of the drawers
of the table situated in the shed. Upon opening the first aid kit,
SP6 found two plastic packets of crystalline substances
suspected to be Methamphetamine and two plastic packets of
compacted dry leaves suspected to be Cannabis (exhibit P4 (118) photographs 3 and 4). He further seized several other things
including a metal container labelled “Fernando Torres”, a blue
Aladdin lighter, a small plastic packet of crystalline substances
(exhibit P4 (1-18) photographs 17 and 18) and a straw. He also
seized a pair of cream coloured Levi’s jeans trousers, a KSWISS black sweater, a Nagata red weighing scale and a
Kickapoo bottle modified for smoking drugs.

[9]

Subsequently, SP6 arrested SP9 who was seen near the shed.
Upon the arrest of SP9, SP6 also conducted a body check on him
but did not find anything incriminating too. At about 4.00pm,
SP1 on the instruction of SP10 took photographs of the case
materials, shed and vicinity of the Premises (exhibit P3 (1-22)).

[10] Both the Accused and SP9 were thereafter at about 8.00pm
brought to the Narcotics Crime Investigation Department of the

6



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

IPD Seberang Perai Tengah. SP6 surrendered the Accused and
SP9 as well as handed over the case materials that were seized
to SP10. Subsequently SP6 prepared the search list (exhibit P39)
and the hand over list (exhibit P40). He also lodged Tasek
Gelugor police report no. 002415/14 (exhibit P37). In the
meantime, SP10 marked the case materials. At about 11.00pm,
SP1 again on the instruction of SP10 took photographs of the
case materials (exhibit P4 (1-18)) in the IPD Seberang Perai
Tengah.
[11] On 10 September 2014, SP10 handed over four packages of the
case materials seized by SP6 that were marked as AT1, AT2,
AT3 and AT4 to SP4 for testing and analysis. SP4 duly
registered the case materials under laboratory no. 14-FR-P06592 and issued an acknowledgment of receipt of them (exhibit
P18).
[12] The suspected drugs were contained in the aforesaid packages
AT1 and AT2. In package AT1, there were two plastic packets
of crystalline substances and two packets of dry leaves
suspected to be Methamphetamine and Cannabis respectively.
As for package AT2, there was a packet of crystalline
substances suspected to be Methamphetamine too.
[13] SP4 duly carried out the testing and analysis on the suspected
drugs as well as the other case materials that were handed to her
by SP10. In SP4’s chemist report dated 4 August 2015 after
testing and analysis, she confirmed that the two packets of
crystalline substances and two packets of dry leaves (exhibit P4
(1-18) photographs 3 and 4) from package AT1 contained nett
weight of 331.2 grams (224.1 grams + 107.1 grams) of
Methamphetamine and 3.41 grams of Cannabis respectively. The
packet of crystalline substances from package AT2 (exhibit P4

7



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

(1-18) photographs 17 and 18) contained 0.04 grams of
Methamphetamine. These are dangerous drugs as listed/defined
in the First Schedule and s. 2 of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952
(“Act”).
SP4 also found traces of Methamphetamine on the weighing
scale contained in package AT3.
[14] SP4 then on 5 August returned all the case materials to SP10
who thereafter kept them in the store at the IPD Seberang Perai
Tengah under the care of SP3 until production in Court as and
when required for the trial.
[15] In addition on 19 September 2014, Inspector Juhaida Abd.
Rahman handed to SP5 the case materials contained in packages
AT5, AT6 and AT7 and two Hospital Kepala Batas plastic tubes
containing blood samples marked 1 and 2 for DNA testing and
analysis. SP5 duly registered them under laboratory no. 14-FRP-06687 and issued an acknowledgement of receipt of them
(exhibit P30).
[16] SP5 thereafter duly carried out the testing and analysis. As the
result, she positively identified the DNA of the Accused on the
jeans trousers and towel contained in package AT7 and the
sweater in package AT6 in her chemist report dated 4 November
2014. She returned the case materials to SP10 on 12 January
2015 who thereafter kept them in the store at the IPD Seberang
Perai Tengah under the care of SP2 until production in Court as
and when required for the trial.
[17] Consequently, the prosecution submitted it has firstly proved
that the drugs that were seized by SP6 from the shed in the
vicinity of the Premises is 331.24 grams of Methamphetamine as
affirmatively tested and analysed by SP4 who is a qualified

chemist. In this respect, reliance is made on the Supreme Court
case of Munusamy v. PP [1987] 1 MLJ 492 as well as the Court
of Appeal case of Tarmizi bin Yaacob dan satu lagi v. Pendakwa
Raya [2006] 6 MLJ 197 and Adhy Tedjajadi v. PP Criminal
Appeal no. P-05-67-03/2014 (unreported).
In addition, the prosecution submitted that there is no break in
the chain of evidence whatsoever on the movement from the
time the drugs were seized, tested and analyzed till production
in Court as handled by SP6, SP10 and SP4 following the Federal
Court case of Su Ah Ping v. Public Prosecutor [1980] 1 MLJ 75
as well as the Court of Appeal cases of Gunalan Ramachandran
& Ors v. PP [2004] 4 CLJ 551 and Mazlan bin Mustaffa v. PP
Rayuan Jenayah P-05-212-08/2012 (unreported).
[18] The prosecution further submitted that the drugs that were
seized by SP6 were in the possession and full knowledge of the
Accused. In this respect, the prosecution relied on the
presumption in s. 37(d) of the Act as interpreted by the Court of
Appeal in Jonaidi Mansor v. PP [2002] 1 CLJ 730. The
aforesaid provision in the Act reads as follows:
“37. Presumptions
In all proceedings under this Act or any regulation made
thereunder...
(d) any person who is found to have had in his custody or
under his control anything whatsoever containing any
dangerous drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be
deemed to have been in possession of such drug and shall,

9



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

until the contrary is proved, be deemed to have known the
nature of such drug;
...”
[19] As to custody and control of the suspected drugs, the
prosecution contended that the Accused is the owner of the shed
as testified by SP9 where the drugs were discovered. The
Accused built the shed to carry out scrap metal business about 4
months before the raid by SP6 and his team. In addition, the
clothing and towel of the Accused were found in the shed on
that day of the raid based on the traces of DNA of the Accused
on the seized clothing and towel as tested and analysed by SP5.
Thus according to the prosecution, the Accused was not merely
present at the shed but an occupier thereto at the material time
based on the presumption in s. 37(b) of the Act that reads:
“37. Presumptions
In all proceedings under this Act or any regulation made
thereunder...
(b) a person, until the contrary is proved, shall be deemed
to be the occupier of any premises, if he has, or appears to
have, the care or management of such premises;
...”
as well as the Court of Appeal case of Wong Hong v. Pendakwa
Raya [2013] 1 LNS 489. Furthermore the Accused was
proximate to the drugs found in the shed and the prosecution
referred to the Court of Appeal case of Mazlani Mansor & Ors

10



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

v. PP [2013] 1 LNS 1292 where possession of the drugs were
affirmatively found by the Court therein.
[20] As to knowledge, the prosecution contended that the Accused
knew of the presence of the drugs in the shed by his attempted
escape upon the arrival of SP6’s raiding team as well as having
requested SP6 to search the Premises instead before the shed is
searched because the Accused alleged that he lived in the
Premises. The Accused also looked shocked and nervous upon
arrest by SP6. In this regard, reliance is made on s. 8 of the
Evidence Act 1950 on conduct as interpreted by the Federal
Court in Samundee Devan a/l Muthu Kerishnan v. Public
Prosecutor [2010] 2 MLJ 607 and Khairuddin bin Hassan v. PP
[2010] 7 CLJ 129 as well as the Court of Appeal case of Public
Prosecutor v. Tan Kim Piow [2006] 5 MLJ 409.
The prosecution thus submitted notwithstanding that the
Accused looked calm after he was arrested as testified by SP6,
he is nonetheless not exonerated of his guilt when the evidence
is considered in totality following the Federal Court case of
Ibrahim Mohamad & Anor v. PP [2011] 4 CLJ 113 and the Court
of Appeal case of Francis Abuchi Odike v. PP [2015] 1 LNS
928.
[21] Moreover the prosecution contended that the Accused admitted
to the knowledge of the suspected drugs that were seized by his
counsel putting to SP10 under cross examination that the drugs
belonged to a person in the name of Arun. Consequently, the
prosecution relied on s. 18 of the Evidence Act 1950 as
interpreted in Public Prosecutor v. Dato’ Seri Anwar bin
Ibrahim (No. 3) [1999] 2 MLJ 1.

11



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

[22] Accordingly, the prosecution submitted that the Accused
trafficked the suspected drugs based on the nett weight of the
drugs following s. 37 (da)(xvi) of the Act that reads:
“37. Presumptions
In all proceedings under this Act or any regulation made
thereunder...
(da) any person who is found in possession of...
(xvi) 50 grammes or more in weight of Methamphetamine;
...”
The prosecution also referred to the case of PP v. Mohd Farid
bin Mohd Sukis & Anor [2002] 8 CLJ 814 that the Accused must
be deemed to be trafficking in the drugs by the quantity of the
drugs involved.
[23] In the circumstances, the prosecution submitted that a prima
facie case has been made out against the Accused as charged.
Defence’s Reply
[24] The defence made it clear during clarification that the identity
and weight as well as the chain of evidence of the movement of
the drugs are not challenged.
[25] The principal challenge of the defence at this stage of the case is
that the prosecution failed to prove that the Accused was in

12



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

possession of the drugs at the material time when the drugs were
found in the shed by SP6.
[26] Firstly the defence submitted that the drugs were found in the
shed that is accessible to everyone. The shed was in an open
space that was neither walled/fenced nor locked. SP9 also
conceded that anyone could have access to the shed. In the
premises, the defence contended following the Court of Appeal
cases of Azizan Yahya v. PP [2012] 8 CLJ 405, Mohamad Abdul
Rahman v. PP [2013] 7 CLJ 843 and PP v. Mohd Sairi Abdul
Samat [2013] 10 CLJ 30 that the Accused therefore did not have
custody, control and possession of the drugs at all material
times.
[27] Furthermore the defence contended that the Accused never had
care, management and control of the Premises which is
inextricably connected with shed. There were four occupants in
the Premises which included SP9. The electrical supply to the
shed is tapped from the Premises. It is not a disputed fact that
the Accused did not permanently reside in the Premises but
elsewhere. He lived at 235, Lorong 7/3, Taman Makmur 09600
Kulim Kedah. He merely used the shed to operate his scrap
metal business as acknowledged by SP6 and SP9. Hence the
defence submitted that occupants of the Premises had access to
the shed and could have kept the drugs there when they were
found by SP6.
[28] The defence also contended that proximity of the Accused to the
drugs upon arrest itself does not prove his knowledge of the
presence of the drugs in the shed following PP v. Mohd Nizam
Abdul Kassim & Anor [2016] 1 CLJ 1046.
[29] Thus as to knowledge of the presence of the suspected drugs, it
is the defence’s submission that the prosecution has to rely on
13



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

the conduct of the Accused in attempt to escape to impute that
knowledge upon him. There is otherwise no other cogent
evidence to link him with the drugs. The defence however
contended that SP6’s testimony is unreliable because he gave
conflicting versions on the crucial fact of how he arrested the
Accused. There is ambiguity as to whether the Accused was
captured in the shed or whilst he was running in attempt to
escape. In this regard, the defence relied on the case of Public
Prosecutor v. Lee Eng Kooi [1993] 2 MLJ 332 as well as the
later Federal Court case of Lee Ah Seng & Anor v. PP [2007] 5
CLJ 1 where the Court found no reliable and trustworthy
evidence to convict the accused when the prosecution led two
versions of evidence.
[30] According to the defence, it is plain from the Supreme Court
case of Gooi Loo Seng v. Public Prosecutor [1993] 2 MLJ 137
that even if the Accused had knowledge of presence of the
drugs, that by itself would not have been sufficient to establish
that he was in possession or in control of the drugs if others had
access to the shed. In addition, the prosecution failed to adduce
other cogent corroborative evidence to establish knowledge on
the part of the Accused such as finger-print dusting or identity
of the owner of the mobile phone that was found together with
the drugs in the drawer of the table in the shed. In this respect,
the defence relied on the Supreme Court case of Public
Prosecutor v. Lim Lian Chen [1992] 1 MLJ 561 as well as the
case of Public Prosecutor v. Majiddi bin Abdul Majid [2003] 5
MLJ 76 on the former and the the Court of Appeal case of
Hussin Mohamad v. PP & Another Appeal [2016] 10 CLJ 59 on
the latter to exonerate the Accused.
[31] The defence finally contended that the reliance on s. 18 of the
Evidence Act 1950 by the prosecution is misconceived because
14



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

the provision is inapplicable to illustrate the Accused knew of
the presence of the drugs. It must be construed merely as a
suggestion by counsel in discharge of the obligation to put the
defence case to the prosecution’s witnesses following the
Federal Court case of Wong Swee Chin v. Public Prosecutor
[1981] 1 MLJ 212 that the drugs belonged to Arun and nothing
more.
[32] Consequently, the defence submitted that the prosecution has
failed to establish a prima facie case against the Accused who
must accordingly be acquitted and discharged without his
defence called.
Findings of the Court at the Close of the Prosecution’s case
[33] At the close of the prosecution’s case, my duty and
responsibilities are that as set out in s. 180 of the Criminal
Procedure Code which states:
“180. Procedure after conclusion of case for prosecution
(1) When the case for the prosecution is concluded, the
Court shall consider whether the prosecution has made out
a prima facie case against the accused.
(2) If the Court finds that the prosecution has not made out
a prima facie case against the accused, the Court shall
record an order of acquittal.
(3) If the Court finds that a prima facie case has been
made out against the accused on the offence charged the
Court shall call upon the accused to enter on his defence.

15



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

(4) For the purpose of this section, a prima facie case is
made out against the accused where the prosecution has
adduced credible evidence proving each ingredient of the
offence which if unrebutted or unexplained would warrant
a conviction.”
[34] Augustine Paul JCA (later FCJ) explained prima facie case as
follows in the Federal Court case of Balachandran v. Public
Prosecutor [2005] 1 AMR 321:
“A prima facie case is therefore one that is sufficient for
the accused to be called upon to answer. This in turn
means that the evidence adduced must be such that it can
only be overthrown by evidence in rebuttal...The result is
that the force of the evidence adduced must be such that, if
unrebutted, it is sufficient to induce the court to believe in
the existence of the facts stated in the charge or to
consider its existence so probable that a prudent man
ought to act upon the supposition that those facts exist or
did happen. On the other hand if a prima facie case has
not been made out it means that there is no material
evidence which can be believed in the sense as described
earlier. In order to make a finding either way the court
must, at the close of the case for the prosecution,
undertake a positive evaluation of the credibility and
reliability of all the evidence adduced so as to determine
whether the elements of the offence have been established.
As the trial is without a jury it is only with such a positive
evaluation can the court make a determination for the
purpose of s. 180(2) and (3). Of course in a jury trial
where the evaluation is hypothetical the question to be
asked would be whether on the evidence as it stands the
accused could (and not must) lawfully be convicted. That
16



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

is so because a determination on facts is a matter for
ultimate decision by the jury at the end of the trial. Since
the court, in ruling that a prima facie case has been made
out, must be satisfied that the evidence adduced can be
overthrown only by evidence in rebuttal it follows that if it
is not rebutted it must prevail. Thus if the accused elects
to remain silent he must be convicted. The test at the close
of the case for the prosecution would therefore be: Is the
evidence sufficient to convict the accused if he elects to
remain silent? If the answer is in the affirmative then a
prima facie case has been made out. This must, as of
necessity, require a consideration of the existence of any
reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution. If there
is any such doubt there can be no prima facie case.”
Furthermore in the subsequent Federal Court case of Public
Prosecutor v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar [2005] 6 AMR 203, Gopal
Sri Ram JCA (later FCJ) held as follows:
“8. For the guidance of the courts below, we summarise
as follows the steps that should be taken by a trial court at
the close of the prosecution’s case:
(i)
the close of the prosecution’s case, subject the
evidence led by the prosecution in its totality to a
maximum evaluation. Carefully scrutinise the credibility of
each of the prosecution’s witnesses. Take into account all
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that
evidence. If the evidence admits of two or more inferences,
then draw the inference that is most favourable to the
accused;
(ii) ask yourself the question: If I now call upon the
accused to make his defence and he elects to remain silent
17



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

am I prepared to convict him on the evidence now before
me? If the answer to that question is ‘Yes’, then a prima
facie case has been made out and the defence should be
called. If the answer is ‘No’ then, a prima facie case has
not been made out and the accused should be acquitted;
(iii) after the defence is called, the accused elects to
remain silent, then convict;
(iv) after defence is called, the accused elects to give
evidence, then go through the steps set out in Mat v.
Public Prosecutor [1963] MLJ 263.”
[35] Consequently, I am required to conduct a maximum evaluation
test on the prosecution’s evidence here including the assessment
of the credibility of witnesses called by the prosecution and
drawing inferences admitted by the prosecution. If the
prosecution’s evidence admitted two or more inferences, the one
that is more favourable to the defence is generally to be
accepted unless the silent or circumstantial evidence otherwise
discloses a compelling inference that points to the guilt of the
accused.
[36] Accordingly in Pendakwa Raya v. Kua Tiong Ann [2009] 7 AMR
788, Vernon Ong Lam Kiat JC (now JCA) held that it is
necessary for the prosecution to prove the following ingredients
to secure the conviction of an accused person in respect of a
charge pursuant to s. 39B of the Act:
(i.)

The drugs involved must be a dangerous drug as listed in
the First Schedule of the Act;

(ii.) The drugs were in his possession; and
(iii.) He was trafficking in the drugs.
18



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

All three ingredients that constituted the offence must be proved
by the prosecution seriatim. Otherwise, a prima facie case is not
made out.
[37] I will deal with each of the ingredients of the offence
sequentially based on the totality of the evidence adduced
including the credibility of the witnesses and the submissions
that were canvassed before me.
[38] As to the first ingredient of the offence on the identity of the
drugs, I noted that the defence did not challenge the same as
pointed out by the prosecution. That notwithstanding, I am
satisfied from the evidence led by the prosecution that the drugs
seized from the shed are Methamphetamine that weighed 331.24
grams from SP4’s testimony. In addition, she confirmed that the
drugs are dangerous drugs within the stipulations in the Act.
[39] Furthermore, I am satisfied that there is no break in the
evidential chain of movement of the drugs right from the seizure
in the shed until production in Court based on the collective
testimony of SP6, SP3, SP4 and SP10.
[40] In the premises, I find and hold that the prosecution has proved
the first ingredient of the offence under maximum evaluation.
[41] Moving on to the second ingredient of the offence on
possession, I noted that the prosecution relied on s. 37(d) of the
Act. It is not in dispute that the Accused was in the shed when
the raid led by SP6 was about to take place in the afternoon of 8
September 2014 at the Premises. However the prosecution must
prove that the Accused had custody or in his control the first aid
kit and a small plastic packet that contained the drugs found in
the drawer of the table in the shed. From the photographs in
exhibit P3 (1-22), it is seen that the drawers of the table were

19



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

not locked. The first aid kit was also not locked. In the Court of
Appeal case of Mazlani Mansor & Ors v. PP (supra), Clement
Skinner JCA held as follows with emphasis added by me:
“[27] In Chan Pean Leon v. PP [1956] 1 LNS 17; [1956]
22 MLJ 237 Thomson J dealt with the issue of possession
by quoting this passage from Stephen’s Digest 9 th Edition
page 304 where the word “possession” as regards the
criminal law is described as:
“A movable thing is said to be in the possession of a
person when he is so situated with respect to it that he
has the power to deal with it as owner to the exclusion of
all other persons, and when the circumstances are such
that he may be presumed to intend to do so in case of
need.”
Thomson J went on to say:
“Intention is a matter of fact which in the nature of
things cannot be proved by direct evidence. It can only be
proved from the surrounding circumstances. Whether
these surrounding circumstances make out such intention
is a question of fact in each individual case.”
[28] Reverting to the facts of this case, what were the
circumstances surrounding the recovery of the cannabis in
the house? As the learned Judge found, this was a case
where at a very late hour of the night, behind the locked
doors of the house which the police had to forcibly kick
open to gain entry into, the 3 Appellants were found in the
presence of a very large quantity of cannabis, some of
which were in plastic bags and some of which were in
sugar sacks. In our judgment the correct irresistible

20



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

inference to be drawn from the circumstances just
mentioned is that the 3 Appellants were so situated to the
cannabis that they had the power to deal with the drugs as
owners to the exclusion of all other persons and intended
to do so in case of need.
[29] As regards the Appellants denial of knowledge of
what was in the plastic bags and the sacks, as the contents
were not visible to the naked eye, we find this factor
should not be given too much weight. As was said by the
Singapore Court of Appeal in Zulfikar Bin Mustaffah v. PP
[2001] 1 SLR 633 at p 639 (which was referred to with
approval by our Federal Court in PP v. Abdul Rahman
Akif [2007] 4 CLJ 337) such assertions should not be
given too much weight. Otherwise drug peddlers could
escape liability simply by ensuring that any drugs coming
into their possession are first securely sealed in opaque
wrappings. In our view the circumstances just mentioned
by us show that the Appellants’ claimed ignorance of the
drugs in the plastic bags and sacks is not credible.
[30] With regard to the absence of the Appellants’ finger
prints on the incriminating items, we find that not much
weight can be attached to such evidence either because in
criminal law, a person may still be in possession of a
movable thing without actually being in physical contact
with it. What is required is that he is so situated with
respect to it that he has the power to deal with it as owner
to the exclusion of all other persons which, as we found
earlier, is the case here.”
[42] From my literal reading of s. 37(d) of the Act, the Accused is
deemed to know nature of the drugs but not the presence or

21



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

existence of the drugs. The Prosecution contended that
knowledge is generally presumed and relied on the Court of
Appeal cases of Jonaidi Mansor v. PP (supra) and Ali
Hosseinzadeh Basher v. Public Prosecutor Criminal Appeal no.
B-05-36-211 (Iran) (unreported).
In the former case, Gopal Sri Ram JCA (later FCJ) held as
follows with emphasis added by me:
“There are passages in his judgment which suggest that it
is for an accused to show on a balance of probabilities
that he did not have custody of the prescribed drug under
s. 37(d). Counsel for the appellant submitted that this was
an erroneous statement of the law and cited a helpful
passage in the judgment of Visu Sinnadurai J in PP v. Tan
Tuan Seng [1993] 2 CLJ 557, where he said:
Section 37(d) is applicable whenever a person is found to
have in his custody or control anything containing
dangerous drugs. This section envisages by the use of the
word ‘anything’ that the drugs were contained in a
container or receptacle. Once it is established by the
prosecution that the accused had in his custody or control
the container containing the drugs, the accused is deemed
to be in control of the drugs. In such a case, there is no
need for the prosecution to go any further to prove
knowledge of the drugs on the part of the accused. Though
knowledge is an essential ingredient of the offence of
possession, the need to establish knowledge as a separate
ingredient is dispensed with by the fact that the
prosecution by establishing custody or control has
activated the presumption of possession. Implicit in the
accused having knowledge, is that the element of

22



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

knowledge of the drugs by the accused is also presumed,
for without knowledge (presumed) there cannot be
possession. In other words, once the presumption has been
activated, the accused is deemed to have possession, and
as he is deemed to have possession, he is also deemed to
have knowledge: see however the views of Wilson J in
Choo Teck Soon v. PP [1954] MLJ 63 where a different
approach was taken as the wording in the then legislation
was different.
It is sometimes said that knowledge, in such
circumstances is presumed under the last limb of s. 37(d),
that is, by the words ‘he is deemed to have known the
nature of the drugs’. This appears to be a misinterpretation of the section as these words merely
dispense with the need for the prosecution to establish
that the accused knew the exact nature or quality of the
drugs: see Lockyer v. Gibb[1966] 2 All ER 653 at p. 656
CA and as explained in Warner v. Metropolitan Police
Commissioner [1968] 2 All ER 356 HL. It should be noted
that it is for this reason that the last limb of s. 37(d) does
not provide by saying that the accused is also deemed to
have knowledge of the drugs. To do so would have been
superfluous, since the accused is already deemed to have
possession, which of course must mean that he is
presumed to have knowledge.
We are in agreement with the interpretation of s. 37(d)
given it by Visu Sinnadurai J...”
Subsequently in the latter case, Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA
however held as follows:

23



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

“Even assuming it is true that Ashgar does exist and that
he did asked the appellant to carry the bag to Malaysia,
the question for the trial court to consider was whether the
accused had knowledge of the drugs. To prove trafficking,
knowledge must of course be established but that is a
matter for the appellant to disprove by virtue of section
37(d) of the DDA and not for the prosecution to
established at the closed of its case once custody and
control had been established...”
[43] In the Federal Court case of Ibrahim Mohamad & Anor v. PP
[2011] 4 CLJ 113 Zulkefli Makinuddin FCJ (now PCA) however
held as follows:
“The law is well settled that having only custody or
control over the said drugs is insufficient to establish
‘possession’. The physical act or custody must be
accompanied with evidence that the accused had
knowledge of the said drugs. In the absence of any
statutory presumption, knowledge has to be proved either
by direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. Mere
knowledge alone without exclusivity of either physical
custody or control or both is insufficient in law to
constitute possession, let alone trafficking.”
[44] It therefore seems to me that knowledge of the presence or
existence of the drugs has to be proved as part and parcel of
proof of custody and/or control of the drugs. The prosecution
must prove knowledge of the presence of the drugs on the part
of the Accused notwithstanding that specific reliance is made on
s. 37(d) of the Act.

24



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

Consequently it is seen in Public Prosecutor v. Abdul Rahman
bin Akif (supra) that Arifin Zakaria FCJ (later CJ) held as
follows with emphasis added by me:
“[22] Reverting to the present case, it is therefore
incumbent upon the court to scrutinize the entire evidence
before the court to see whether an inference can be drawn
against the respondent that he knew about the drug in the
three packages found in the car. It is not in dispute that
the three packages were found hidden in the car under the
driver’s seat and under the front passenger’s seat. He was
alone in the car at the material time. One other important
factor of relevance is that the car had been in his
possession for the past seven months prior to his arrest.
[23] It is true that the trial judge did not make any
finding on the issue of knowledge necessary to establish
possession of the drugs, as he relied on the cautioned
statement in coming to his finding. The Court of Appeal
on the facts correctly found that there was sufficient
evidence to find the respondent to be in custody and
control of the three packages found in the car and relying
on the presumption under s. 37(d) of the Act the Court of
Appeal went on to hold that the respondent was in
presumed possession of the drug.
[24] Applying the observations set out in the authorities
cited above to the facts in the present case, the
irresistible inference that may be drawn in the
circumstances is that the respondent all along knew
about the drug found in the car. The fact that they were
found hidden under the seats of the car and wrapped in
Chinese newspaper would not assist him to negate such an

25



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

inference. From the evidence of PW5 it is clear that little
effort was required to uncover what was contained in the
three packages. Therefore, we are of the view that on the
facts and in the circumstances of this case the learned
trial judge, properly directed on the law, would have
come to the finding that prima facie the respondent had
possession of the drug independent of the statutory
presumption under s. 37(d) of the Act.”
[45] Accordingly, custody and/or control of the drugs involves both
the ability to physically deal with them to the exclusion of
others as well as having knowledge of their presence or
existence. They must both be established, otherwise custody or
control of the drugs is not proved.
[46] From the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the drugs
in the shed herein, I am satisfied that the Accused had the power
to deal with the things in the unlocked drawer of the table in the
shed including the first aid kit and the contents therein to the
exclusion of other persons at the material time. The drugs were
contained in packets in the first aid kit as well as in another
packet outside the first aid kit, all of which were in that drawer.
[47] As to proof of knowledge, Augustine Paul FCJ held as follows
in the Federal Court case of Palan Dadeh v. PP [2009] 1 CLJ
717 with emphasis added by me:
“As I said in PP v. Hoo Chee Keong [1997] 2 CLJ SUPP
357; [1997] 4 MLJ 451 at p 459:
Proof of knowledge is very often a matter of inference.
Thean J (as he then was) in elaborating on the matter of
inferring knowledge said in PP v. Phua Keng Tong & 2

26



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

Other Appeals [1986] 1 LNS 129; [1986] 2 MLJ 279 at p
286:
However, in this case, like in many others, proof of
knowledge or belief on the part of an accused is a matter
of inference from facts. In the case of RCA Corp v. Custom
Cleared Sales Pty Ltd [1978] FSR 576; 19 ALR 123, the
Court of Appeal in New South Wales in dealing with the
question of knowledge of infringement of copyright said at
p 478:
Except where a party’s own statements or gestures are
relied upon, proof of knowledge is always a matter of
inference, and the material from which the inference of
the existence of actual knowledge can be inferred varies
infinitely from case to case.
And the court further said, at p 579:
It seems to us that the principle is more accurately put by
saying that a court is entitled to infer knowledge on the
part of a particular person on the assumption that such a
person has the ordinary understanding expected of persons
in his line of business, unless by his or other evidence it is
convinced otherwise. In other words, the true position is
that the court is not concerned with the knowledge of a
reasonable man but is concerned with reasonable
inferences to be drawn from a concrete situation as
disclosed in the evidence as it affects the particular person
whose knowledge is in issue. In inferring knowledge, a
court is entitled to approach the matter in two stages;
where opportunities for knowledge on the part of the
particular person are proved and there is nothing to
indicate that there are obstacles to the particular person
27



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

acquiring the relevant knowledge, there is some evidence
from which the court can conclude that such person has
knowledge.
It is therefore clear that knowledge can be proved by
drawing inferences from surrounding circumstances.”
[48] Put simply, knowledge on the part of an accused person such as
the presence of drugs is fact sensitive depending on the peculiar
facts and circumstances of each case.
[49] Again on the facts of the case herein, I am satisfied that the
Accused was proximate to the drugs because he was in the shed
at the material time. However proof of proximity alone is
inadequate. In the Court of Appeal case of Romi Amora Amir v.
PP [2011] 1 CLJ 870, Suriyadi Halim Omar JCA (later FCJ)
held as follows:
“Unless knowledge is proved, an item however close to a
person, could just be miles away.”
Likewise, Collin Lawrence Sequerah JC (now J) held as follows
in PP v. Mohd Nizam Abdul Kassim & Anor [2016] 1 CLJ 1046:
“[52] It is therefore clear that mere proximity or
juxtaposition of the second accused to the drugs without
more is insufficient to fasten possession upon him.”
[50] In my opinion, knowledge may be imputed upon the Accused
through methodical elimination reasoning process based on
circumstantial evidence as existed. The Accused managed the
shed to carry out his scrap metal business. Hence if the drugs
were found exposed or visible on the table proximate to the
Accused, it can safely be said that he had knowledge of the
presence of the drugs. This is however not the case here. The
28



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

drugs were concealed in the drawer of the table. It may still be
inferred that the Accused had knowledge of the drugs if the
drawers were locked and he had the keys to open them. This is
neither the case here too. The drawers were not locked. In this
case, it may nonetheless be reasonably inferred that the Accused
had the knowledge if only he had exclusive access to the shed.
Otherwise, there must be other connecting proof such as finger
prints or DNA traces of the Accused found on the packet(s)
containing the drugs or that the other surrounding evidence
plainly pointed to the Accused having knowledge of the existent
of the Drugs.
[51] The cases on exclusive possession, or more accurately in my
opinion exclusive access, to the exclusion of others of the drugs
found are aplenty. They include Gooi Loo Seng v. Public
Prosecutor (supra), Saludin bin Surif v. Public Prosecutor
[1997] 3 MLJ 317, Roslan Abdullah v. PP [2010] 1 CLJ 685, PP
v. Mazlan Mustaffa [2011] 1 CLJ 964, Muhammad Nazir bin
Jamaludin v. Pendakwa Raya [2011] 2 MLJ 311, Azizan Yahya
v. PP (supra), Mohamad Abdul Rahman v. PP (supra), PP v.
Mohd Sairi Abdul Samat (supra) and PP v. Ahmad Nashiri Abdul
Razak [2014] 7 CLJ 749. Since the facts in these cases are
dissimilar to that herein, I do not think it is worthwhile to
reproduce them. It can generally be surmised that possession has
been found not to be proved when exclusive access to the drugs
by the accused persons has not been proved by the prosecution
therein. It suffices for me just to quote what was held by Balia
Yusof Wahi JCA (now FCJ) in the Court of Appeal case of
Mohammad Abdul Rahman v. PP (supra) on rather analogous
facts:
“[20] Taking into consideration the totality of the
evidence, we are of the considered view that the learned
29



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

trial judge had failed to consider that the room where the
drugs were found was accessible to others and there was
no exclusive custody and control of the drawer by the
appellant. Our perusal of the learned trial judge’s grounds
of judgment did not indicate that His Lordship had made
that consideration. In our view, that evidence is material
and that failure to consider material evidence does make
an error of law beyond argument. (Gotham Construction
Co v. Amulya Krishna Ghose And Ors AIR [1968] Cal
91).”
[52] From the evidence adduced here before me, SP9 conceded under
cross examination that the shed is accessible to anyone. The
relevant excerpts of the notes of proceedings are as follows:
“Q: Soalan saya bukan kata kamu kenal adakah kamu
tahu orang-orang yang kawan-kawan yang biasa yang
selalu datang ke bangsal tersebut. Soalan saya bukanlah
kamu kenal mereka, soalan saya di antara kawan-kawan
Linges yang datang ke bangsal itu adakah kawan-kawan

A:

Ya, ya, ya kenal.

Q:

A:

Q:

Apa nama mereka?

A:

Arun, Tamilkumar, Doc.

Q:

Dan siapa lagi?

A:

Selalu dia orang yang datang sana.
30



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

Q: Dan kamu kata ada juga pekerja-pekerja ladang juga
datang ke bangsal itu?
A:

Ya.

Q: Dan bila ditanya oleh DPP tadi kamu kata kawankawan dan pekerja-pekerja ladang ini juga pernah datang
melepak di bangsal itu, betul?
A:

Ya.

Q;

Kamu pernah nampak mereka lepak di bangsal itu?

A:

Pernah lihat.

...
Q: Tadi kamu kata bangsal itu berdekatan dengan
ladang betul?
A:

Betul.

Q:

Dan ada juga jalan daripada ladang itu ke bangsal?

A:

Ada.

...
Q: Dan setuju dengan saya bangsal ini tidak ada apaapa pagar atau pintu yang boleh dikunci siapa-siapa saja
boleh masuk?
A: Ya boleh masuk.”
[53] Thus and notwithstanding that the Accused occupied the shed, I
however find and hold that the Accused did not have exclusive
access to the shed. In the premises, it could not be safely
inferred that he had knowledge of the presence or existence of
31



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

the drugs in the drawer of the table. The drugs could have been
placed there by his friend(s) or the estate worker(s) for
safekeeping. In this respect, SP9 answered as follows under
cross examination:
“Q: Dan setuju dengan saya tanpa pengetahuan
Lingeswaran, tanpa pengetahuan kamu sendiri dadah yang
polis jumpa di dalam tempat tersebut boleh diletakkan di
situ oleh mana-mana kawan-kawan Lingeswaran atau
pekerja ladang senyap-senyap mereka letakkan di situ.
Kamu setuju dengan saya?
A: Setuju.”
[54] There is also no evidence adduced by the prosecution that finger
prints or DNA traces of the Accused were found on the packets
that contained the drugs which would otherwise be cogent
evidence to infer knowledge on his part independent of access to
them by other persons as held in the Supreme Court case of
Public Prosecutor v. Lim Lian Chen (supra).There were also no
finger prints or DNA traces of the Accused found on the Nagata
red weighing scale and Kickapoo bottle modified for smoking
drugs which were found on the table in the shed.
[55] Nevertheless, the prosecution still endeavoured to illustrate that
the Accused knew of the presence or existence of the drugs by
his conduct of attempting to escape when confronted by the
raiding team led by SP6 that afternoon. I noted that Augustine
Paul FCJ held as follows in Palan Dadeh v. PP (supra):
“[36] ... If there is no evidence to show that the conduct is
influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact as required
by s. 8 Evidence Act 1950 (‘EA’), then it is not admissible
as it would then be an equivocal act justifying inferences

32



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

favourable to the accused being drawn. If it satisfies the
requirement of section 8 EA it is admissible. The degree of
proof required to establish evidence of conduct would
depend on the nature of the conduct. Conduct like the
flight of an accused is a more positive act and is easily
established. On the other hand conduct like the accused
looking stunned, nervous, scared or frightened is very
often a matter of perception and more detailed evidence
may be required. Once admitted the court cannot resort to
any other explanation for the conduct or draw inferences
on its own accord to render it inadmissible. The onus is on
the accused to explain his conduct pursuant to s. 9 EA ...”
[56] The defence however submitted that the testimony of SP6 on
this aspect of the conduct of the Accused is equivocal and
contradictory. In this regard, SP6 gave three versions during
examination in chief itself as seen from the following excerpts
of the notes of proceedings:
“Q: OK setibanya di lokasi kejadian sila jelaskan apa
berlaku setibanya van Hi Ace ini tiba apa berlaku?
A:
Setibanya di tempat kejadian saya bersama anggota
terus membuat serbuan di sebuah bangsal.
...
Q: Apabila Inspektor nampak lelaki India ini, apa yang
lelaki India ini membuat?
A:
Pada masa itu lelaki India itu tersebut sedang

bangsal berkenaan.

A:

Q: Jadi Inspektor masuk ke dalam bangsal ke macam
mana?
A:
Ya, saya terus masuk ke dalam bangsal tersebut dan

Q: Boleh jelaskan tak kejadian masa Inspektor nampak
satu lelaki India itu, apa berlaku di situ?
A:
Baik, semasa serbuan suspek nampak saya dan
anggota dan beliau telah cuba untuk melarikan diri
dengan menuju ke arah kami sebab laluan satu sahaja
tetapi berjaya ditahan.
Q: Apa maksud Inspektor ada satu laluan sahaja? Kan
Inspektor ramai-ramai dia lari ke arah Inspektor?
A:
Ya, dia lari ke arah saya sebab pada masa tersebut
saya pada pendapat saya dia pun mungkin nampak
anggota yang berada di arah hadapan anggota Task Force
tadi so dia berlari ke sebelah tepi ini mengarah ke arah
kami pula.

I am however aware SP6 stated that he had made Tasek Gelugor
police report no. 002415/14 (exhibit P37) in the evening after
the raid which, inter alia, stated as follows:
“Suspek telah
ditahan.”

The prosecution accordingly submitted that SP6 should be
excused from the inconsistency in his testimony because there
was a long period that had since elapsed between the arrest and
the trial. In other words, SP6’s imperfect recollection should not
be faulted. Reliance is made by the prosecution on the case Pie
bin Chin v. Public Prosecutor [1985] 1 MLJ 234 and the recent

35



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

Federal Court case of Amri Ibrahim & Anor v. PP [2017] 1 CLJ
617.
[57] I have reviewed this alleged discrepancy in SP6’s testimony
very carefully as it concerned a pertinent and material point. I
am mindful that it was held by the Federal Court in Public
Prosecutor v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar (supra) that if the
evidence adduced admitted two or more versions, then the
version that is most favourable to the Accused should be
accepted. After analysing the SP6’s evidence in entirety, I find
that SP6 made an honest mistake when he originally testified
that the Accused was standing in the shed working when the raid
occurred. I therefore accept his later testimony that the Accused
fled towards SP6 when he saw the raiding team approaching
him. This is corroborated by his contemporaneous police report
made on that day.
[58] That notwithstanding, I also accept that the conduct of the
Accused fleeing is consistent with him attempting to escape
from capture because he was unlawfully operating an unlicensed
scrap metal business in the shed as so submitted by the defence.
In other words, I do not find that the adverse conduct on the part
of the Accused in fleeing from capture per se is adequate to
justify the inference that he had knowledge of the presence of
the drugs in the shed.
[59] The prosecution further attempted to show knowledge of the
presence of the drugs on the part of the Accused by his conduct
of informing SP6 upon arrest to search the Premises first instead
of the shed. The relevant excerpt of the notes of proceedings
reads as follows:
“Q: Suspek itu minta apa?

36



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

A:
Minta saya periksa rumah tersebut dahulu tapi saya
menegaskan untuk memeriksa bangsal tersebut dahulu.”
[60] I find that alleged statement of the Accused to be inadmissible
because there is no evidence of caution pursuant to s. 37A of the
Act having being prior administered by SP6 to the Accused
before the statement was uttered: see Hendra Kozama v. Public
Prosecutor [2018] MLJU 11. In any event, I do not find that the
alleged statement is suggestive of guilt or even knowledge of the
presence or existence of the drugs on the part of the Accused.
The shed is accessory to the Premises occupied by other
persons. Since there is no evidence of SP6 having told the
Accused on the purpose of the raid, it is in my opinion
reasonable in such circumstance for the Accused to have told
SP6 to first search the Premises which is the main building. I do
not find anything incriminating or suspicious that should be
inferred.
[61] The prosecution also attempted to impute knowledge of the
presence of the drugs upon the Accused because he looked
shocked and nervous upon arrest as well as there were clothing
and towel of the Accused found in the Shed as seen from his
DNA traces on them as analysed by SP5. I noticed that the
prosecution’s submission on the disposition of the Accused is
rather ambivalent because the Accused was supposedly shocked
and nervous upon but was however calm after the arrest. That is
baffling. In any event, I do not however find that the shock and
nervous reaction of the Accused per se implicated the Accused
with the Drugs too because it is also likely as submitted by the
defence that the Accused worked in the shed operating an
unlicensed scrap metal business. In Public Prosecutor v. Syed
Muhammad Faysal bin Syed Ibrahim [2004] 6 MLJ 303, VT
Singham J held as follows in respect of DNA evidence:
37



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

“Nevertheless, whole the admission of DNA evidence is
recognised in this jurisdiction, it does not speak as to a
fact but it is only an incriminating piece of evidence and
the DNA profiling establishes no more than that the
suspect could be the offender, not that he or she is the
offender. It mere tends to show or possibly link a suspect
with the crime scene or with the victim but other
circumstantial evidence in a criminal trial so as to
implicate the suspect or the person charged in court ...”
[62] Finally as to the prosecution’s proposition that the Accused
knew of the presence of the drugs when his counsel put to the
witnesses of the prosecution that the drugs belonged to Arun
during cross examination which hence constituted an admission
pursuant to s. 18 of the Evidence Act 1950, I think that this must
be seen in its proper context. Firstly it was unmistakenly put by
counsel as part of his duty pursuant to the Browne v. Dunn rule
as affirmed by the Federal Court in Wong Swee Chin v. Public
Prosecutor (supra). Secondly, the suggestion of the drugs
belonged to Arun cannot ipso facto mean that the Accused knew
of the existence of the drugs prior to his arrest. The reference to
Arun can equally be the explanation of the Accused as to who
was likely the possessor of drugs after they were found by SP6.
The bottom line in my view is that nothing incriminating can be
concluded against the Accused at this stage unless he himself
has been asked on it and his corresponding answer incriminated
him. Thirdly, the prosecution’s relied on s. 18 of the Evidence
Act in support of its proposition. The provision reads as follows:
“18. Admission by party to proceeding, his agent or
person interested

38



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

(1) Statements made by a party to the proceeding or by an
agent to any such party whom the court regards under the
circumstances of the case as expressly or impliedly
authorized by him to make them are admissions.
(2) Statements made by parties to suits, suing or sued in a
representative character, are not admissions unless they
were made while the party making them held that
character.
(3) Statements made by –
(a) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest
in the subject matter of the proceeding, and who make the
statement in their character of persons so interested; or
(b) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived
their interest in the subject matter of the suit, are
admissions if they are made during the continuance of the
interest of the persons making the statements.”
The prosecution did not tender any case authority to support its
reliance on s. 18 of the Evidence Act in analogous circumstance.
On careful reading of it, I find and hold that the reliance is
misplaced because it should apply only to admissions by parties
or persons made outside of the trial. Even if it should apply at
trial, it must necessarily be confined to admissions given by
witnesses and cannot extend to contents of questions posed by
counsel notwithstanding that counsel is an agent of the party in
trial.
[63] By reason of the prosecution’s failure to adequately prove
knowledge of the presence or existence by reason of non
exclusive access to the drugs on the part of the Accused in the

39



[2018] 1 LNS 371

Legal Network Series

circumstances, I find that he did not have custody or control of
the drugs. As the result s. 37(d) of the Act could not be invoked.
There is in fact also no actual possession of the drugs by him
without knowledge of their presence or existence and I so find
and hold accordingly. I hence find and hold that the prosecution
has failed to establish the second ingredient of possession under
maximum evaluation. It is unsafe to find and hold that the
Accused was in possession of the drugs from the evidence
adduced before me.
[64] Consequently, it is unnecessary for me to make my finding on
the third ingredient of the offence on trafficking following PP v.
Wong Moy [1988] 2 CLJ 521.
Conclusion
[65] For the foregoing reasons, I find and hold that the prosecution
has not made out a prima facie case against the Accused.
Consequently, I order that the Accused be discharged and
acquitted.
