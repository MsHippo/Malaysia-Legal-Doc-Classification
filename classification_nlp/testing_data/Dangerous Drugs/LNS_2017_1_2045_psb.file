Case for the prosecution
[3]

The prosecution called 5 witnesses to prove the charge.
According to the evidence led by the prosecution, at about 12
noon on 2 June 2014, DSP Mohd Husni bin Manaf (PW3) who
was attached to the Narcotics Unit at IPK Selangor received
information that a male Indian trafficker would be delivering
drugs in a motorcycle bearing registration number WTV 1276.
Acting on the aforesaid information, DSP Husni led a party of
10 Narcotics Officers to a Shell petrol station (“Shell station’) at
Lot Pt 4087, Bandar Baru Sg Buloh, Selangor.

[4]

The raiding team reached the Shell station at about 2.15 pm, and
split into four groups and waited in ambush. The accused was
arrested at the Shell station about 15 minutes later and a
Modenas Kriss motorcycle bearing registration number WTU
1276 was seized. There was a serious dispute on the evidence as
to the events that led to the arrest of the accused.

[5]

DSP Husni testified that whilst waiting at the Shell station, he
saw the accused riding motorcycle WTV 1276 into the station.

3



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

The accused parked his motorcycle near the exit and took a
white plastic bag (exhibit P10) from the carrier, and proceeded
to walk towards a car park in the adjacent property. The police
moved in and arrested him and seized the white plastic bag that
he was carrying in his right hand.
[6]

Inside the white plastic bag was a blue plastic bag (exhibit P11)
that contained 3 slabs of compressed dried leaves (exhibit P14)
wrapped in clear plastic paper. The accused was searched and no
incriminating items were found on him. The police then
proceeded to seize the motorcycle, the motorcycle keys, a
handphone (exhibit P18) and a crash helmet (exhibit P17). The
items seized and the accused were taken to the Narcotics Unit at
the Sg Buloh police station, where DSP Husni labelled the items
and prepared a search list. At about 5 pm, DSP Husni handed the
items seized and the accused to the Investigating Officer,
Inspector Muhamad Izhar (“Investigating Officer”) (PW5).

[7]

The main thrust of the cross-examination of DSP Husni was
aimed at establishing that he was mistaken as to the identity of
the person who had rode the motorcycle into the Shell station. It
was put to DSP Husni that the person who rode the motorcycyle
into the Shell station was one Abdul Karim bin Hussin
(“Karim”) (PW2), the owner of the motorcycle. It was further
put to him that the accused had come to the Shell station to meet
Karim for lunch. He had driven there in his motor lorry WHS
9029 which he had parked on the grass verge just before the
entrance to the Shell station and walked towards Karim who was
waiting for him. DSP Husni denied every one of the above
suggestions and maintained what he had said in examination-inchief.

4

Legal Network Series

[8]

In further cross examination, it was put to DSP Husni that whilst
Karim and the accused were discussing where to go for lunch,
Karim received a phone call and excused himself to go to the
toilet. It was whilst the accused was waiting for Karim near the
motorcycle, the police pounced on him and arrested him. It was
also put to DSP Husni that the accused was not carrying
anything in his hands when arrested and the police recovered the
white plastic bag from the motorcycle carrier. DSP Husni
vehemently denied these suggestions as well. DSP Husni,
however, accepted that the accused had no fingers on his left
hand, but denied this made it improbable for him to ride a
motorcycle.

[9]

The Investigating Officer testified that on receiving the seized
items from DSP Husni, he placed his own markings on them. On
4 June 2014, he sealed and sent the drug exhibits to the
government Chemist, Dr Vanitha Kunalan (“PW4”) for chemical
analysis who confirmed that the substance in exhibit P14 was
cannabis as defined under section 2 of the Act.

[10] Under cross examination, the Investigation Officer stated that
the rear number plate of the motorcycle was WTV 1276 and the
front number plate was WTU 1276.
[11] The next witness whose testimony I should like to refer to is that
of Karim, the owner of the motorcycle seized at the shell
station. He testified that registration number of his motorcycle
was WTU 1276 and not WTV 1276. According to Karim, he got
to know the accused about 2 months before the incident. The
accused frequented the nasi lemak stall he operated in Segambut
to buy nasi lemak. On the morning of 2 June 2014, the accused
came to his stall to borrow his motorcycle. He lent his

5



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

motorcycle to the accused who claimed that his motor lorry that
had broken down and needed to look for a mechanic to repair.
[12] Karim stated that he waited at the stall for more than an hour for
the accused to return his motorcycle but the latter failed to show
up as promised. He then decided to head home in his wife’s car.
On his way home, he noticed the accused’s motor lorry parked
on the roadside not far from his stall. The motor lorry remained
at the same spot for the next 4 to 5 days and he did not hear
from the accused. It was only when the police contacted him
about a month later he discovered that his motorcycle had been
seized by the police.
[13] I shall now turn to the highlights of the cross-examination of
this witness. Karim admitted that he did not lodge a report when
the accused failed to return his motorcycle. He did not think
anything was amiss as he thought the accused, who was
physically disabled, was using his motorcycle until he was able
to find the funds to repair his lorry.
[14] It was further put to Karim in cross examination that he was also
known as Babu and that it was he who had transported the drugs
to the Shell station on his motorcycle and the drugs belonged to
him. Next, it was put to him that the accused had come to the
Shell station to meet him to have lunch with him but he had hid
himself in the toilet on receiving information about the presence
of police at the Shell station and the police arrested the accused
by mistake.
[15] Karim emphatically denied all these suggestions and maintained
he was not at the Shell station and the drugs did not belong to
him.

[16] So much was the evidence from the principal witnesses for the
prosecution. The other witnesses produced by the prosecution
gave general evidence in support of the prosecution.
Burden on prosecution
[17] The burden on the prosecution at the close of the prosecution
case to make out a prima facie case is encapsulated in section
180 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Federal Court in Looi
Kow Chai & Anor v. PP [2003] 2 MLJ 65 explained the term
prima facie in this manner:
It is the duty of a judge sitting alone to determine at the
close of the prosecution’s case, as a trier of fact, whether
the prosecution has made out a prima facie case…..It
therefore follows that there is only one exercise that a
judge sitting alone under s. 180 of the CPC has to
undertake at the close of the prosecution case. He must
subject the prosecution evidence to maximum evaluation
and to ask himself the question: if I decide to call upon the
accused to enter his defence and he elects to remain silent,
am I prepared to convict him on the totality of the
evidence contained in the prosecution case? If the answer
is in the negative then no prima facie case has been made
out and the accused would be entitled to an acquittal.
Statutory provisions and Case Law
[18] For convenience, I set out the material sections of the Act on
which the prosecution relied on to prove the charge, or which
are otherwise material to this case.

7



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

[19] The charge against the accused was framed under section 39B
(1) (a) of the Act which provided:
(1)

No person shall, on his own behalf or on behalf of
any other person, whether or not such other person is
in Malaysia –

(a)

traffic in a dangerous drug;

(b)

…

(c)

…

[20] The definition of trafficking is found in section 2 of the Act
which provides:
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —
trafficking includes the doing any of the following acts,
that is to say, manufacturing, importing, exporting,
keeping, concealing, buying, selling, giving, receiving,
storing, administering, transporting, carrying, sending,
delivering, procuring, supplying or distributing any
dangerous drug otherwise than under the authority of this
Act or the regulations made under the Act.
[21] It is settled case law that to sustain a charge of trafficking under
section 2 of the Act, the prosecution must first prove that the
accused had possession of the drugs. Possession is essential as
unless an accused has possession or custody or control of the
drug, he would not be in a position to traffic in the same. In this
regard, Augustine Paul J in Public Prosecutor v. Chia Leong
Foo [2000] 6 MLJ 705, explained:
It must be observed that most of the acts that constitute
trafficking as defined in section 2 of the Act like, for

8



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

example, keeping, concealing, storing, transporting, and
carrying dangerous drugs involve the prerequisite element
of possession … It follows that a person cannot keep,
conceal, store, transport, or carry dangerous drugs within
the meaning of trafficking in the Act without being in the
possession of them
[22] The meaning of possession for the purposes of the Act is well
established. It has been held that there were two elements to
possession. There was the physical element, and the mental
element. The physical element involved proof that the thing was
in the physical custody of the accused or subject to his control.
The mental element involved proof that the accused had
knowledge he was in possession of drugs. In PP v. Muhammad
Nasir b Shaharudin [1994] 2 MLJ 576, the court explained:
Possession is not defined in the DDA. However, it is now
firmly established that to constitute possession, it is
necessary to establish that: (a) the person had knowledge
of the drugs; and (b) that the person had some form of
control or custody of the drugs. To prove either of these
two requirements, the prosecution may either adduce direct
evidence or it may rely on the relevant presumptions under
s. 37 of the DDA.
[23] It is also settled law that to sustain a charge of trafficking, an
accused must be shown to have done the act of trafficking in one
of its forms as found in section 2 of the Act for the purpose of
distributing the drugs to another. See Teh Hock Leong v. Public
Prosecutor [2010] 1 MLJ 741 and Ong Ah Chuan [1981] 1 MLJ
64.
Ingredients of the Offence

9



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

[24] It is clear from the foregoing that to prove the charge, it was
incumbent on the prosecution to prove:
i.

That the substance in exhibit P10 was dangerous
drugs within the definition of section 2 of the Act:
and

ii.

that the accused person had possession of the drugs
i.e. he had custody and control of the drugs and
knowledge that it was dangerous drugs; and

iii.

that the drugs were in the possession of the accused
for the purpose of trafficking.

[25] I turn now to examine the evidence led by the prosecution to
prove the ingredients of the offence.
Whether the substance was dangerous drugs within the definition
of section 2 of the Act
[26] As regards ingredient (i), there was clear evidence that the
substance sent for analysis to Dr Vanitha Kunalan was the
substance seized from the white plastic bag at the Shell station.
The evidence of Dr Vanitha Kunalan was not seriously
challenged, and her evidence established that the substance
contained a net weight of 2797 of cannabis, and that cannabis
was a dangerous drug and came within the definition of section
2 of the Act
Whether the accused had possession of the dangerous drugs
[27] To prove possession, the prosecution sought to rely on the
evidence of DSP Husni that the accused was carrying the white
plastic bag that contained the drugs. The learned Deputy Public

10



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

Prosecutor contended that he was a reliable witness and urged
the court to accept his oral testimony.
[28] It was contended that DSP Husni’s evidence established that the
accused had physical custody or control of the white plastic bag
that contained the drugs and this entitled the prosecution to rely
on the presumption of possession under section 37(d) of the Act.
The said section read:
In all proceedings under this Act or any regulations made
thereunder(a)

….

(b)

….

(c)

….

(d)

any person who is found to have had in his custody
or under his control anything whatsoever containing
any dangerous drug shall, until the contrary is
proved, be deemed to have in possession of such drug
and shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to
have known the nature of such drug;

[29] The question I needed to consider was whether DSP Husni was a
credible witness. It is settled law that a judge in deciding
whether to accept or reject the evidence of a witness, must test it
against certain criteria. He must, take into account the presence
or absence of motive that a witness may have in giving
evidence. And, if there are contemporary documents, test the
oral evidence of a witness against these documents.
[30] In the instant case, the oral evidence of DSP Husni clashed with
the search list, a contemporaneous document that was prepared

11



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

by him soon after the seizure of the drugs. In his evidence, DSP
Husni alleged that the drugs were recovered from the white
plastic bag that the accused was carrying. However, the search
list stated that the drugs were recovered from “di tepi
motorsikal”. For some inexplicable reason, DSP Husni was not
asked and proffered no explanation as to why there was a
contradiction between his oral evidence and the search list on a
critical issue. It cannot be gainsaid that both statements made by
DSP Husni could not be true.
[31] The importance of contemporaneous documentary evidence was
considered by the Federal Court in Tindok Besar Estate Sdn Bhd
v. Tinjar Co [1979]2 MLJ 229. Chang Min Tat FJ, in delivering
the judgment of the Federal Court observed:
Nevertheless the learned trial judge expressed himself to
be completely satisfied with the veracity of the
respondent’s witnesses and their evidence. He purported to
come to certain findings of fact on the oral evidence but
did not notice or consider that the respondent’s oral
evidence openly clashed with its contemporaneous
documentary evidence. For myself, I would with respect
feel somewhat safer to refer to and rely on the acts and
deeds of a witness which are contemporaneous with the
event and to draw the reasonable inferences from them
than to believe his subsequent recollection or version of it,
particularly if he is a witness with a purpose of his own to
serve and if it did not account for the statements in his
documents and writings. Judicial reception of evidence
requires that the oral evidence be critically tested against
the whole of the other evidence and the circumstances of
the case. Plausibility should never be mistaken for
veracity.
12



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

[32] It has also been held that when a witness makes two statements
which differ in material particulars there must necessarily be
ground for believing that he was not a truthful witness and his
evidence was suspect. See Mohamed Kasdi v. PP [1969] 1 MLJ
135, Adzhaar bin Ahmad & Anor v. PP [1996] 4 MLJ 85 and PP
v. Lee Eng Kooi [1993] 2 MLJ 322. In instances like this where
there is a serious contradiction in the prosecution evidence, the
law leans in favour of the accused and the evidence favourable
to the accused must be preferred.
[33] In view of the serious conflict between the oral evidence of DSP
Husni and the search list, I rejected DSP Husni’s oral evidence.
[34] It bears mention that the oral evidence of DSP Husni that the
accused was carrying the white plastic bag that contained the
drugs was also inadmissible on another ground. The duty of the
Raiding Officer to prepare a search list is mandated by section
64 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The provision read:
A list of all things seized in the course of a search made
under this Chapter and of the places in which they are
respectively found shall be prepared by the officer or other
person making the search and signed by him.
[35] By virtue of section 64, a search list is a document required by
law to be reduced to the form of a document. In Ah Mee v. PP
[1967] 1 MLJ 220 the Federal Court in addressing the scope of
section 91 of the Evidence Act 1950 stated:
Section 91 of the Evidence Ordinance applies equally to
criminal trials, no less than to civil proceedings, and it
categorically states that “in all cases in which any matter
is required by law to be reduced to the form of a
document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms

13



[2017] 1 LNS 2045

Legal Network Series

… of such matter except the document itself.” The report
was information relating to the commission of an offence
which “shall be reduced to writing” pursuant to section
107 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 6), and section
92 of the Evidence Ordinance goes on to exclude all parole
evidence seeking to contradict or vary what was set out in
writing. Hence it should have remained uncontradicted, on
the prosecution evidence, that whoever might have raped
the complainant he was certainly not this appellant.
[36] The decision in Ah Mee v. PP illustrates that the prohibition
contained in section 91 of the evidence Act 1950 precludes oral
evidence being led to contradict or vary the contents in the
search list. The prosecution, in the absence of any explanation
for the variance between DSP Husni’s oral evidence and the
search list, was bound by the facts noted in the search list.
[37] For the reason stated, I found that the prosecution had failed to
prove that the accused had physical custody of the white plastic
bag that contained the drugs.
[38] In view of my finding it became unnecessary to consider the
third ingredient.
Conclusion
[39] I therefore found that the prosecution had failed to prove a
prima facie case of trafficking against the accused. The accused
was accordingly acquitted and discharged.
