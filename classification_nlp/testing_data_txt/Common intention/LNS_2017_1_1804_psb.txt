JUDGMENT
Introduction
[1]

Both accused were charged with the offence of trafficking in
2928 grams of cannabis, under s. 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous
Drugs Act 1952 (‘DDA 1952’), which is punishable with death
under s. 39B(2) of the same Act.

[2]

The charge read as follows:“Bahawa kamu bersama-sama pada 14 Januari 2014 jam lebih
kurang 7.20 petang bertempat di kawasan parking Pasaraya TF
Value Mart, hadapan Restoran Marybrown, Jalan Lintang di
dalam Daerah Sungai Siput Utara, di dalam Negeri Perak Darul
Ridzuan telah mengedar dadah berbahaya iaitu sejumlah berat
2928 gram Cannabis dan dengan itu kamu telah melakukan satu
kesalahan dibawah Seksyen 39B (1)(a) Akta Dadah Berbahaya
1952 dan boleh dihukum di bawah Seksyen 39B (2) Akta yang
sama”.

The prosecution’s case
[3]

ASP Mohd Suffian Bin Saari (‘SP1’) was the head of the Crime
Investigation Department of the Narcotics Division in Perak. He

3



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

was the agent provocateur. He had on the 4 January 2014,
received information from an unnamed source that an Indian
man that goes by the name Viki, deals in drug transactions by
the kilos. Viki was the second accused. SP1 instructed the
source to inform the second accused that he wishes to buy drugs
from the latter. SP1 was informed the following day that the
second accused had agreed to deal with him. SP1 then called the
second accused at the number 014-6012583, and introduced
himself as ‘Abal’ from Grik. They had agreed to meet the
following day at the Restoran Aziz Tomyam in Chemor Ipoh.
[4]

The rendezvous happened as planned on the 6 January 2014. SP1
and Detective Corporal Syafie met up with the second accused at
around 8.00 pm. The second accused did not come alone. He was
accompanied by the first defendant, and had introduced the
latter as Rajan. They both came on a Modenas motorcycle.

[5]

SP1 told the second accused that he was interested in buying
drugs by the kilo. The discussion was only between SP1 and the
second accused, and it went on for about twenty minutes. SP1
was informed by the second accused that a kilogram of drugs
would cost RM2,700.00. No deal however was concluded that
night.

[6]

Six days later on the 12 January 2014, SP1 received a call from
the second accused. The latter had agreed to supply SP1 with
five kilograms of drugs. They then planned to meet up the
following day at the parking lot of the TF supermarket in Sungai
Siput. The Marybrown restaurant was located in front of this
supermarket.

[7]

Come the 13 January 2014, SP1 met the first and second accused
at the designated meeting place at 8.00 p.m. Both accused came
on a motorcycle. The second accused did not come supplied with
4



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

five kilogrammes worth of drugs as requested by SP1. SP1 saw
the second accused making a phone call, and after the phone call
ended, told SP1 that he could not supply SP1 with the drugs, as
his ‘boss’ had some problems in Taman Guam in Ipoh. The
second accused then told SP1 that he could only supply him the
following day. They then agreed to meet at noon the next day.
[8]

The following day on the 14 January 2014, SP1 and Detective
Corporal Syafie waited at the same place, at 1.00 p.m. SP1 then
contacted the second accused on the same phone number that he
had been calling. He told the second accused that he had already
arrived.

[9]

The first and second accused came an hour later on the same
motorcycle that he saw them on the previous day. The second
accused told SP1 that he had the supply, and asked SP1 to show
him the money. SP1 took the money from Detective Corporal
Syafie who was waiting in the car. SP1 showed them the sum of
RM13,500.00 in cash. The first accused was all this while next
to the second accused and SP1.

[10] The first accused then left on the same motorcycle, leaving the
second accused behind with SP1 and Detective Corporal Syafie.
The second accused said that the first accused was making
arrangements to get the drugs. SP1 and the second accused then
proceeded to have a drink at a Chinese restaurant behind the TF
supermarket, while Detective Corporal Syafie waited in the car.
A couple of hours passed without any activity. The second
accused and SP1 then left the restaurant and proceeded to wait
in front of the TF supermarket.
[11] The first accused came back around 5.00 p.m. He then spoke to
the second accused. The second accused then told SP1 that they
had to go and get the drugs. Forty-five minutes later, the second
5



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

accused called SP1, and said that he could only manage to get
three kilograms for the price of RM8,100.00. SP1 agreed and
waited. It was only at 7.00 p.m. when both accused came back
on the same motorcycle. They showed SP1 the three kilograms
worth of drugs in the basket of their motorcycle. According to
SP1, there were three compressed packages containing cannabis
in a black plastic bag.
[12] It was the opportunity that SP1 had waited for. He then
scratched his head, which was a signal to ASP Mohd Fikri Bin
Hashim (‘SP5’) and his team to move in. SP5 and his team
arrested both accused. According to SP5, the second accused had
put up a struggle, but was successfully apprehended. SP5 then
inspected the motorcycle’s basket, and found a black plastic bag
containing three compressed packages of substance that he
suspected were cannabis. SP5 proceeded to seize the drugs.
[13] SP5 and his team had been in three unmarked cars near the
rendezvous point for SP1 and both accused. They had been
observing the activities between SP1, Detective Corporal Syafie
and both accused from 1 p.m. until the arrest which was around
7.20 p.m.
[14] SP5 had seized the drugs, the Modenas motorcycle and the keys
to it, two mobile phones from the first accused with the make
Samsung GT-S5570 (exhibit P-18B) and Nokia C200 (exhibit P18A) respectively, one Samsung GT-E 1195 (exhibit P-18C)
mobile phone from the second accused, and a Nokia 101 mobile
phone from SP1. He then handed over these items to the
Investigating Officer, ASP Mohd Radzi Bin Abdul Rahim
(‘SP7’).
[15] SP7 had forwarded the seized drugs to Dr. Silverraji A/L
Samiveloo (‘SP2’), a chemist with the Jabatan Kimia Malaysia,
6



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

whom after analysing the drugs using the standard and
recommended methods concluded that they were cannabis
weighing 2,928 gram.
[16] SP7 had also forwarded the mobile phones seized from both
accused and SP1 to the police’s forensics department for
analysis. These mobile phones were received and analysed by
DSP Safawi Bin Mat Salleh (‘SP6’).
[17] SP6 had used a software called ‘XRY’ to extract the data from
all the mobile phones forwarded to him. SP6 had also prepared
several reports based on the analysis done and data extracted
from all the mobile phones. The report on the data extracted
from mobile phone used by SP1 was marked as exhibit P-27, and
the report on the data extracted from the mobile phone seized
from the second accused marked as exhibit P-29.
[18] The summary of SP6’s report and his evidence through
examination-in-chief are as follows:(a)

The mobile phone seized from the second accused uses the
number 014-6012583;

[19] SP6 has upon analysing the data extracted from the second
accused’s mobile phone, concluded that the sms sent from SP1’s
mobile phone were received on the second accused’s mobile
phone.
The court’s duty at the end of the prosecution’s case
[20] The court shall, in accordance with s. 180(1) Criminal Procedure
Code (‘CPC’), consider and decide whether the prosecution has
established a prima facie case against the accused, at the end of
the prosecution’s case. The accused shall be acquitted if there
was no finding of a prima facie case, and conversely call upon
the accused to enter his defence, if a prima facie case has been
made out; s. 180(2) and (3) CPC.

[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

[21] In Balachandran v. PP [2005] 2 MLJ 301 (FC), the apex court
held that a prima facie case is made out when the prosecution
has successfully adduced sufficient evidence to prove each and
every single ingredient of the offence alleged, which if
unrebutted or unexplained, will result in conviction. This is also
provided under s. 180(4) CPC.
[22] It is incumbent for the court to undertake a positive and
maximum evaluation of the prosecution’s evidence, by assessing
the prosecution’s witnesses, and drawing inferences from the
evidence produced by the prosecution. The court is however
duty bound to draw the inference that is favourable to the
accused; PP v. Mohd Radzi bin Abu Bakar [2005] 6 MLJ 393
(FC)
Findings of the prosecution’s case
The ingredients of the charge
[23] For the prosecution to make out a prima facie against both
accused, they would be required to establish:(i)

That the drugs are scheduled as dangerous drugs under
DDA 1952; and

(ii)

That both accused had the common intention to sell the
impugned drugs.

Whether the drugs are scheduled as dangerous drugs under DDA
1952
[24] SP5 had in his report (exhibit P-11) and his testimony in court,
concluded that the three packages seized from the accused were

9



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

cannabis, a dangerous drug as stipulated under s. 2 DDA 1952,
weighing 2928 gram.
[25] Mohamed Azmi SCJ, delivering judgment for the Supreme Court
(as it then was), in Munusamy Vengadasalam v. PP [1987] 1
MLJ 492 (SC), said this:“As a rule, a chemist in drug cases does not give any opinion as
to ownership, control or possession of the substance sent for
analysis, but he merely reports the result of the chemical
examination of the substance. The only reason for sending the
exhibits to the chemist is to determine their identity and to
confirm what other witnesses have suspected. This type of
opinion must in our view be distinguished from opinions which
are of very technical or complicated nature, such as those given
by handwriting, trade mark, copy right or ballistic experts.
Without being derogatory it is common knowledge that even
animals, such as snuff dogs when sufficiently trained, are able
to detect certain dangerous drugs. We are therefore of the view,
that is this type of cases where the opinion of the chemist is
confined only to the elementary nature and identity of substance,
the court is entitled to accept the opinion of the expert on its
face value, unless it is inherently incredible or the defence calls
evidence in rebuttal by another expert to contradict the opinion.
So long as some credible evidence is given by the chemist to
support his opinion, there is no necessity for him to go into
details of what he did in the laboratory, step by step.”
[26] I find that SP2’s evidence, by way of his report, was not
inherently incredible, and neither was it credibly challenged. It
would therefore be safe for me to conclude, that the drugs seized
from the accused were of the type and weight as set out in the
charge against both accused. The prosecution has successfully

10



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

proven the nature and identity of the drugs seized from both
accused.
Whether both accused were trafficking in the drugs
[27] The prosecution’s case, based on the evidence produced, was
premised on the negotiated sale of the cannabis by the accused
to an agent provocateur, namely SP1. The Court of Appeal in
Sayat Ahmad Nazir Ahmad v. PP [2014] 7 CLJ 1025 (CA), held
that it is settled law that it is not necessary to invoke a
presumption of possession, custody or control for a case of
trafficking premised on s. 2 DDA 1952. The appellate court
further held that knowledge may be inferred from the facts and
circumstances of the case where there was a direct evidence of
trafficking under s. 2 DDA 1952.
[28] The prosecution sought to establish from the evidence, that both
accused were selling the drugs to SP1. The prosecution’s case
was premised on s. 2 DDA 1952, which defined trafficking as
follows:includes the doing of any of the following acts, that is to say,
manufacturing, importing, exporting, keeping, concealing,
buying, selling, giving, receiving, storing, administering,
transporting,
carrying,
sending,
delivering,
procuring,
supplying or distributing any dangerous drug otherwise than
under the authority of this Act or the regulations made under the
Act.
[29] SP1’s testimony was crucial to the prosecution’s case. SP1 had
obtained information from an unnamed source, that the second
accused sells drugs. SP1 then asked his informer to inform the
second accused that he was interested in buying drugs in bulk,

11



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

namely by the kilos. He was then informed that the second
accused had agreed to deal with him. After obtaining the second
accused’s mobile phone number, SP1 proceeded to call the
second accused at the number 014-6012583. It was agreed that
they were to meet the following day at the Restoran Aziz
Tomyam in Chemor Ipoh.
[30] SP1 met up with the second accused as planned. SP1 had gone
with a Detective Corporal Syafie. The second accused however
did not come alone, as the first defendant had accompanied him.
[31] After introducing each other, SP1 proceeded to tell the second
accused what he had already mentioned in his telephone
conversation. The second accused had informed SP1 that a
kilogram of drugs would cost RM2,700.00. Throughout the
conversation between SP1 and the second accused, the first
accused was seated on the same table.
[32] There was no deal concluded that night. SP1 received a call
from the second accused some six days later, who told him that
he would be able to supply five kilograms of drugs. The call was
also made from the number 014-6012583. It was then planned by
both of them to meet up the following day in front of the TF
supermarket in Sungai Siput.
[33] Similar to the first meeting, both accused came together. They
met at the designated meeting place at 8 p.m. However, the
accused did not come with any drugs. SP1 was told that the
second accused could only supply him the next day. Throughout
this time, SP1 was standing outside his car whilst both accused
stood near him. It was then planned for them to meet the
following day at the same place at noon.

12



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

[34] The following day, both SP1 and Detective Corporal Syafie
waited at the same place as planned. As none of the accused was
around, SP1 called the second accused at the number 0146012583 to let him know that he was there. Both accused arrived
about an hour later on a motorcycle.
[35] The second accused told SP1 that he would be able to supply the
drugs to SP1, but had asked SP1 to show him the money. That
he did. SP1 showed the second accused the sum of RM13,500.00
in cash. The first accused was all this while next the second
accused.
[36] After being shown the cash, the first accused left with his
motorcycle. Only the second accused stayed with SP1. The latter
was told by the second accused that the first accused had gone to
get the drugs.
[37] The second accused came back a few hours later at around 5.00
p.m. but empty-handed. The first accused then spoke to the
second accused. He then informed SP1 that he had to go off with
the first accused to get the drugs, and told SP1 to wait again. It
was only forty-five minutes later when the second accused
called SP1, and told him that he could only manage to get three
kilograms. The second accused told SP1 to get RM8,100.00
ready.
[38] SP1 waited again. At around 7 p.m. both accused came back on
the same motorcycle. SP1 was then shown the drugs kept in a
black plastic bag in the basket of their motorcycle. What
transpired then was the arrest of both accused upon SP1 giving
the raiding team the planned signal.
[39] As both accused were charged pursuant to s. 34 Penal Code, it
was necessary for the prosecution to prove that both of them had

13



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

the intention to traffic in the drugs seized. To achieve that, the
prosecution would need to establish that both accused were in
the place and took part in the crime or had nexus to it; see Aung
Thun v. PP [2014] 1 MLJ 784 (CA).
[40] These facts, taken from the onset, show the negotiations that had
taken place between the second accused and SP1 that culminated
into a deal agreed. SP1 had made it known to the second accused
that he wanted to purchase drugs in kilos. The negotiations
between SP1 and the second accused were done over a few
telephone calls and two meetings.
[41] The second accused’s phone number given by the informer to
SP1 was 014-6012583. This was the only number that SP1 had
used to contact the second accused. I accept the evidence by SP6
that the mobile phone that was seized from the second accused
(exhibit P-27) had the same number, which was 014-6012583.
There was no credible challenge made to SP6, which raised any
doubt on his findings. I have also considered the messages
exchanged between the first accused and SP1’s mobile phone,
and found that the messages and telephone calls made were done
within the negotiation period that SP1 and the second accused
were involved in.
[42] In fact, it was during the first meeting that the second accused
told SP1 that he would be able to supply drugs by the kilos. It
was also at that meeting that the second accused informed SP1
that it would cost him RM2,700.00 per kilogram. Although no
deal was concluded that night, the deal had been put into
motion. SP1 wanted to buy drugs by the kilos, and the second
accused had agreed to provide the supply. What remained then
was for the deal to materialise.

14



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

[43] It was about six days later when the second accused told SP1
that he had a ready supply of drugs for SP1, who then told the
second accused that he wanted to purchase five kilograms.
Although it was agreed for them to meet the following day to
conclude the deal, that did not happen until the day after. On the
day concerned, SP1 had shown both accused RM13,500.00 in
cash. This amount was for the purchase of five kilograms.
However, this was reduced to three kilograms, and that the
second accused had told SP1 to prepare RM8,100.00, which was
also agreed. This eventually led to both accused returning later
with the drugs that were kept in the basket of the motorcycle
that they were on. Both accused were on the same motorcycle
where the drugs were found.
Common intention
[44] Learned counsel for the first accused submitted that there was
no common intention between the first accused and the second
accused. Learned counsel referred to the fact that the SP1 had
only received information of a person named “Viki” from the
informer. He highlighted the fact that SP1 had in his testimony
confirmed that he had only spoken to the second accused, and
that although the first accused was present when SP1 first met
up with the second accused, he was not involved in the
negotiations. Reference was also made to SP1’s crossexamination by the first accused’s learned counsel, where the
former agreed that the first accused was merely riding the
motorcycle and the second accused the pillion rider. It was
submitted that the first accused had never taken any active
participation in the negotiations between the second accused and
SP1, and that his role was merely to accompany the second
accused by ferrying him to all the meetings.

15



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

[45] The Supreme Court in Namasiyam v. PP [1987] 2 MLJ 336 (SC),
held that common intention must be proved either by direct or
circumstantial evidence, that there was firstly, a common
intention to commit the offence, and secondly the participation
of the accused in furtherance of that common intention. The
Court of Appeal in Sahri Tahe v. PP [2016] 4 MLJ 69 in
referring to s. 34 PC held as follows:“This section is intended to make a person liable for the
commission of an offence not committed by him, but by another
person with whom he shared the common intention. It is also to
deal with cases in which it is difficult to prove exactly what part
was played by each of them in the commission of the offence or
in cases where it is difficult to distinguish between acts of
individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the
common intention of all…”
[46] In Dato Mokhtar Hashim v. PP [1983] 2 MLJ 232, the court
held:
“Under section 34 of the Penal Code, to succeed the prosecution
must prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to
the prearranged plan or arrangement. In practice it is of course
difficult to produce direct evidence to prove the intention of an
individual. In most cases, however, it can be inferred from his
act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case. See
Mahbub Shah v. King Emperor. The doctrine of common
intention is an expressed in section 34 of the Penal Code, itself
which reads‘When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance
of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for
the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him
alone’.”

The court also added that the leading feature of s. 34 PC is the
element of participation in action.
[47] The intention of the first accused could only be gleaned from the
circumstances of the case. Here, both accused were present when
SP1 met to negotiate for the sale of the drugs. The first accused
was always next to the second accused whenever they met SP1.
On the day that they were arrested, the drugs were not delivered
yet when SP1 first met them. The first accused, according to
SP1, left him with the second accused for a while. According to
the second accused, the first accused had gone to arrange for the
five kilograms of drugs. Now when the first accused returned, he
was empty-handed in that the drugs were still not delivered. The
second accused then spoke to the first accused, and they then
both left on the same motorcycle. When both accused returned,
the second accused, who rode pillion, got off the motorcycle and
showed the drugs, which were in the basket of the motorcycle to
SP1. When this was done, the second accused was clearly in
close proximity, as he was on the same motorcycle.
[48] The facts show that both accused did not have the drugs on them
when they first met SP1 on the day concerned. Both accused had
left SP1 and returned around 7.00 p.m. with the drugs, which
was then showed to SP1. They were both on the same
motorcycle. The fact that the first accused had always
accompanied the second accused is also a relevant factor. They
clearly worked as a team. It is therefore safe to conclude that
there was a prior meeting of minds between both accused for the
sale of the drugs.
[49] It is also my finding that the when SP1 showed the accused the
sum of RM13,500.00 initially for the purchase of five kilograms
as consideration for the sale and supply of five kilograms, this

17



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

evidence constitute the act of trafficking in s. 2 DDA 1952.
Although the accused could only get three kilograms, it was also
agreed that the purchase price would be RM8,100.00. The act of
selling and supplying within the meaning of s. 2 DDA 1952 has
been completed. I therefore find that the prosecution has
successfully established that both accused were trafficking in
the drugs seized.
[50] In attempting to exonerate the first accused, learned counsel
sought to invoke the presumption under s. 114(g) Evidence Act
1950 (‘EA 1950’) for the prosecution’s failure to call the first
accused’s wife. It was established through SP7 that he had taken
a statement from the first accused’s wife, and that the latter had
informed him that she had worked as a Guest Service Assistant
at the Fairpark Hotel in Ipoh. It was further established that the
motorcycle that the first accused rode was registered in his
wife’s name, and that the first accused had gone to fetch her
from work at around 3.30 p.m. It was submitted that the first
accused’s wife would be able to provide evidence, that the first
accused had indeed picked her up from work at around 3.30 p.m.
[51] I fail to see how the first accused’s wife testimony could help to
exonerate the first accused’s participation. If indeed the first
accused had left the scene to pick her up that does not help to
exculpate his participation. The pertinent fact is that first
accused was present during the negotiations and when the drugs
were shown to SP1 to complete the sale. The first accused’s
absence for a period of time if true, does nothing to absolve his
participation.
[52] It was also submitted by the learned counsel for the first
accused, that s. 114(g) EA 1950 should also be invoked against
the prosecution for failing to tender the recording captured by

18



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

the TF Supermarket’s Close Circuit Television Camera
(‘CCTV’). It was submitted that the CCTV placed outside the
supermarket could shed some light on the alleged transaction
that took place, and that the prosecution’s failure to procure and
produce the recording is adverse to its case.
[53] I fail to see how any recording could help to strengthen the
evidence of the prosecution. The testimony of SP1 alone is
sufficient. There was nothing vague about his testimony that
would require the prosecution to rely on any CCTV recordings.
In any event, SP7 had during the course of his investigation,
visited the supermarket, and discovered that there were no
cameras pointing towards the location where the accused and
SP1 were located.
[54] Similar to the first accused, the second accused too sought to
invoke the provisions of s. 114(g) EA 1950. Unlike the first
accused however, the second accused’s attempt is premised on
the prosecution’s failure to produce the telephone records of the
second accused. The importance of the telephone records is to
show the involvement of what he says was SP1’s informer, a
man named Govindaraju a/l Raveandranathan, also known as
Gopi. It was submitted that Gopi was a known drug dealer, and
that SP1 had been dealing with him since January 2014. The
theory put forward was that Gopi would sacrifice any of his
‘runners’ tasked to deliver drugs, by giving the police
information, and that in return, he would be given the freedom
to continue his trade. Gopi would then demand money from the
families of the runners arrested for him allegedly to negotiate
their release from the police. In this case, it was submitted that
Gopi had taken RM70,000.00 from the family of the second
accused.

19



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

[55] Learned counsel also highlighted that both SP1 and SP7 had
utilised Gopi in another drug case, where it ended in the arrest
of a man named Ganesh Kumar. SP1 was apparently the
arresting officer, and SP7 the investigating officer in that case,
and that they had in this case also used Gopi. The fact is
however, Gopi has since died, allegedly due to blunt trauma to
his head. Although learned counsel for the second accused
tendered a copy of his death certificate, it was not marked as an
exhibit (IDD-36). Nevertheless, the prosecution did not dispute
his death.
[56] It was claimed that Gopi’s occupation was to repossess vehicles.
He had apparently told the second accused to meet him at the car
park of the supermarket with the promise of returning the
latter’s motorcycle that he had repossessed. Learned counsel
also submitted that SP1 had been dealing with Gopi since 1
January 2014, and that the prosecution had only prepared the
second accused’s telephone record from 8 January 2014,
although he had requested the records from 1 January 2014. Had
he obtained the records from 1 January 2014, it would show that
SP1 had been dealing with the second accused before the 4
January 2014.
[57] Learned counsel for the second accused submitted that the
telephone records tendered in court shows that there were some
messages and calls made to and also received from Gopi. Gopi’s
number, it was claimed, was 010-3770089 and 010-3771957.
These messages and calls suggest that Gopi had played an active
role. Both SP1 and SP7 had denied any knowledge of Gopi’s
telephone number. SP7 under cross-examination admitted that he
did not investigate these numbers and that only the
telecommunication service provider such as Celcom or Digi
could provide that information. Learned counsel submitted that
20



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

the prosecution’s failure to call anyone from the
telecommunication service provider and its failure to provide the
second accused’s mobile phone records from 1 to 7 January
2014, gives rise to an adverse inference against the prosecution
under s. 114(g) EA 1950. Learned counsel submitted that the
prosecution had withheld and suppressed crucial evidence that
could exonerate his client.
[58] SP6 had under cross, explained that the XRY software that he
had used to extract the information from the mobile phones and
their sim card, would retrieve all information contained in them.
SP6 also stated that the information retrieved were as they were,
and that he did not erase any information. When pressed further
by learned counsel for the second accused, SP6 stated that if the
information for a certain period were not retrieved, it could only
have meant that the user would have deleted the information. He
was adamant that the software could not erase any detail once
they are extracted.
[59] SP7 under cross also stated that he had only focused on the
details contained from the time that SP1 was in communication
with the second accused, and that he did not see any need to
investigate the calls made before then. SP7 had nevertheless
attempted to obtain the telephone bills for the mobile phone
seized from the accused from Celcom and Digi. A letter
prepared by an Inspector Mohd Al Shukri bin Nasir was
tendered as evidence of that attempt (exhibit P34). He was
informed that they only kept records for two months.
[60] The contention by learned counsel for the second accused that
the prosecution had suppressed evidence is therefore without
merits. I find that the police had only retrieved information that
are pertinent, namely from the time that SP1 made contact with

21



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

the second accused. Although learned counsel for the second
accused had incessantly crossed SP1 and SP7 on Gopi, I find
their testimony credible. The proposition put forward that Gopi
had set up the second accused is at this point in time,
unsupported by any cogent material to substantiate it.
[61] In any event, the telephone records and the messages put
forward in evidence were not entirely crucial for the
prosecution’s case. SP1’s testimony pertaining to the meetings
and negotiations held with both accused were sufficient to
establish the prosecution’s case that there were a series of
continuous act leading to the sale of the drugs by both accused.
These meetings show the voluntariness of both accused. I find
no evidence to suggest that both accused were duped or
entrapped into making the deal. Entrapment, I might add offers
no defence; see Wan Mohd Azman Hassan v. PP [2010] 4 CLJ
529 (FC).
Conclusion at the end of the prosecution’s case
[62] I have considered all the evidence adduced by the prosecution,
and subjected them to maximum evaluation, and am satisfied
that the prosecution has adduced credible evidence to
successfully prove a prima facie case against both accused, as
envisaged under s. 180(4) CPC.
[63] Both accused were therefore called to enter their defence. They
elected to give evidence on oath.
The defence
[64] Both accused chose to tender their witness statements pursuant
to s. 402B CPC. The first accused’s witness statement was
22



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

marked as exhibit WSD-1 and the second accused’s statement
marked as exhibit WSD-3. Other than the two accused giving
evidence for the defence, the first accused had also called upon
his wife, Logeswary A/P Segaran (‘SD3’) to testify. The second
accused had called upon Mohamed Salleh Bin Jaafar Sidek
(‘SD4’), a registration officer from the Larut, Matang & Selama
National Registration Department, and his sister, Geetha A/P
Revindranathan (‘SD5’) to give evidence.
The first accused
[65] The first accused claimed that he had merely accompanied the
second accused to meet the latter’s friends on the 6 January
2014. He admitted being at the same table with the second
accused and two other men, at the Restoran Aziz Tomyam in
Chemor, Ipoh. The two other men, he claimed was an Indian
man and a Malay man. He did not know who they were but
eventually found out that the Indian man’s name was Gopi.
[66] The second accused conversed with the Indian man in Tamil but
the first accused claimed that he did not know what the
conversation was about, as he had kept occupied with his mobile
phone. The first accused nevertheless overheard the first
accused and Gopi talking about a motorcycle, but that was about
it.
[67] The first accused also admitted to being present at the TF
Supermarket’s car park together with the second accused on the
13 January 2014. Similar to the first meeting, the first accused
claimed that he had merely helped the second accused by
ferrying the latter there on the motorcycle belonging to his wife,
as the second accused had no transportation. The second accused

23



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

told him that he wanted to meet the same men that he had met
previously.
[68] While there, the first accused saw the second accused talking to
Gopi. He claimed not to have heard their conversation, as he
was ten feet away. He did not see the other man there, namely
the Malay man. At one point in time he had gone to the toilet
and saw that Gopi was no longer around when he returned. He
and the second accused then left. The first accused did enquire
with the second accused what had transpired. He was told that
the men had offered their help to get the second accused’s
motorcycle back, which had apparently been repossessed in
December 2013.
[69] The following day at approximately 2.30 p.m., the second asked
the first accused to accompany him to retrieve the former’s
motorcycle. They headed to the TF supermarket. Upon reaching
there, the first accused saw the Malay man that he had met
previously waiting. Gopi was not in sight. The second accused
and the Malay man had a chat, but the first accused did not
know what the conversation was about, as he was ten feet away.
He then recused himself at around 3.30 p.m. to pick up his wife
who worked at the Fair Park Hotel in Ipoh. He had picked his
wife up from work and sent her home in Klebang, Ipoh. He had
to return back to where he had left the second accused, as the
latter told him that he did not get his motorcycle back.
[70] Upon reaching there at around 7.00 p.m., the first accused saw
that Gopi was there with the second accused. Gopi then told him
to park his motorcycle next to his motorcycle. He obliged. Gopi
then asked both him and the second accused to meet the Malay
man who was then seated in a car about thirty meters away. He
saw Gopi going over to the place where both motorcycles were

24



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

parked. At the same time, the police suddenly swooped in and
arrested him and the second accused. The police told him that
they had found drugs in his motorcycle’s basket. He was
astounded as he was certain that there was no plastic bag in the
basket, and that he had only left his mobile phone in there.
[71] SD2 also chose to give evidence through a witness statement
(exhibit WSD-2). In her statement, SD2 stated that she worked
at the Fair Park Hotel, and that the first accused had sent her to
work on the day that the first accused was arrested. SD2 claimed
that the first accused had picked her up from work at 3.45 p.m.
and sent her back home. The first accused then left, saying that
he had to pick up a friend from Sungai Siput.
[72] Under cross-examination, SD2 admitted that she and the first
accused had two other vehicles in their possession other than the
Modenas motorcycle used by the first accused, namely a car, and
a Honda scooter. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (‘DPP’)
in cross-examination confronted SD2 with her cautioned
statement (exhibit P-38). She acknowledged that the signature in
the statement was hers. The learned DPP then sought to rely on
s. 145(1) and s. 155(c) Evidence Act 1950 (‘EA 1950’) to
impeach SD2.
[73] In seeking to impeach SD2, the learned DPP highlighted the
relevant parts of the statement in red, which he claimed
contradicted her testimony during cross-examination. A copy of
this statement was also extended to the both accused’s counsel.
The learned DPP submitted that the discrepancies were material.
[74] In impeachment proceedings, s. 155 EA 1950 must be read
together with s. 145 EA 1950. In CGU Insurance Bhd v. Asean
Security Paper Mills Sdn Bhd [2006] 3 MLJ 1 (FC), the Federal

25



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

Court held that it is mandatory for the procedure under s. 145(1)
EA 1950 to be adhered.
[75] In conducting the impeachment proceedings, I had closely
adhered to the impeachment procedures set out in the case of
Muthusamy v. PP [1948] 1 MLJ 57, which was approved by the
apex court in Krishnan v. PP [1981] 2 MLJ 121 (FC).
[76] I had compared the alleged discrepancies in SD2’s statement
against her testimony, and concluded that there were material
contradictions. In making that finding, I therefore allowed the
prosecution’s application to impeach SD2.
[77] SD2 was shown the statement, and her attention was directed to
the parts highlighted in red. The statement was read out to her in
Tamil through the court’s interpreter. She was then given the
opportunity to explain each and every highlighted statement,
that the prosecution claimed contradicted her testimony in court.
The following is the transcript of SD2’s explanation, with her
answers in italic:(1)

[78] Counsel for both accused then proceeded to question her. In
essence, SD2 claimed that she was in a state of disarray when
making the statement, and that the recording officer had never
neither explained nor read back the statement taken. SD2 also
claimed that the recording officer did not translate the contents
of the statement in Tamil to her.
[79] At the end of the impeachment proceedings, I was mindful of the
need to assess SD2’s evidence as a whole against the other
evidence, only at the end of the defence’s case, and not make a
ruling immediately; see Dato’ Mokhtar Hashim v. PP (supra). I
had therefore kept in abeyance my assessment of SD2’s
credibility.
The second accused
[80] The second accused claimed that Gopi and his friends had
repossessed his motorcycle sometime in December 2013. Gopi
had on the 1 January 2014, called him and claimed that he could
help to get his motorcycle back cheap through a Malay man. He
had been in communication with Gopi through the number 0103770089 from the 1 January 2014 to 6 January 2014.
[81] On the 4 January 2014, Gopi had arranged for him to meet with
a man named Suffian, whom he claimed could get his
motorcycle out for a small price. The first accused told Gopi
that he had to think about it, as he only had RM200.00. He did
not want to commit yet.
[82] Together with the first accused, the second accused met up with
Gopi and Suffian on the 6 January 2014, at the Restoran Aziz
Tomyam in Chemor, Ipoh. Gopi told him to put forward some

28



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

money upfront, and told him to get RM500.00. The second
accused was not sure that he could get that much money.
[83] On the 8 January 2014, Gopi called him again using the same
number. This time around, he was told that there was an Abang
Mat who could sell him a motorcycle cheap at RM700.00. Gopi
gave him Abang Mat’s mobile phone number, which was 0103805050. The second accused told him that he needed to see the
motorcycle first.
[84] On the 12 January 2014, Abang Mat messaged him asking
‘macam mana harga”. He did not respond. He denied ever
contacting Suffian to supply five kilograms of drugs. He also
claimed that Gopi had contacted him and urged him to buy the
motorcycle using some other numbers, namely 010-3771957 and
019-4623422.
[85] The second accused had agreed to meet Gopi at the TF
supermarket on the 13 January 2014. He had asked the first
accused’s help, as he had no transportation. Suffian, the second
accused claimed, was there but seated in a car. There were no
discussions about drugs, They had only discussed about the
motorcycle.
[86] The man named Abang Mat then came with an EX5 motorcycle.
The second accused claimed to been surprised at the asking
price of RM700.00 as the motorcycle had looked new, but
Abang Mat told him that it was a stolen motorcycle. The second
accused did not agree to buy, but was then assured by Gopi that
he would bring the second accused’s motorcycle the following
day.
[87] The next day at around 2.30 p.m. the second accused went with
the first accused to the TF supermarket, and waited at the

29



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

parking lot. Gopi was not there. Only Suffian was. Suffian told
him that he could get a motorcycle for him. They waited until
4.00 p.m. but Gopi only came at 4.30 p.m. He did not come with
the motorcycle as promised, but told the second accused that
someone would come with it later. Gopi then left. The first
accused too left to pick up his wife.
[88] A while later Gopi sent a message that stated “bro..cukup pukul
7 tadak sampai..saya chow”. Gopi came back at around 7.00
p.m. and parked his motorcycle at a distance. The second
accused asked Gopi about the message that he had received, and
was told that Gopi had merely forwarded to him the message
that he had sent to his friend that was supposed to have come
with the motorcycle.
[89] The first accused came back, and was told by Gopi to park his
motorcycle next to his. Gopi told the second accused that his
motorcycle would arrive in about ten minutes. He then told both
the first and second accused to go over to Suffian to discuss.
The first accused had left his mobile phone in his motorcycle’s
basket, while the second accused loaned his mobile phone to
Gopi, as the latter claimed that he had run out of prepaid credit.
They then walked over to Suffian’s car and were arrested by the
police.
[90] The second accused claimed that the messages between him and
Gopi for the period 1 January 2014 to 14 January 2014 were not
contained in SP6’s report. One of it was a message that read
‘motor awak on the way. Tunggu” from the number 0103770089. He also claimed that there were some calls and
messages that Gopi had sent using the numbers 010-2770089,
019-4623422, 014-6018413 and that these numbers were not in
the report. He also claimed to have struggled when being

30



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

apprehended by the police, as he was caught from behind, and
that it was dark then.
[91] The second accused had also called upon SD-4, a registration
officer from the Larut, Matang & Selama National Registration
Department to give evidence. SD4 was referred to the death
certificate of Gopi and confirmed its authenticity.
[92] The final witness called by the second accused was his sister,
SD5, a housewife. Her husband works as a lorry driver. She
claimed that Gopi had called her on the day that the second
accused was arrested, and that he had offered to procure his
release, subject to being paid RM100,000.00. Gopi claimed to
know the police officer concerned, and could get favours. SD5
claimed that she could only raise RM70,000.00 and that this sum
was paid to Gopi, but nothing came out of it.
Duty of the court at the end of the conclusion of the trial
[93] At the conclusion of the trial, the court will need to adhere to
the provisions of s. 182A CPC, which states as follows:182A – Procedure at the conclusion of the trial
(1)

At the conclusion of the trial, the Court shall consider all
the evidence adduced before it and shall decide whether
the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable
doubt.

(2)

If the Court finds that the prosecution has proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt, the Court shall find the accused
guilty and he may be convicted on it.

31

(3)

Legal Network Series

If the Court finds that the prosecution has not proved its
case beyond reasonable doubt, the Court shall record an
order of acquittal.

[94] Although the burden lies on the prosecution throughout the trial
to prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, no similar
burden is placed on the accused to prove his innocence, as he is
presumed innocent until proven guilty. An accused merely need
to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case for an
acquittal; s. 182A CPC; PP v. Abdul Rahman bin Akif [2007] 5
MLJ 1.
[95] It is also incumbent upon the court to consider and critically
analyse all the evidence produced, be it the prosecution’s or the
defence; Prasit Punyang v. PP [2014] 4 MLJ 282 (CA); Zulkefly
Had v. PP [2014] 6 CLJ 64 (CA).
[96] In PP v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar (supra), the Federal Court in
approving Mat v. PP [1963] MLJ 263, held that the following
steps should be followed, at the end of the defence’s case:(a) If you are satisfied beyond

Analysis of the defence
[97] The first accused’s defence in essence is that of an innocent
bystander. He claimed to have been a victim of circumstances,
in that he was merely present with the second accused to help a
friend in need of transportation. The first accused also denied
being involved in trafficking in the seized drugs, in that the
meetings that the second accused had with SP1, pertained to the
second accused’s attempt to retrieve his motorcycle, which had
been repossessed. Central to this issue is a character named
Gopi, whom the second accused claimed was the person who had
repossessed his motorcycle, and had offered to retrieve it for
him at a price.
[98] Similar to the first accused, the second accused’s defence in
essence is also focused on the character named Gopi. He claimed
that all the meetings that SP1 had referred to were primarily
between him and Gopi, and that the purposes of the meeting
were for the retrieval of his motorcycle. The second accused
also claimed that there were some calls and messages in the

33

Legal Network Series

mobile phones retrieved that were not produced in SP6’s report.
These details would have supported his claim. In essence, the
second accused claimed that he was entrapped, and that he was
entirely innocent of the charges levelled against him.
[99] It was also submitted that SP1 and SP7 had been involved in a
previous drug bust, where Gopi was alleged as the informer. The
prosecution subsequently withdrew the case against the person
arrested in that case. Learned counsel for the second accused
attempted to show the similarity between the previous case and
this case, in that Gopi was the informer and was in the business
of setting up others so that the police could then arrest them for
trafficking. It was submitted that Gopi had played an active role
beyond that of an informer. This would mean that Gopi took an
active participation in the transaction, and had set up to entrap
both the first and second accused, in cohorts with the police.
[100] I have great difficulty in accepting the both accused’s version of
events, in particular on the existence of a man named Gopi. I
took note of the undisputed fact that Gopi is dead. For this
reason, Gopi could not have been procured to give evidence in
court. To accept the accused’s version would simply mean that
the police had planned to entrap two innocent persons with the
help of Gopi. I find it incredible to believe that the police are
capable of doing so. I am not for once suggesting that policemen
are incapable of committing wrongs, but to conclude that the
police had made an elaborate plan to entrap two innocent
persons, and make them suffer the consequence of being hanged
for something that they have not done, is quite simply
outrageous.
[101] It is settled law, that an agent provocateur’s credit is presumed
to be worthy, and that any statements made to him in the course

34

of the transaction is admissible as evidence; s. 40A DDA 1952;
Hari Bahadur Gale v. PP [2011] 5 MLJ 785.
[102] SP1 in my observation was steadfast in giving evidence. As one
would expect, he was subjected to intense cross-examination by
counsel for both accused. Never once did SP1 flinch. I saw no
signs or evidence that had the effect of doubting his credibility.
I have as such chosen to believe and accept SP1’s testimony
above that of the first and second accused.
[103] On this basis, I also reject the evidence of SD5, who claimed to
have been in touch with Gopi, where the latter had allegedly
demanded money to procure the second accused’s release. I also
noted that SD5 had never made any report pertaining to this
allegation. If there is any semblance of truth to her allegation,
one would expect her to make a report to alert the police. Her
brother after all, was facing the gallows if found guilty.
[104] The first accused in his witness statement, claimed that he had
first accompanied the second accused in the meeting on the 6
January 2014. The second accused on the other hand, claimed
that he first met SP1, and allegedly Gopi on the 4 January 2014.
The first impression that one gets is that the second accused had
met SP1 for the first time on the 4 January 2014 without the first
accused. However this was not the case, as counsel for the
second accused had in cross-examining SP1 put forward the
following questions:4.

Tomyam?
Ya.

Pada 6/1/2014, itu adalah perjumpaan pertama kamu dan
kedua-dua OKT?
Ya.

[105] The discrepancy here is telling. It could only mean that the
second accused’s version contained in his witness statement was
a lie. His credibility is questionable.
[106] As for the first accused, who claimed ignorance of the
transactions, SP1 had maintained that the first accused was
always next to the second accused every time they met. On the
day of the arrest, SP1 maintained that the first accused was next
to the second accused when SP1 showed them the cash.
Although the first accused had left on his own for a couple of
hours, he came back and left together with the second accused.
They both came back forty-five minutes later with the drugs.
According to SP1, the first accused was next to the second
accused when the drugs were shown.
[107] It is my finding that the first accused was involved with the
second accused in the transaction. It is highly incredible for him
not to have heard and knew what the conversation between SP1
and the second accused was about. He was present every time
SP1 met the second accused. The first accused had also left with
the second accused, and came back together with the drugs on
the day concerned. It is safe to conclude that the first accused
and the second accused worked hand-in-hand.
[108] I have given great care in analysing the testimony of the first
accused and his wife SD2. The latter had in her witness
statement claimed that the first accused had sent and fetch her
from work. This runs contrary to her statement to the police,

36



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

where she stated that she had gone and came back from work on
her own.
[109] I detected some inconsistency in her testimony. Under crossexamination, prior to the prosecution’s move to impeach her,
SD2 claimed that the first accused was at home when she
arrived. The relevant transcription of her cross are as follows:33.

Pada hari tersebut kamu pulang rumah sekitar 3.30 p.m?
Saya balik kerja antara 3.30 p.m hingga 3.45 p.m.

34.

Apabila kamu pulang ke rumah, kamu tak nampak OKT 1
berada di rumah?
Dia ada di rumah.

35.

Maksud kamu, bila kamu sampai,dia ada di rumah?
Ya.

[110] Now if indeed the first accused had gone to fetch her from work
and sent her back, why would the first accused be at home when
she arrived at her house? To my mind, this could only mean that
SD2 was not telling the truth. She was so intent on testifying in
favour of her husband, that she was caught being inconsistent. It
is only natural that a wife would want to do what is best for the
husband, particularly if he was facing the gallows. Nevertheless,
that does not excuse her from telling the truth.
[111] I also find that there is no credible evidence to suggest that
SD2’s statement to the police was inaccurate, allegedly due to
stress. The questions put forward to her were innocuous and
easy. How much duress can one be put under when questioned
about which vehicle she used, and what she had done for the
day. It would have perhaps been different if she had been one of
37



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

the suspects, and that many probing questions were posed to her.
On the contrary, the questions put to her were simple and few.
[112] I also do not find any merits to her contention that she was not
given an interpreter when making the statement. The language
used was Bahasa Malaysia. SD2 is also fairly young. She was
only twenty-nine years old at that time. Seeing that she was
gainfully employed as a Guest Service Assistant at a hotel, she
would have had education in this country, and that Bahasa
Malaysia would be one of the subjects that she had taken. I find
it very difficult to believe that a young person such as SD2 has
difficulty understanding simple Bahasa Malaysia. I must add
that she had initialled on every page and signed on the final
page of the statement agreeing that the statement given was
accurate and the truth.
[113] On that basis, I therefore rule that SD2’s testimony is to be
impeached. The consequence is that SD2’s credibility is
unworthy, and her evidence in court becomes worthless; see
Matthew Lim v. Game Warden Pahang [1960] 1 MLJ 89. I will
as such not consider SD2’s testimony.
[114] Learned counsel for the second accused submitted that SP1’s
phone number that was used to contact the second accused was
not disclosed by the prosecution. This is clearly inaccurate.
Evidence has been led to show that the mobile phone used by
SP1 had also been seized and forwarded to SP7 (exhibit P-18D),
who subsequently forwarded it to SP6. The data from SP1’s
mobile phone was also extracted by SP6 and produced in his
report (exhibit P-27). SP6 had testified that the messages from
SP1’s mobile phone were sent and received by the second
accused’s mobile phone. This lends credence to the

38



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

prosecution’s case that SP1 had in been in touch with the second
accused pertaining to the drug transaction.
[115] The second accused put much reliance on the fact that the
reports by SP6 were incomplete, and that there were several
numbers used by Gopi to contact the second accused. It was
submitted that this will prove that Gopi had exceeded his role as
an informer by pIaying an active role, and that he loses the
protection pursuant to s. 40 DDA 1952. It was submitted that the
prosecution’s failure to call him as a witness is therefore fatal.
[116] I do not find any credence to this proposition. Firstly, it is
undeniable that Gopi is dead. In any event, as I have stated
earlier, I rejected the proposition that Gopi was actively
involved in setting up both the accused.
[117] I have chose not to accept SD5’s allegation that Gopi had
procured RM70,000.00 to procure the second accused’ release.
This allegation to my mind was merely an afterthought. It was
never raised during the prosecution’s case.
[118] The second accused’s contention that he had put up a struggle
when being arrested, as it was dark and that he was caught from
behind is clearly baseless. The first accused’s learned counsel
had when cross-examining SP1 suggested that the area was well
lighted, to which SP1 agreed. This was not rebutted. The
relevant transcript is as follows:23.

Setuju dengan saya keadaan di kawasan tersebut cerah
dengan lampu?
Setuju.

[119] I also find that both accused has failed to raise any reasonable
doubt as to their involvement to negate the provisions of s. 34
39



[2017] 1 LNS 1804

Legal Network Series

Penal Code. Both accused were involved from the onset. The
acts committed by both of them satisfy the provisions of s. 34
PC.
Decision
[120] I have conducted a maximum evaluation of both accused’s
evidence and that of the prosecution’s. It is this court’s findings,
that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt
against both accused, and that they have failed to raise any
reasonable doubt as to the prosecution’s case.
[121] I therefore find both accused guilty of the charge, and sentence
them to death by hanging, as prescribed by the law.
