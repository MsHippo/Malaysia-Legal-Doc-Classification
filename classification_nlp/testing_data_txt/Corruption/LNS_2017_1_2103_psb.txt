JUDGMENT
Background
[1] The accused was charged with an offence under section 17(a) of
the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 punishable under
section 24 of the same Act. At the end of the case for the prosecution,
the learned Sessions Court Judge found that the prosecution has failed
to prove a prima facie case. The accused was acquitted and discharged
at the end of the case for the prosecution.
[2] The prosecution was not satisfied with the acquittal and discharge
of the accused at the end of the prosecution’s case and appealed to the
High Court. On appeal, the High Court allowed the appeal by the
3



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

prosecution and reversed the decision of the learned Sessions Court
Judge. The accused was ordered to enter his defence. In his defence,
the accused elected to give evidence under oath. At the end of the case
for the defence, the learned Sessions Court Judge decided that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. The accused was acquitted and discharged. The
prosecution was not satisfied with the decision of the learned Sessions
Court Judge and appeals to this court against the acquittal and
discharge. In this judgment, reference to the prosecution and the
accused will remain.
[3] After evaluating the record of appeal and considering the
arguments and submissions of the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor
and defence counsel, I allowed the appeal by the prosecution and
reverse the decision of the learned Sessions Court Judge. I hold the
considered view that the prosecution has succeeded in proving the case
against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused has
failed to raise any doubt in the prosecution’s case. I allowed the appeal
by the prosecution and the accused was accordingly convicted and
sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and RM10,000.00 fine in default
3 months imprisonment. The accused is not satisfied with the decision
and filed an appeal. This is the grounds for my decision.
The prosecution’s case
[4] The charge against the respondent under section 17(a) of the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 reads“Bahawa kamu pada 9 Januari jam lebih kurang 0020 hrs,
bertempat di Perhentian Bas berhadapan Dengan Hospital Kepala
Batas, dalam Daerah Seberang Perai Utara, Dalam Negeri Pulau
Pinang sebagai seorang ejen Kerajaan Malaysia, iaitu Lans

Perai Utara telah secara rasuah memperoleh untuk diri kamu satu
suapan iaitu, wang tunai RM200.00 daripada Nazri Bin Sabu,
sebagai dorongan untuk melakukan suatu perbuatan berhubung
dengan hal ehwal prinsipal kamu, iaitu memasukkan roti canai
dan rokok ke dalam Lokap Central Ibupejabat Polis Daerah
Seberang Perai Utara kepada Ena Saiful Al Amin Bin Nazri dan
dengan itu kamu telah melakukan satu kesalahan di bawah
seksyen 17(a) Akta Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia
2009 dan boleh dihukum di bawah seksyen 24 Akta yang sama.”.
[5] According to the prosecution, PW3 received a complaint from one
Nazri Bin Sabu (PW6) on 08.01.2012. The complainant’s son was
detained at the Central Lock-Up at the Seberang Perai Utara police
headquarters (“IPD Seberang Perai Utara”). The complainant gave
evidence that the day before (07.01.2012), he received a call from
someone that his son had asked for some roti canai to be sent to the
Central Lock-Up, IPD Seberang Perai Utara.
[6] The complainant was given a number to call. When he called up
the number, he managed to speak to a man who said that if he wanted
to send the roti canai to his son at the lock-up, he must pay RM200.00
on 07.01.2012 at about 10:00 pm. The complainant later called up the
number again and tried to excuse himself by telling the man that he
does not have the money and asked for time. The man told the
complainant to pay the money the next day (08.01.2012) at 12:00
midnight.
[7] PW6’s son (PW1), who was detained at the Central LockUp IPD
Seberang Perai Utara, confirmed that it was the accused who had asked
for RM200.00 from him when he asked the accused to allow his father
(PW6) to send roti canai to him in the lock-up. According to PW1, after
PW1 told the accused that he had wanted his father to send him roti
canai, the accused had brought him to an alleyway towards the women’s

5



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

lock-up for PW1 to call his father. At this time, the accused told PW1
to ask his father to send RM200.00 as well being the “upah” for the
accused to bring in food into the lock-up for PW1. PW1 used a cell
phone given by the accused and made call to his friend “Kaon”. PW1
cannot remember his father’s telephone number and had asked “Kaon”
to inform his father to return his call using the same number as that of
the cell phone which the accused gave him to use. Moments later, the
accused’s sister, Ena Nurul Samira, called. PW1 told his sister that he
wanted to speak to their father and for their father to return call using
the same number. PW1 then hung up. PW1 waited for this father to call
but there was no call then. PW1 later returned to the lock-up.
[8] After PW1 was back in the lock-up, the accused had a chat with
him in front of the lock-up. PW1 then heard the accused’s cell phone
rang and the accused went away from PW1, presumably to answer the
call. Within a few minutes, the accused returned to PW1 and told PW1
that PW1’s father could not come that day. He will come tomorrow.
[9] Based on the complaint, PW3 and other officers from the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission held a briefing and set up a
trap. Arrangements were also made to have telephone conversations
between the complainant and the targeted man recorded. The RM200.00
trap money was prepared and the serial numbers for the RM200.00
marked notes were taken down and recorded. The RM200.00 was later
handed over to the complainant.
[10] On 08.01.2012 at about 11:15 pm, PW3 and his team together
with the complainant reached the rendezvous point at a bus stop near
Hospital Kepala Batas. PW4 took the complainant to a nearby nasi
kandar restaurant and bought roti canai, teh tarik and a pack of 20s
Dunhill cigarettes and gave them to the complainant. They waited. The
accused did not come. PW3 gave instructions for the complainant to
call up the accused.

[11] The complainant called up the accused and the accused told the
complainant to wait. At about 12:20 midnight, the accused came to the
rendezvous point driving a Proton Waja. The complainant delivered the
package containing the roti canai, teh tarik and cigarettes and also
handed to the accused the RM200.00 marked notes. When the accused
was about to leave the scene, PW3 drove his car towards the accused’s
car and intercepted it. The package containing the roti canai, teh tarik
and cigarettes was found inside the accused’s car. The RM200.00
marked note was also found on the accused. The accused was arrested.
[12] The recorded telephone conversation between the accused and the
complainant was transcribed and tendered as Exhibit P8. For a better
appreciation of the case for the prosecution and the defence, it is useful
to reproduce the transcribed recorded telephone conversation.
According to the complainant, Voice A is him and Voice B is the
accused. From the transcribed recorded telephone conversation, the
complainant identified the accused’s voice at paragraph 10. The
transcribed recorded telephone conversation (Exhibit P8) reads“Suara A: Hello Assalamualaikum

[13] After the prosecution closes, the learned Sessions Court Judge
finds that the prosecution has failed to prove a prima facie case against
the accused and had acquitted and discharged the accused without his
defence being called. On appeal by the prosecution, the High Court
allowed the appeal by the prosecution and reversed the decision of the
learned Sessions Court Judge. The accused was ordered to enter his
defence. In his defence, the accused elected to give evidence under
oath.

The defence’s case
[14] In his defence, the accused (SD1) gave evidence that in the year
2012, he was attached to the Central Lock-Up at IPD Seberang Perai
Utara. While on duty a day before he was arrested, he met one of the
detainees at the lock-up named Saiful Al Amin (“Saiful”) and had a
chat. Saiful had asked the accused to get him roti canai. Saiful had also
asked the accused to allow him to speak to his father and with the
accused’s help, Saiful managed to call his father from the lock-up. The
accused had given Saiful a cell phone for him to call his father. After
briefly talking to his father on the cell phone, Saiful handed it to the
accused and the accused talk to Saiful’s father. According to the
accused, in the telephone conversation between the accused and
Saiful’s father, Saiful’s father had requested the accused to deliver roti
canai and cigarettes to Saiful in the lock-up.
[15] On the date in question, the accused was on duty for the 12:00
midnight to 8:00 am shift. Later, the accused received a call from
Saiful’s father. In the telephone conversation, Saiful’s father asked the
accused to pick up the roti canai and cigarettes from him at a bus stop
near Hospital Kepala Batas. The accused later took his car and went to
meet up with Saiful’s father at the appointed place.
[16] According to the accused, upon arrival at the bus stop a male
Malay came over to his car and gave him the roti canai and cigarettes
in a package. There was also money together with the roti canai and
cigarettes but according to the accused, he did not know how much it
was at that time. As he was making his way back, suddenly his car was
blocked by another car. A group of men got out of that car and
introduced themselves as officers from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission. The officers seized the package given by Saiful’s father
and the accused was arrested. According to the accused, it is not his
duty to bring the roti canai and cigarettes to the detainee. It is also not

11

Legal Network Series

part of police work. The accused added that a disciplinary action could
be taken against him by his superiors if he got caught. The accused
maintained that the act is a disciplinary offence but it bears no relation
to police work.
[17] At the end of the defence’s case, the learned Sessions Court Judge
again acquitted and discharged the accused after finding that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt
because the prosecution has failed to prove that the delivery of roti
canai and 20s pack of cigarettes to the detainee in the Central Lock-Up
IPD Seberang Perai Utara is not an act in relation to the affairs of the
accused’s principal.
The decision of the trial court
[18] In acquitting and discharging the accused at the end of the
defence case, the learned Sessions Court Judge made a maximum
evaluation of the totality evidence presented by the prosecution and
finds that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt. The learned Sessions Court Judge
made a finding that the act of taking roti canai and cigarettes by the
accused to PW1 who was detained in the lock-up is not related to the
affairs of the accused’s principal. The learned Sessions Court Judge
also made a finding that the accused was a truthful witness and gave
evidence that he received the RM200.00 from PW6 to deliver the roti
canai and cigarettes by the accused to PW1 who was detained in the
lockup.
[19] The learned Sessions Court Judge further made a finding that the
presumption under section 19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti Corruption
Commission Act 2009 has the effect of restricting the accused’s
defence. As such, its use by the prosecution has, in effect, destroyed
the defence’s case and the accused lost the opportunity to reconstruct
his defence on a new footing. The learned Sessions Court Judge hasten
12



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

to add that he was not making a declaration that section 19(1)(d) of the
Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission Act 2009 is unconstitutional
but that the accused’s defence was effectively rebutted by section
19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009.
The deliberation
The prosecution’s arguments
[20] The prosecution contends that since the High Court has reversed
the decision of the learned Sessions Court Judge at the end of the
prosecution’s case and ordered the accused to enter his defence, it is
impliedly understood to mean that the High Court found that the
prosecution has succeeded in proving a prima facie case against the
accused. It follows that where a prima facie case has been proved
against the accused, the rebuttable presumption under section 50(1) of
the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 applies unless
the contrary is proved, namely that the gratification has been corruptly
obtained as an inducement or a reward for the matters set out in the
charge. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor refers to the decision of
the Privy Council in the case of Public Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj [1969] 2
MLJ 89 PC; [1968] 1 LNS 115 which was based on the repealed
Prevention of Corruption Act 1961whereby it was observed as follows:
“Where a defendant is charged with an offence under section 4(a)
of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961, to which section 14
also applied, the onus lies upon the prosecution to prove the first
two factual ingredients of the offence viz. (1) that a gratification
was paid or given to or received by the defendant and (2) that at
the time of the payment, gift or receipt he was in the employment
of a public body. Upon proof of these two ingredients the
existence of the third ingredient, viz. (3) that the gratification was
paid or given or received corruptly as an inducement or reward
for doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to the affairs of
13



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

that public body, is to be presumed “unless the contrary is
proved”.
[21] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor contends that once the
statutory rebuttable presumption under section 50(1) of the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 applies, the onus is on the
accused to rebut the presumption of a balance of probabilities that he
did not obtained the gratification corruptly as decided in the case of
Thavanathan a/l Balasubramaniam v. PP [1997] 3 CLJ 150; [1997] 2
MLJ 401 SC; [1997] 3 AMR 2289. The learned Deputy Public
Prosecutor further contends that the explanation given by the accused
must be one which is reasonably sufficient to invite belief in its
probable truth to rebut the presumption under section 50(1) of the
Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009 as decided in the case
of Attan Bin Abdul Ghani v. PP [1969] 1 LNS 12; [1970] 2 MLJ 143 in
the words of His Lordship Sharma J. (as he then was) as follows:
“The presumption cannot be said to have been rebutted without
sufficient evidence, i.e. such evidence as is reasonably sufficient
to invite belief in its probable truthfulness.”.
[22] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor submits that the accused’s
defence has in fact bolstered the prosecution’s case and that the learned
Sessions Court Judge had erred when he finds that the prosecution has
failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt in light of such a
defence put forth by the accused. The fact that the accused received
RM200.00 from PW6 to deliver roti canai and cigarettes to PW6’s son
(PW1) who was detained at the Central Lock-Up IPD Seberang Perai
Utara is in not dispute by the defence.
[23] The crux of the defence is that the act of taking roti canai and
cigarettes to PW1 who at the time was detained at the Central Lock-Up
IPD Seberang Perai Utara is not part of police duties and as such it
cannot be an act in relation to his principal’s affairs. This line of
14



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

defence when viewed in light of the burden cast upon the defence to
offer an explanation which is “reasonably sufficient to invite belief in
its probable truthfulness” as per Attan Bin Abdul Ghani (supra) and the
factual matrix of the prosecution’s case including the receipt by the
accused of the RM200.00 marked notes is not capable to rebut the
presumption under section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor contends
that the defence is bare denial at best and there is no evidence to
support the accused’s denial.
[24] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor further argues that it is
clear that the accused had corruptly obtained the RM200.00 from PW6.
The accused in cross-examination said“Ya, saya ambil roti canai dan rokok.
Ya, roti canai dan rokok adalah untuk Saiful.
Ya, kalau SPRM tidak tangkap saya, rokok dan roti canai saya
akan serah kepada Saiful.”,
and this is evidence of the intention of the accused to perpetuate the
forbidden act. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor refers to the case
of PP v. Datuk Haji Harun Bin Haji Idris (No. 2) [1977] 1 MLJ 15;
[1976] 1 LNS 184 whereby His Royal Highness, the late Raja Azlan
Shah FJ (as he then was) observed“Corrupt” means “doing an act knowing that the act done is
wrong, doing so with evil feelings and evil intentions.” (see Lim
Kheng Kooi v. Reg [1957] MLJ 199); “purposely doing an act
which the law forbids” (see R v. Smith [1960] 1 All ER 256).
“Corrupt” is a question of intention. If the circumstances show
that what a person has done or has omitted to do was moved by
an evil intention or a guilty mind, then he is liable under the

15



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

section. Thus if the accused used his position to solicit
gratification with a guilty mind, he is caught within the ambit of
the section.”.
[25] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor submits that the accused
has failed to rebut the presumption of corruptly received gratification
under section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act
2009 as the act of taking the roti canai and cigarettes to PW1 in the
lock-up are clearly against the Lock-Up Rules 1953 as confirmed by
PW9 in evidence. It is also an incontrovertible fact that when a person
is detained in a lock-up, his movements and liberty are restricted
including the food which he may take being the subject of regulation
by the authority in charge of the lock-up. When the accused attempted
to bring in the roti canai and cigarettes illegally and secures a monetary
benefit for doing it, that is clearly a wrongful act which could not, on
any account, be taken as being capable to rebut the presumption section
50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009.
[26] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor further argues that the
learned Sessions Court Judge ought not to have made the same findings
at the close of the case for the defence as that which he has made at the
end of the prosecution’s case when his decision at the end of the
prosecution’s case has been reversed by the High Court on appeal. The
effect would be that the learned Sessions Court had acquitted and
discharged the accused at the close of the case for the defence on the
same exact reasons he did so at the end of the prosecution’s case. In
the case of Saad Abas & Anor v. PP [1998] 4 CLJ 575; [1999] 1 MLJ
129 CA is instructive of the role of the Sessions Court Judge in such a
situation whereby the Court of Appeal observed as follows:
“Similarly, when a High Court judge rules at the end of an appeal
by the prosecutor in a case where the accused has been acquitted
at the end of the prosecution case that the accused must enter his

16



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

defence, it is as good as saying that the Sessions Court Judge
himself has decided to call for the defence assuming that he has
analysed the case in the way that the High Court Judge has done.”
[27] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor also refers to the decision
of the Court of Appeal in the case of Manimaran a/l Amas v. Public
Prosecutor [2014] 1 LNS 1412; [2015] 1 MLJ 18 CA whereby Her
Ladyship Tengku Maimun Binti Tuan Mat JCA, speaking for the Court
of Appeal, made the following observations:
“In the instant appeal, since all the appellants were called upon
by the Court of Appeal to enter on their defence, it must
necessarily mean that the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the
prosecution had proved all the ingredients of the charge,
including the element of common intention, before concluding
that a prima facie case had been made out by the prosecution.
There was therefore no necessity for us to revisit the issues on
whether a prima facie case had been made out. What we need to
consider was whether the evidence from the defence had cast a
reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case.”,
and contends that the learned Sessions Court Judge should not have
continued to rely to his earlier findings at the end of the prosecution’s
case since the High Court was satisfied that the prosecution has
succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against the accused. What
the learned Sessions Court Judge should indulge in at the defence stage
is to consider whether the accused has succeeded in rebutting the
presumption on a balance of probabilities.
[28] It was also argued by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor that
the learned Sessions Court Judge erred in fact when he finds that the
act of taking the roti canai and cigarettes to PW1 who was detained in
the lock-up is not an act in relation to the accused principals’ affairs
by considering the evidence of PW2, the Head of Administration
17



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

Division at IPD Seberang Perai Utara. The learned Deputy Public
Prosecutor compares PW1’s evidence with that of the accused himself
who agreed in cross-examination that he is responsible to supervise
movements of food in the lock-up. The accused in various parts of the
cross-examination said“Ya, saya bertanggungjawab mengawal selia keluar masuk
makanan.
Ya, pergerakan keluar masuk makanan adalah diselia di bawah
Kaedah-Kaedah Lokap.
Ya, berpandukan Kaedah-Kaedah ini, makanan tidak boleh sesuka
hati dibawa masuk ke lokap.
Ya, saya bertanggungjawab untuk mematuhi kehendakkehendak
lokap.
Ya, Kaedah-Kaedah ini terpakai untuk keluar masuk makanan di
dalam lokap.
Ya, saya bertanggungjawab untuk mengikuti Kaedah-Kaedah
ini.”.
[29] It is the submission of the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor that
the evidence is clear that the act of taking the roti canai and cigarettes
relate to the accused principal’s affairs and that the accused had the
authority to supervise them. Based on Rule 3(1) of the Lock-Up Rules
1953, the supervision and general administration of lock-ups and its
security by police officers in charge of the lock-ups or placed at the
lock-ups are vested in the Chief Police Officer. Rules 15, 16 and 17 of
the Lock-Up Rules 1953 are further evidence of the fact that food shall
not be freely supplied to detainees.

[30] The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor contends that the learned
Sessions Court Judge fell into error when he made a finding that section
19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 has
the effect of restricting the accused’s defence and his finding that that
provision cannot be so used for the reasons aforesaid runs contrary to
the very intent and purpose of section 19(1)(d). The learned Deputy
Public Prosecutor refers to the decision of His Lordship Abdul Wahab
Patail J. (as he then was) whereby the use of presumption in corruption
cases under the then Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 was discussed.
The High Court in that case observed that use of the presumption is not
at the discretion of the trial judge and that the court could not change
the meaning of clear and unambiguous provisions of the law. His
Lordship Abdul Wahab Patail J. (as he then was) said“The first rule of interpretation is to apply the literal or the plain
meaning of the words used as best conveying the intention of
Parliament, and where the language of the Act is clear and
explicit, the courts must give effect to it. This principle is well
established: see Salomon v. Salomon [1897] AC 22, 38; Sutters
v. Briggs [1922] 1 AC 1, 8.”.
The defence’s arguments
[31] The learned defence counsel contends that the act of taking the
roti canai and cigarettes to PW1 in the lock-up is not an act in relation
to the accused principal’s affairs and as such it cannot be an offence
under section 17(a) of the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commissions Act
2009. It is also the crux of the defence’s case that for the same reason,
section 50(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commissions Act
2009 do not apply.
[32] According to the learned defence counsel, the act of taking the
roti canai and cigarettes to PW1 in the lock-up will only subject the
accused to disciplinary proceedings but not an offence of corruption as
19



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

contemplated by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commissions Act
2009. The learned defence counsel reasoned that it is not the duty of
police personnel to give “extra goodies” to prisoners in the lock-up and
if they do, they would only be put on inquiry in an orderly room in
accordance with police procedures.
[33] The learned defence counsel relied heavily of the evidence of
PW2, the Head of Administration Division at IPD Seberang Perai
Utara, who said in evidence that such an act is not an act in relation to
the accused principal’s affairs. The learned defence counsel also relied
on the evidence of PW1 and his father, PW6, who said that the
RM200.00 was meant as an “upah” for the accused to bring the roti
canai and cigarettes to PW1 who was detained in the lock-up and that
by the analogy that the act of taking the roti canai and cigarettes to
PW1 in the lock-up is not an act in relation to the accused principal’s
affairs, the payment of RM200.00 “upah” could not amount to
corruption.
[34] The learned defence counsel also questions the credibility of
PW9’s evidence being in direct contrast to that of PW2 when PW9 said
in evidence that no one is allowed to bring in any food or drinks into
the lock-up because it contravenes the lock-up rules. PW2 is a much
superior officer compared to PW9 who is a rankand-file and as such,
PW2’s evidence should hold better credit as far as the determination of
what are the affairs of the accused’s principal is concerned.
[35] The learned defence counsel submits that the presumption under
section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009
is a rebuttable presumption and that the burden on the accused to rebut
the presumption is only on the balance of probabilities. The learned
defence counsel refers to the case of Nagappan a/l Kuppusamy v.
Public Prosecutor [1988] 2 MLJ 53 SC; [1988] 1 CLJ 283 whereby it
was observed that-

20



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

“Where the burden is shifted to the defence by a statutory
presumption, the test in R v. Carr Briant [1943] KB 607 and
adopted in Public Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj [1969] 2 MLJ 89 would
be applied as applied in civil proceedings, namely, on the balance
of probabilities.”.
[36] According to the learned defence counsel, the prosecution need
not prove that the act of the accused was done in relation to his
principal’s affairs because once the prosecution has proven that the
accused received the money, which is not disputed in this case, the
presumption under section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti Corruption
Commission Act 2009 applies.
[37] It is contended that the presumption under section 50(1) of the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 may be rebutted by
the accused from the evidence adduced during the prosecution’s case
itself and this has been successfully done by the accused by means of
the evidence of PW2. The learned defence counsel refers to the case of
PP v. Adetunji Adeleye Sule [1993] 2 MLJ 70 SC; [1993] 3 CLJ 113;
[1993] 1 AMR 991 whereby His Lordship Edgar Joseph Jr. SCJ (as he
then was) observed that“Lest we be accused of an oversight, we have not overlooked the
principle that where a statutory presumption is raised against an
accused person, so that the legal burden of proof is imposed on
him, he may rebut this presumption either by adducing evidence
during the case for the defence or by pointing to evidence in the
case for the prosecution. What we have said in this judgment does
not in any way, conflict with this principle and, indeed, is entirely
consistent with it.”.
[38] The learned defence counsel also contends that this burden to
rebut the presumption is a light burden and can be discharged either
during the prosecution’s case or the defence’s case. The learned
21



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

defence counsel refers to the case of Public Prosecutor v. Mohamed
Noor Jantan [1979] 2 MLJ 80 FC as authority whereby it was held that“It is a well settled rule of evidence as Azmi C.J. (Malaya) (as he
then was) held in Wong Chooi v. Public Prosecutor [1967] 2 MLJ
180 that where a burden is placed on an accused person to prove
anything, by statute or common law, the burden is only a slight
one and this burden can be discharged by evidence of witnesses
for the prosecution as well as witnesses for the defence.”.
[39] The learned defence counsel contends that the rebuttal has been
successfully brought about by the evidence of PW2 during the
prosecution’s case and that the accused should not have been called
upon to enter his defence. The learned defence counsel relies on the
case of Woo Chin Chong & Ors. v. Public Prosecutor [1956] MLJ 130;
[1955] 1 LNS 171 whereby it was observed as follows:
“In a case of this nature, where by doing an act a presumption
under the Ordinance is raised against accused persons, if the
prosecution have the evidence which rebuts that presumption in
their possession to the knowledge of the accused persons, but do
not use it, then I think it can be said that no presumption properly
arises against the accused persons, as the prosecution have not
brought out evidence in favour of the accused in their possession
rebutting such presumption which they should have done.”.
[40] The learned defence counsel also submits that section 19(1)(d)of
the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 strikes directly
at section 50(1). According to the learned defence counsel, section
19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009
effectively prevents the accused from contending that the act was not
one which relates to the affairs of the accused’s principal whereas
section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009
allows the accused to rebut the presumption under section 19(1)(d). The
22



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

learned defence counsel contends that section 50(1) of the Malaysian
AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009 conflicts with section 19(1)(d)
and where there is a conflict, the court should adopt the provision
which is more favourable to the accused. The learned defence counsel
refers to the case of Public Prosecutor v. Tan Tatt Eek & Other Appeals
[2005] 2 MLJ 685 FC; [2005] 1 CLJ 713; [2005] 2 AMR 353 whereby
the Federal Court cited the decision in Muhammed Bin Hassan v. Public
Prosecutor [1998] 2 MLJ 273 FC; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR
829 which held that“Also, generally speaking, if the words in a statute admit of two
interpretations, then they are not clear, and if one interpretation
is more favourable to an accused than the other, the court will
adopt the one more favourable to the accused.”.
[41] It is the position taken by the learned defence counsel that section
50 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 prevails
over section 19(1)(d) because the former which allows the presumption
to be rebutted is more favourable to the accused compared to the latter.
[42] The learned defence counsel further echoes the findings of the
learned Sessions Court Judge at the end of the defence case and took
the view that section 19(1)(d)of the Malaysian Anti Corruption
Commission Act 2009 is unconstitutional as it contravenes the
fundamental right of the accused under Article 5(1) and 8(1) of the
Federal Constitution because section 19(1)(d)of the Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009 denied the accused a fair trial. The
learned defence counsel relies on the authority of Gan Boon Aun v. PP
[2016] 4 MLJ 265 FC; [2016] 6 CLJ 647; [2016] 4 AMR 297.

Evaluation and decision
The principles
[43] In respect of the principles of appellate intervention, this court
refers to the observation made by the Federal Court in the case of Tan
Kim Ho & Anor. v. Public Prosecutor [2009] 3 MLJ 151 FC; [2009] 3
CLJ 236 remarked that“It is an established principle of law that when dealing with
finding of facts, the trial judge is more often than not, in a better
position to decide. The appellate court must be reluctant to
interfere with such findings, unless the facts obviously disclose
the courts below had clearly and wrongly evaluated the facts.”.
[44] The principles are clear. Where the decision of the trial court in
acquitting and discharging the accused at the end of the prosecution’s
case is reversed by an appellate court, it is implicit that as a matter of
law, the appellate court found that a prima facie case has in fact been
proved by the prosecution. The only issue for the trial judge to consider
is whether the explanation of the accused in his defence casts a doubt
in the prosecution’s case. (See: Mohd Azam Raja Abdullah v. PP [2015]
MLJU 2128; [2015] 1 CLJ 1080 CA, PP v. Abdul Rehman Abdul
Hameed [2016] MLJU 970 CA; [2017] 1 CLJ 317).
[45] In the case of Balachandran v. Public Prosecutor [2005] 2 MLJ
301 FC; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321, the Federal Court
reiterated the position of the law in the following manner:
“As the accused can be convicted on the prima facie evidence it
must have reached a standard which is capable of supporting a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt. However, it must be
observed that it cannot, at that stage, be properly described as a
case that has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond

24



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

reasonable doubt involves two aspects. While one is the legal
burden on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable
doubt the other is the evidential burden on the accused to raise a
reasonable doubt. Both these burdens can only be fully
discharged at the end of the whole case when the defence has
closed its case. Therefore a case can be said to have been proved
beyond reasonable doubt only at the conclusion of the trial upon
a consideration of all the evidence adduced as provided by s
182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. That would normally
be the position where the accused has given evidence. However,
where the accused remains silent there will be no necessity to reevaluate the evidence in order to determine whether there is a
reasonable doubt in the absence of any further evidence for such
a consideration. The prima facie evidence which was capable of
supporting a conviction beyond reasonable doubt will constitute
proof beyond reasonable doubt.”
[46] At the end of the defence’s case, it is trite that the duty of the
accused is only to cast a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case.
There is no necessity for the accused to prove his innocence beyond
reasonable doubt. (See: Mohd Radhi Bin Yaakob v. PP [1991] 3 MLJ
169 FC; [1991] 1 CLJ (Rep) 311). And in the case of Tan Kim Ho &
Anor. (supra), the Federal Court observed as follows:
“In our adversarial system of justice, the duty of each party is to
show that his case is the truth. This is done by him adducing his
own witnesses to support his contention. When it is the plaintiff
or prosecutor who is adducing the evidence, his witnesses are
subject to cross-examination by the defence or the accused
person. When a prosecution witness makes a statement of fact
which is disagreed to by the defence it becomes the defence’s
duty to, in whatever way, put to the plaintiff or prosecution
witness that what the witness has said is not true. In addition, he
25



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

could also use the plaintiff’s or prosecution’s witnesses to adduce
evidence to support his defence and to indicate what his defence
is. This he is required to do to enable the plaintiff or prosecution
to bring out evidence to disprove what the defence intends to
adduce. If the defence does not in any way indicate by cross
examination of those facts, those statements made by the
plaintiff’s or prosecution’s witnesses must be accepted as true.
Even if the plaintiff’s or prosecution’s witness does not say
anything relating to the defence case, it is still the duty of the
defence to bring out his case during the plaintiff’s or
prosecution’s case. In fact, this duty to disclose his defence
during the prosecution’s case is more relevant in criminal cases
than in civil. This is particularly so when the plaintiff or
prosecution’s witness is relevant to the fact in issue. In criminal
cases, the prosecution does not know what the defence is going
to be, except in alibi, until the defence adduces its evidence.”
Assessment of the defence
[47] In evaluating the case for the defence, I am of the view that the
accused cannot be said to be merely accepting the RM200.00 from the
detainee’s father (PW6) on the date as stated in the charge as a token
of goodwill or “upah” for taking roti canai and a pack of 20s cigarettes
to the detainee in the Central Lock-Up IPD Seberang Perai Utara as
there was evidence of his active involvement in(a)

seeking to establish contact with the detainee’s father
(PW6);

(b)

making a demand from detainee’s father (PW6) for the sum
of RM200.00;

(c)

insisting on payment of the sum of RM200.00 by agreeing
to meet with the detainee’s father (PW6) the following night

26



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

for PW6 to deliver the RM200.00 to the accused after PW6
said that he do not have money when PW6 first talked to the
accused on the cell phone and PW6 asked for time to deliver
the money to the accused; and
(d)

telling PW6 to wait for him because he had clocked in for
duty that night and needed to get time-out permission from
his superior officers before he can go out.

[48] In considering the totality of the accused’s defence, I am of the
considered view that such active involvement perpetrated by the
accused towards the commission of the offence coupled with the fact
that the accused had took it upon himself to go out to an area near a
bus stop in front of Hospital Kepala Batas effectively and conclusively
negates the underlying defence of the accused that he had received the
RM200.00 merely as a token of goodwill or “upah”, as he put it, for
taking roti canai and a pack of 20s cigarettes to the detainee in Central
Lock-Up at IPD Seberang Perai Utara.
[49] I hold the considered view that an act of merely accepting a token
of goodwill or “upah” as suggested by the accused in his defence may
be said to have taken place where the accused is not involved in any
overt act or active participation in relation to the act of accepting of
the token of goodwill or “upah”. This however, is not a finding that an
act of accepting a token of goodwill or “upah” by an accused is an
acceptable defence for a charge under section 17(a) of the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009. As a matter of fact, the word
“upah” itself strongly suggests and closely relates to gratification. In
Kamus Dewan Edisi Keempat, the word “upah” is defined as follows:
“wang dan lain-lain yang diberikan kepada orang yang disuruh
mengerjakan sesuatu, bayaran sebagai pembalas jasa, ganjaran
untuk tenaga orang yang telah digunakan:

27



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

(a)

bekerja dengan mendapat upah;

(b)

menerima upah kerana mengerjakan sesuatu;

(c) menerima rasuah, makan suap; berupah (melakukan
sesuatu) dengan mendapat upah, menerima upah, dengan upah:
mengupah menyuruh membuat sesuatu pekerjaan dengan
membayar upah, menyuruh bekerja dengan memberi upah.”
[50] The accused, by taking the line of defence which he did, would
be out of reasonable explanation if his contention that the taking of roti
canai and cigarettes are found to be in fact acts in relation to his
principal’s affairs. That is exactly the case. The accused is fried by his
own defence.
“any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”
[51] Whether or not the taking of roti canai and cigarettes to detainees
by police personnel in charge of lock-up duties are part of police duties
must be examined in relation to rules applicable to lock-ups. By no
stretch of imagination can it be said that the act of taking roti canai and
cigarettes are part of police duties in charge of lock-up security.
[52] Management of the lock-up and detainees detained in lockups are
very much a regulated affair. The Lock-Up Rules 1953 is testament to
this. In fact, the Lock-Up Rules 1953 specifically regulates the
management of lock-ups including the giving of food and drinks to by
detainees. There are no “tapau” or takeaways for detainees in lock-ups.
This to my mind is the act in relation to the accused principal’s affairs,
namely in complying with the Lock-Up Rules 1953.
[53] With respect, I am also unable to agree with the arguments by the
learned defence counsel that the act of taking of roti canai and
cigarettes could not be an act in relation to the accused principal’s

28



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

affairs simply because PW2, the Head of Administration Division at
IPD Seberang Perai Utara, said in evidence that it is not. I hold the
considered view that the evidence of PW2 is cross-examination as
quoted by the learned defence counsel has been taken in isolation to
the relevant facts of the case and deciphered out of its contextual
meaning. I am of the view that what is meant by the evidence of PW2
that the taking of roti canai and cigarettes is not an act in relation to
the accused principal’s affairs is in relation to the act per se. It is not
an issue that such an act is not in relation to the accused principal’s
affairs. It cannot be. But such an act is a direct contravention of the
duties of the accused in complying with the Lock-Up Rules 1953 and
that, without doubt, is in relation to the accused principal’s affairs. This
is clear from the evidence of PW2 in cross-examination when he said“Ya, saya mahir dengan tugas-tugas dan urusan-urusan polis.
Ya, bukan tugas polis untuk ambil roti canai dan beri kepada
tahanan.
Ya, ia tidak berkaitan dengan urusan polis.”
[54] In fact, this is
counsel elicited from
from the evidence of
Central Lock-Up IPD
in-chief that-

the only evidence which the learned defence
PW2 in his cross-examination as distinguished
PW9, the Supervisor for LockUp Sentry at the
Seberang Perai Utara, who said in examination

“Mengikut peraturan, sesiapa pun tidak boleh bawa makanan atau
minuman di dalam lokap. Ini peraturan lokap.”.
[55] PW9 was not cross-examined at all by the learned defence
counsel. It is incumbent upon the defence to challenge this piece of
evidence if it is intended to form part of the defence and as decided by
the Federal Court in the case of Wong Swee Chin v. Public Prosecutor

29



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

[1981] 1 MLJ 212 FC; [1980] 1 LNS 138, failure to cross-examine a
witness on a crucial part of the case amounts to acceptance of the
witness’ testimony.
[56] Even if the arguments postulated by the learned defence counsel
were to be taken as correct, the learned defence counsel himself
suggested that a breach of the Lock-Up Rules 1953 would only result
in a disciplinary action being taken by the police. Why then would a
disciplinary action be taken against police personnel for taking roti
canai and cigarettes to detainees in the lock-up? Would it not be
because it is an act which is prohibited and in direct contravention of
duties of police personnel in charge of lockup duties? With respect, the
answer is obvious and the same goes with the arguments advanced by
the learned defence counsel.
The presumption
[57] The presumption under section 50(1) of the Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009 may be invoked where it is
established that money has been given or received by the accused. This
position has been clearly illustrated by the then Supreme Court in the
case of PP v. Thavanathan a/l Balasubramaniam (supra) which was
decided based on the equivalent section 14 of the then Prevention of
Corruption Act 1961. On the other hand, section 19(1)(d) of the
Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission Act 2009. This is a
presumption that the gratification was corruptly received or obtained
where it is proved the gratification has been received or obtained by
the accused. The accused is entitled to rebut this presumption by
proving otherwise, namely that the gratification was not received or
obtained corruptly.
[58] If the accused fails to rebut the presumption under section 50(1)
of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, then section
19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 will
30



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

be invoked, namely that the accused will be presumed to have
committed the offence notwithstanding that the act was not in relation
to his principals’ affairs or business.
[59] This to my mind, is the effect of section 19(1)(d) of the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009. Section 19(1)(d) of the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 is an added armoury
of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in its effort to
effectively combat corruption and its menacing effects on society
which has been passed by Parliament. In a charge under section 17(a)
of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, the accused
should in the first instance rebut the presumption of corruptly receiving
of obtaining the gratification under section 50(1) of the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 by adducing evidence to show
that that he did not obtain the gratification corruptly or any explanation
which is “reasonably sufficient to invite belief in its probable
truthfulness”.
[60] The accused in the present appeal did not do so but chose to adopt
a different line of defence, namely that the accused did receive the
RM200.00 as “upah” to bring roti canai and cigarettes to PW1 who was
detained in the lock-up effectively confirming instead of rebutting the
presumption under section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009. This is my considered view has led to the
defence being caught under section 19(1)(d) of the Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009. With respect, I am of the considered
view that the learned Sessions Court Judge did not carve out the correct
interpretation of the law as far as the statutory presumption under
section 19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act
2009 is concerned. Thus, in respect of the presumptions under section
50(1) and section 19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission Act 2009, I am of the considered view that there is no
merit in the defence’s contention.

[61] This court is entitled to presume the constitutionality of Section
19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 as
reiterated by the Federal Court in the case of Pihak Berkuasa Negeri
Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan & Another Appeal [2002] 3 MLJ 72
FC; [2002] 4 CLJ 105; [2002] 3 AMR 2817 whereby the Federal
Court remarked that“It should be borne in mind that there is a strong presumption of
the constitutional validity of an enactment or the impugned
section with the burden of proof on whoever alleges otherwise.
(Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Harun bin Haji Idris & Ors. [1976]
2 MLJ 116 at p. 117; PP v. Su Liang Yu [1976] 2 MLJ 128).”.
[62] If the learned defence counsel is minded to challenge the
constitutionality of Section 19(1)(d) of the Malaysian AntiCorruption
Commission Act 2009, he should make an application to the Sessions
Court to refer the question of constitutional issue to the High Court
under section 30 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964. Once this
question is so referred by the Sessions Court to the High Court, the
High Court will then consider and determine whether there is a question
on constitutional issue necessary for the determination of the Sessions
Court in proceedings pending before it. If there is, the High Court must,
in the form of a special case and transmit to the Federal Court under
section 84 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964, state the question
which will permit an affirmative of negative answer which in the
opinion of the High Court had arisen touching the constitutional issue.
If the High Court considers that there is no such question on
constitutional issue, the case will be sent back to the Sessions Court
for continued hearing. This is the position as illustrated by the Federal
Court in the case of Gan Boon Aun (supra). In the present appeal, there
is no such application being made by the learned defence counsel to the
Sessions Court, neither is there any such reference by being made by
the Sessions Court.

Decision
[63] It is useful to remind myself of the guidelines propounded by the
Federal Court in PP v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar [2006] 1 CLJ 457
whereby it was observed as follows:
“For the guidance of the courts below, we summarise as follows
the steps that should be taken by a trial court at the close of the
prosecution’s case(i)

the close of the prosecution’s case, subject the evidence led
by the prosecution in its totality to a maximum evaluation.
Carefully scrutinise the credibility of each of the
prosecution’s witnesses. Take into account all reasonable
inferences that may be drawn from that evidence. If the
evidence admits of two or more inferences, then draw the
inference that is most favourable to the accused;

(ii)

ask yourself the question: If I now call upon the accused to
make his defence and he elects to remain silent am I
prepared to convict him on the evidence now before me? If
the answer to that question is “Yes”, then a prima facie case
has been made out and the defence should be called. If the
answer is “No” then, a prima facie case has not been made
out and the accused should be acquitted;

(iii) after the defence is called, the accused elects to remain
silent, then convict;
(iv) after defence is called, the accused elects to give evidence,
then go through the steps set out in Mat v. Public Prosecutor
[1963] 1 LNS 82; [1963] MLJ 263.”.
[64] And in Mat v. PP [1963] 1 LNS 82, His Lordship Suffian J. (later
LP) left a plain but yet very useful guide in the following terms:
33



[2017] 1 LNS 2103

Legal Network Series

“The position may be conveniently stated as follows:
(a)

If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the
accused’s guilt ........ Convict.

(b)

If you accept or believe the accused’s explanation.. Acquit.

(c)

If you do not accept or believe the accused’s explanation..
Do not convict but consider the next steps below.

(d)

If you do not accept or believe the accused’s explanation
and that explanation does not raise in your mind a
reasonable doubt as to his guilt........ Convict

(e)

If you do not accept or believe the accused’s explanation
but nevertheless it raises in your mind a reasonable doubt
as to his guilt.. Acquit.”.

[65] Having scrutinised the evidence led by the defence, I am of the
view that the findings made by the learned Sessions Court Judge in
acquitting and dismissing the accused at the end of the prosecution’s
case is against the weight of evidence and the clear words of section
19(1)(d) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009.
Upon a maximum evaluation of the evidence of the prosecution, I am
of the view that there is overwhelming evidence of the commission of
an offence by the accused under section 17(a) of the Malaysian AntiCorruption Commission Act 2009 and that the accused has failed to
raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case.
Pronouncement
[66] Based on the reasons discussed, I allow the appeal by the
prosecution and the acquittal and discharge of the accused is hereby set
aside and substituted with a conviction under section 17(a) of the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009.

Sentence
[67] I have considered the mitigating factors advanced by the learned
counsel and the aggravating factors submitted by the learned
prosecutor. Taking into consideration these factors, the sentence passed
by this court manifests its stance against the prevalence of corruption
and its disruptive effects and the balance this court has to strike based
on the mitigating factors so advanced by the learned counsel. The
accused is hereby sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and
RM10,000.00 fine in default 3 months’ imprisonment.
