An Indonesian woman (‘Eva’) was arrested at the Kuching Airport. During
interrogation, PW5 found that Eva was supposed to check-in at Hotel Fifty
Six (‘hotel’). PW5 went to the hotel to get further information and discovered
that there was one Indonesian man, later identified as the appellant, who had
checked-in in another room. PW5 went to the appellant’s room and
introduced himself. After a search was made, PW5 found a black bag with
a tag of Malaysian Airlines with the appellant’s name on it and some new
clothes in the bag. A hidden compartment was also found in the bag with two
packages wrapped in a purple plastic wrapper. The appellant was brought to
the police station together with the seized items. The two packages wrapped
in the purple plastic wrapper was then handed over to the chemist (‘PW2’)
who then conducted an analysis on the contents of the two packages and
found them to be dangerous drugs, to wit, methamphetamine, weighing
2,290g. The appellant was duly charged at the High Court for the offence of
trafficking in dangerous drugs under s. 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act
1952 (‘DDA’). At the end of the prosecution’s case, the Judicial

Commissioner (‘JC’) found that the prosecution had established a prima face
case against the appellant and he was thus called to enter his defence. The
JC was of the view that the evidence led by the prosecution had established
the factum of possession by way of invoking the presumption of possession
under s. 37(d) of the DDA 1952 and by virtue of the weight of the dangerous
drug that far exceeded the statutory threshold amount, the JC had invoked
the presumption of trafficking under s. 37(da) of the DDA 1952. The
appellant’s version was that he had been invited to Hong Kong by Eva, his
cousin, who had told him he would be paid five million Rupiah for a task
to bring back items relating to a garment business. A Chinese lady had
delivered a bag to Eva, and the appellant had assisted Eva to check the
contents of the bag, which contained some new clothes and shoes. According
to the appellant, nothing incriminating was found in the bag. He was then
asked by Eva to bring the bag to Kuching for a person named John. The
appellant said that he did not know that the bag contained drugs at that time
and that he did not know John, as John was mostly in contact with Eva. The
appellant’s defence was that he was an innocent carrier. The High Court,
however, found that the defence failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the
prosecution’s case and that the appellant failed to rebut both the
presumptions of possession and trafficking on the balance of probabilities.
The appellant was therefore found guilty and was sentenced to death.
Aggrieved, the appellant appealed. It was the appellant’s submission that
there existed material breaks in the chain of evidence in relation to the
alleged exhibits seized from the appellant with regards to (i) the discrepancy
in the gross weight of the alleged exhibits seized; (ii) PW2’s spare key to his
locker that was unaccounted for; (iii) failure of the prosecution to call the
store keeper as a witness; and (iv) the absence or presence of the black
sponges on the alleged drugs exhibits handled by PW5, PW6 and PW2 and
the discrepancy in the description of the red wax seals.
Held (dismissing appeal)
Per Abang Iskandar JCA delivering the judgment of the court:

G

H

I

(1) The complaint of the appellant was that the gross weight of the seized
drugs exhibits given by PW6 was 1310g in respect of exh. P11 and
1820g in respect of exh. P13, whereas the gross weight given by the
chemist PW2 was stated as 1285g in respect of exh. P11 and 1804.71g
in respect of exh. P13. The witnesses who handled the exhibits,
however, testified to the effect that the exhibits that they were
confronted with in court were the very exhibits that they had handled
in the course of the investigation into this case. They had identified them
by way of the markings they had made on the exhibits. As regards to the
gross weight’s difference of the exhibits, the explanation given was that
the police witness and PW2 had used different weighing machines when
they did their respective weighing of the exhibits. From the long line of
decided cases on this ‘different weight’ issue, the existence of a



362

Current Law Journal

[2019] 3 CLJ

discrepancy may not be necessarily fatal to the prosecution case, as long
as such discrepancy could be explained satisfactorily within acceptable
reasons. Thus, the appellant’s complaint regarding this issue was
without merit. (paras 10-14)
(2) The issue of PW2’s spare key to his locker that was unaccounted for
arose because of what PW2 had earlier testified in a separate trial
involving another accused person where he was also the chemist who
had analysed the drugs that formed the subject matter of the charge there.
PW2 had testified in the course of his evidence in that other case that
he had two sets of keys to his locker. On account of this, the appellant
had submitted that other staff of PW2 could have access to the locker
thereby insinuating further that the drug exhibits could be tampered
with. PW2 testified that he could not recall what he had said in the other
case. The JC, who had the advantage of observing the demeanour of this
witness, had found no reason why he ought not to believe the testimony
of PW2 on his explanation and on the fact that PW2 had identified
positively the exhibits in court as the very exhibits which he had
analysed after he had received the same from the police. There was no
cogent reason to deviate from his findings on the issue. (para 15)
(3) Not all and every person who has handled the exhibits in its historical
journey must be called to give evidence in court or else an adverse
inference shall be invoked against the prosecution under s. 114(g) of the
Evidence Act 1950. The mischief that s. 114(g) seeks to address is a
situation where there is suppression of material witness or material
evidence by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding so as to occasion
a prejudice against the accused person leading to a substantial
miscarriage of justice. Herein, the non-calling of the store keeper and
non-production of the exhibit register book did not cause a gap in the
proof of the drug exhibits beyond reasonable doubt. There was thus no
reason an adverse inference ought to be invoked against the prosecution.
(para 16)
(4) As to the issues on the red wax seal and the absence or presence of the
black sponges on the exhibits, these issues were not really of material
significance in the scheme of the overall bigger picture, in light of the
nature of the available evidence led by the prosecution. The identity of
the drug exhibits had been positively identified by the relevant
prosecution witnesses. PW6 had positively identified the two
incriminating exhibits based on the markings which he had almost
contemporaneously made on them. Therefore, the issues raised about
the wax and black sponges were de minimis. (para 17)
(5) The caution statement and the oral evidence of the appellant had
mentioned the name Eva and John. Eva was called as the appellant’s
witness and she denied having anything to do with the impugned drugs
mentioned in the charge that was preferred against the appellant. She had

also denied that she was the trafficker in relation to the said drugs.
Nothing much was also known of John. After applying the two-tier test
alluded to in the case of Mohamad Radhi, it was concluded that John was
a figment of the appellant’s imagination, or a fictitious person. In light
of the evidence led by the appellant and Eva, the JC was correct in
finding that the appellant was the drug trafficker. He was not able to
rebut the presumption of possession as well as the presumption of
trafficking in the said drugs on the balance of probabilities. That ended
the matter in so far as the innocent carrier defence was concerned.
(paras 23-25)
(6) The appellant was not able to furnish useful information or particulars
about the person named John. Indeed according to the appellant, Eva
was dealing with John more than him. No address or handphone number
of John were given to the police in the course of the investigation,
including the caution statement of the appellant. It was unfair to expect
the police to trace this person named John whom the appellant had
claimed to have handed him the bag in Hong Kong. It could hardly be
said that a proper Alcontara notice had been given by the appellant to the
investigating authority. Further, the submission by the appellant that he
was just a simpleton who did the thing he did because he was convinced
by Eva, was found to be a far-fetched proposition in light of the not so
simple journey that the appellant would have to undergo just to bring
four pairs of jeans and t-shirts meant for business in Kuching. The
appellant had to come all the way from Indonesia to Hong Kong for what
could be patently described as a simple transaction that ought not to
require such service involving the appellant having to come all the way
from Indonesia. On top of that, he would be paid five million
Indonesian Rupiah for his effort with the plane ticket all paid for. The
JC was not able to accept the contention that the appellant was a mere
simpleton and suffice it to say that this court agreed with the said
conclusion. (paras 26 & 27)
(7) The appellant was a trafficker and not an innocent carrier. The evidence
before the JC was such that he was justified in concluding as he did that
a case beyond reasonable doubt had been established by the prosecution
against the appellant on the preferred charge of trafficking in dangerous
drugs to wit 2,290g of methamphetamine. Thus, this court affirmed both
the conviction entered against the appellant and the death sentence by
hanging imposed on the appellant. (paras 31 & 33)

Seorang wanita warganegara Indonesia (‘Eva’) telah ditahan di Lapangan

mendaftar masuk di Hotel Fifty Six (‘hotel’). PW5 telah ke hotel itu untuk
mendapatkan maklumat lanjut dan mendapati bahawa seorang lelaki
warganegara Indonesia telah mendaftar masuk di sebuah bilik lain. PW5 ke

bilik perayu dan memperkenalkan dirinya. Selepas carian dibuat, PW5
menjumpai sebuah beg hitam dengan tag Malaysia Airlines yang tertera nama
perayu atasnya dan beberapa baju baharu dalam beg tersebut. Satu ruang
rahsia juga ditemui dalam bag di mana terdapat dua bungkusan yang dibalut
pembalut plastik berwarna ungu. Perayu dibawa ke balai polis bersama-sama
dengan item-item yang telah dirampas. Kedua-dua bungkusan yang dibalut
pembalut plastik ungu kemudian diserahkan kepada ahli kimia (‘PW2’) yang
menjalankan analisis atas kandungan kedua-dua bungkusan dan mendapati
terdapat dadah-dadah berbahaya, iaitu methamphetamine, seberat 2,290g.
Perayu dituduh di Mahkamah Tinggi atas kesalahan mengedar dadah
berbahaya bawah s. 39B(1)(a) Akta Dadah Berbahaya 1952 (‘ADB 1952’). Di
akhir kes pendakwaan, Pesuruhjaya Kehakiman (‘PK’) mendapati pihak
pendakwaan membuktikan satu kes prima facie terhadap perayu dan dia
dipanggil membela diri. Pesuruhjaya Kehakiman berpendapat bahawa
keterangan yang dikemukakan oleh pihak pendakwaan membuktikan fakta
milikan dengan menggunakan anggapan milikan bawah s. 37(d) ADB 1952
dan berdasarkan berat dadah berbahaya yang jauh melebihi amaun ambang
batas, PK telah menggunakan anggapan pengedaran bawah s. 37(da) ADB
1952. Versi perayu adalah bahawa dia telah dijemput ke Hong Kong oleh
Eva, saudara perempuannya, yang memberitahunya bahawa dia akan dibayar
lima juta Rupiah untuk tugas membawa item berhubungan perniagaan
pakaian. Seorang wanita berbangsa Cina telah menyerahkan sebuah beg
kepada Eva, dan perayu membantu Eva memeriksa kandungannya, yang
mengandungi beberapa pakaian dan kasut baharu. Menurut perayu, tiada
apa-apa barang yang menimbulkan syak dijumpai dalam beg itu. Perayu
kemudian diminta oleh Eva untuk membawa beg itu ke Kuching untuk diberi
kepada seorang bernama John. Perayu menyatakan bahawa dia tidak
mengetahui beg tersebut mengandungi dadah pada waktu itu dan dia juga
tidak mengenali John kerana John hanya berhubung dengan Eva. Pembelaan
perayu adalah bahawa dia seorang pembawa tidak bersalah. Mahkamah
Tinggi, walau bagaimanapun, mendapati pembelaan gagal menimbulkan
keraguan munasabah atas kes pendakwaan dan bahawa perayu gagal
menyangkal kedua-dua anggapan milikan dan pengedaran atas imbangan
kebarangkalian. Oleh itu, perayu didapati bersalah dan dijatuhi hukuman
gantung. Terkilan, perayu merayu. Perayu menghujahkan terdapat
pemutusan dalam rantaian keterangan berhubung ekshibit-ekshibit yang
dirampas daripada perayu berhubung (i) percanggahan dalam berat kasar
ekshibit-ekshibit yang dirampas; (ii) kunci pendua PW2 tidak dapat dikesan;
(iii) kegagalan pihak pendakwaan memanggil penjaga setor sebagai saksi; dan
(iv) ketiadaan atau kehadiran span hitam pada dadah-dadah yang
diekshibitkan yang dikendali oleh PW5, PW6 dan PW2 dan percanggahan
dalam penjelasan berkenaan cap meterai merah.

Diputuskan (menolak rayuan)
Oleh Abang Iskandar HMR menyampaikan penghakiman mahkamah:
(1) Aduan perayu adalah bahawa berat bersih ekshibit-ekshibit dadah yang
diberi PW6 adalah 1310g untuk eks. P11 dan 1820g untuk eks. P13,
sementara berat bersih yang diberi oleh PW2 dinyatakan sebagai 1285
gram berkenaan eks. P11 dan 1804.71g untuk eks. P13. Saksi-saksi yang
mengendalikan ekshibit-ekshibit, walau bagaimanapun, memberi
keterangan bahawa ekshibit-ekshibit di mahkamah adalah ekshibitekshibit yang sama yang dikendalikan oleh mereka dalam penjalanan
penyiasatan kes ini. Mereka telah mengenal pastinya melalui tandatanda yang dibuat oleh mereka atas ekshibit-ekshibit itu. Berkenaan
perbezaan berat bersih ekshibit-ekshibit, penjelasan yang diberi adalah
bahawa saksi polis dan PW2 telah menggunakan mesin berat yang
berbeza apabila mereka masing-masing mengambil berat ekshibitekshibit itu. Dari kes-kes yang menangani isu ‘berat berbeza’ ini,
kewujudan percanggahan tidak semestinya menjejaskan kes pendakwaan,
selagi percanggahan tersebut boleh diterangkan secara memuaskan
dengan sebab yang boleh diterima. Oleh itu, aduan perayu berkenaan isu
ini tidak bermerit.
(2) Isu PW2 berkenaan kunci pendua kepada tempat simpanannya yang
tidak dapat dikesan timbul kerana PW2 sebelum ini memberi
keterangan dalam perbicaraan lain melibatkan tertuduh lain di mana
PW2 juga ahli kimia yang menganalisis dadah-dadah yang membentuk
hal perkara pertuduhan itu. PW2 telah memberi keterangan dalam
perjalanan keterangannya dalam kes yang lain itu bahawa dia
mempunyai dua kunci untuk tempat simpanannya. Oleh itu, perayu
menghujahkan bahawa pekerja-pekerja PW2 mempunyai akses terhadap
tempat simpanan itu dengan itu membayangkan lanjut bahawa ekshibitekshibit dadah itu boleh diganggu. PW2 memberi keterangan bahawa
dia tidak boleh ingat semula apa-apa yang telah dinyatakannya dalam
kes yang lain itu. Pesuruhjaya Kehakiman, yang mempunyai kesempatan
memerhati tingkah laku saksi itu, tidak mendapati apa-apa sebab untuk
tidak percaya keterangan PW2 berkenaan penjelasannya dan atas fakta
bahawa PW2 telah mengenal pasti dengan positif ekshibit-ekshibit di
mahkamah sebagai ekshibit-ekshibit yang dianalisis olehnya selepas dia
menerimanya daripada pihak polis. Tiada alasan yang kukuh untuk
menyimpang daripada penemuan-penemuannya berkenaan isu ini.
(3) Tidak semua dan setiap orang yang telah mengendalikan ekshibitekshibit dalam sejarah perjalanannya harus dipanggil memberi
keterangan di mahkamah jika tidak anggapan bertentangan akan
dibangkitkan terhadap pihak pendakwaan bawah s. 114(g) Akta
Keterangan 1950. Salah laku yang ingin ditangani oleh s. 114(g) adalah
situasi di mana terdapat sekatan saksi atau keterangan material oleh
pihak pendakwaan dalam prosiding jenayah sehingga menyebabkan



366

Current Law Journal

[2019] 3 CLJ

prejudis terhadap tertuduh yang membawa pada satu ketidakadilan
serius. Di sini, kegagalan memanggil penjaga setor dan kegagalan
mengemukakan buku daftar tidak menyebabkan kelompangan dalam
bukti ekshibit-ekshibit dadah-dadah melampaui keraguan munasabah.
Oleh itu, tiada alasan untuk anggapan bertentangan dikenakan terhadap
pihak pendakwaan.
(4) Berkenaan isu-isu cap meterai merah dan ketiadaan serta kehadiran
span-span hitam atas ekshibit-ekshibit, isu-isu ini tidak penting dalam
gambaran keseluruhan yang lebih besar, mengambil kira sifat keterangan
sedia ada yang dikemukakan oleh pihak pendakwaan. Identiti ekshibitekshibit dadah telah dikenal pasti secara positif oleh saksi-saksi
pendakwaan yang relevan. PW6 telah secara positif mengenal pasti dua
ekshibit yang menunjukkan kesalahan berdasarkan tanda-tanda yang
telah dia buat padanya. Oleh itu, isu-isu yang timbul berkenaan cap
meterai merah dan span-span hitam itu adalah de minimis.
(5) Kenyataan beramaran dan keterangan lisan perayu menyatakan nama
Eva dan John. Eva dipanggil sebagai saksi perayu dan dia menafikan dia
ada kena mengena dengan dadah-dadah berbahaya yang disebut dalam
pertuduhan terhadap perayu. Eva juga menafikan dia adalah pengedar
dadah-dadah tersebut. Tiada apa-apa yang diketahui berkenaan John.
Selepas mengguna pakai ujian dua peringkat yang dimaksudkan dalam
kes Mohamad Radhi, disimpulkan bahawa John hanyalah imaginasi
perayu atau seseorang yang direka. Berdasarkan keterangan yang
dikemukakan oleh perayu dan Eva, PK betul dalam mendapati perayu
seorang pengedar dadah. Perayu tidak dapat menyangkal anggapan
milikan dan juga anggapan pengedaran dadah-dadah tersebut atas
imbangan kebarangkalian. Ini membantutkan pembelaan pembawa tidak
bersalah.
(6) Perayu tidak dapat memberi maklumat atau butir-butir yang berguna
tentang John. Menurut perayu, Eva yang banyak berhubung dengan
John. Alamat dan nombor telefon John tidak diberi kepada polis semasa
penyiasatan, termasuk kenyataan beramaran perayu. Tidak adil untuk
mengharapkan pihak polis mencari orang yang bernama John yang
perayu dakwa telah memberikan beg itu kepadanya di Hong Kong.
Tiada notis Alcontara yang betul telah diberi oleh perayu kepada pihak
berkuasa yang menyiasat. Tambahan lagi, hujahan perayu bahawa dia
adalah orang yang mudah tertipu yang berbuat demikian kerana dipaksa
oleh Eva, adalah satu cadangan yang tidak masuk akal memandangkan
perayu telah mengambil perjalanan yang agak sukar hanya untuk
membawa empat helai seluar dan kemeja-kemeja yang bertujuan untuk
perniagaan di Kuching. Perayu telah datang melancong ke Hong Kong
dari Indonesia untuk sesuatu yang boleh dikatakan transaksi yang agak
mudah yang tidak memerlukan perkhidmatan melibatkan perayu datang
dari Indonesia. Tambahan pula, perayu akan dibayar lima juta Rupiah
Indonesia untuk usahanya dengan tiket penerbangan dibayar

sepenuhnya. Pesuruhjaya Kehakiman tidak dapat menerima hujahan
bahawa perayu seorang yang mudah tertipu dan memadai untuk
menyatakan bahawa mahkamah ini bersetuju dengan kesimpulan
tersebut.
(7) Perayu seorang pengedar dan bukan pembawa tidak bersalah.
Keterangan di hadapan PK adalah bahawa dia mempunyai justifikasi
dalam menyimpulkan bahawa satu kes melampaui keraguan munasabah
telah dibuktikan oleh pihak pendakwaan terhadap perayu atas
pertuduhan pengedaran dadah berbahaya 2,290g methamphetamine.
Oleh itu, mahkamah ini mengesahkan kedua-dua sabitan yang
dimasukkan terhadap perayu dan hukuman gantung sampai mati yang
dijatuhkan atas perayu.

Brief Facts Of The Case
[1]
On 6 November 2014, Inspector Mohd Kairil Mohd Johar (PW5) was
informed by his superior officer of an arrest on an Indonesian woman named
Eva Slyviana (Eva) at Kuching Airport. PW5 interrogated Eva and found
that Eva was supposed to check-in at Hotel Fifty Six (hotel). PW5 went to
the hotel to get further information.
[2]
PW5 approached an employee of the hotel and the employee said Eva
had not checked-in, however, there is one Indonesian man who had checkedin in another room. The man was later identified as Wahyudin
(“the appellant”). The employee said, the appellant also asked about Eva as
well. PW5 decided to check the room occupied by the appellant.
[3]
PW5 went to appellant’s room and introduced himself as a police
officer. After a search was made, PW5 found a black bag with the label “OR
and MI” with a tag of Malaysian Airline with appellant’s name on it and
some new clothes in the bag. PW5 also found a hidden compartment in the
bag with two packages wrapped in purple plastic wrapper. A small sling bag
was found on the bed that contained identification papers, e-ticker and hand
phones.
[4]
The appellant was brought to the police station together with the items
seized and PW5 handed them over to the investigation officer (IO), Inspector
Abang Zulkernaen bin Abang Kerni (PW6). PW6 gave the two packages
wrapped in purple plastic wrapper to the chemist, En Mohd Riduan bin Md
Bakhir (PW2). PW2 then conducted an analysis on the contents of the two
packages and found them to be dangerous drugs, to wit, methamphetamine,
weighing 2,290g.

[5]
The appellant was duly charged in the High Court for drug trafficking
in respect of the methamphetamine that was found from inside his bag. The
prosecution had called the witnesses whom it believed were relevant in
establishing the case against the appellant as per the charge.
[6]
At the end of prosecution case, the learned Judicial Commissioner
(“JC”) found that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against
the appellant and he was thus called to enter his defence. When calling for
the defence, the learned JC was of the view that the evidence led by the
prosecution had established the factum of possession by way of invoking the
presumption of possession under s. 37(d) of the DDA 1952. By virtue of the
weight of the dangerous drug that far exceeded the statutory threshold
amount, the learned JC had invoked the presumption of trafficking under
s. 37(da) of the DDA 1952.
Case For Defence
[7]
The appellant’s version was that, he was invited to go to Hong Kong
by Eva, his cousin. He agreed to follow Eva to Hong Kong when she said
he would be paid five million Rupiah for a task to bring back items relating

to garment business. He said the bag was delivered to the hotel room in Hong
Kong to Eva by a Chinese lady. After the Chinese lady gave the bag to Eva,
the appellant assisted Eva to check the contents of the bag in front of the
Chinese lady. They took out the contents of the bag, which contained some
new clothes and shoes. After checking that the bag did not contain any
incriminating material, they placed the clothes and shoes back into the bag.
He said he was then asked by Eva to bring the bag to Kuching for a person
by the name of John and that someone would collect the bag when he arrived
in Kuching. The appellant said that he did not know that the bag contained
drugs at that time. He also did not suspect that the bag had a secret
compartment. The appellant contended that he did not know much about
John, as John was mostly in contact with Eva. The appellant called Eva as
his witness and she was DW2 in this case. In essence, the appellant’s defence
was that he was an innocent carrier.

At the end of the whole trial, the learned JC of the High Court found
that the defence failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case.
He had also found that the appellant had failed to rebut both the
presumptions of possession and trafficking on the balance of probabilities.
The appellant was therefore found guilty and was sentenced to death by
hanging. Aggrieved with such decision, the appellant had since filed a notice
of appeal against it to the Court of Appeal.

Before us, the appellant’s learned defence counsel, Mr Ranbir Singh
Sangha (Mr Ranbir) emphasised on the issue that had pertained to the alleged
break in the chain of evidence in relation to the drug exhibits, the subject
matter of the charge. He submitted that there existed material breaks in the
chain of evidence in relation to the alleged exhibits seized from the appellant
with regards to the following:
(i) the discrepancy in the gross weight of the alleged exhibits seized;
(ii) the absence or presence of the black sponges on the alleged drug exhibits
handled by the raiding officer (PW5), investigating officer (PW6) and
the chemist (PW2);

H

(iii) the discrepancy in the description of the red wax seals;
(iv) the chemist’s spare key to his locker that is unaccounted for;
(v) the failure to tender the exhibit store register nor call the exhibit store
keeper.

I

[10] We had perused the grounds of judgment of the learned JC and we
noted that he had dealt with these issues individually. As regards the
discrepancy in the gross weight of the alleged exhibits seized, essentially the
complaint of the appellant on this issue was that the gross weight of the seized



370

[2019] 3 CLJ

drugs exhibits given by the raiding officer (PW6) was 1,310g in respect of
exh. P11 and 1820 grams in respect of exh. P13, whereas the gross weight
given by the chemist (PW2) was stated at 1,285g in respect of exh. P11 and
1,804.71g in respect of exh. P13. In light of these apparent discrepancies as
to the gross weight of the two exhibits, learned counsel for the appellant
submitted that the identity of the drugs exhibits produced in court must be
suspect, and the possibility of tampering was also suggested, thereby casting
a serious and reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. The learned Deputy
Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) before us submitted that the witnesses called by
the prosecution who handled the exhibits were called to testify and they
testified to the effect that the exhibits that they were confronted with in court
were the very exhibits that they had handled in the course of the investigation
into this case. They had identified them by way of the markings they had
made on the exhibits. As regards to the gross weight’s differences of the
exhibits, the explanation given was that the police witness and the chemist
had used different weighing machines when they did their respective
weighing of the exhibits. The factual scenario surrounding this issue
pertaining to the difference in gross weights as recorded by the chemist
(PW2) and the raiding officer (PW6) was captured in the grounds of judgment
of the learned JC in para. [61] therein, as follows:
Learned counsel further submitted that if this court were to compare
again the weight of the packages AZ1 and AZ2 as testified by the
witnesses after having taken into account the weight of the shiny plastic
packages, the court would discover that there was a gross difference of
24.984g in AZ1 and 15.286g in AZ2. In short the difference between
PW6’s and PW2’s gross weight findings are as follows:
(i) P11(A) plus P11(A)(1) plus P11(B): 1310g [PW6] – 1285.016g [PW2]
= 24.984g

(ii) P13(A) plus P13(A)(1) plus P13(B): 1820g [PW6] – 1804.714g [PW2]
= 15.286g.

[11] The learned JC having considered the evidence and having seen the
witnesses, had accepted the explanation given in respect of the difference in
the gross weight as one that was reasonable and acceptable.
[12] We noted that in coming to that conclusion, the learned JC had
addressed his mind to quite an extensive line of high authorities on the issue
of weight discrepancies between police witnesses and chemist in drug
trafficking cases. From the long line of decided cases on this ‘different
weight’ issue, the existence of a discrepancy may not be necessarily fatal to
the prosecution case, as long as such discrepancy can be explained away
satisfactorily within acceptable reason. This proposition can find support in
the Federal Court decision in the case of Hasbala Mohd Sarong v. PP [2013]
6 CLJ 945, which had affirmed the decision of Loh Kah Loon v. PP [2011]
5 CLJ 345 where it was commented as follows:

[2019] 3 CLJ

Wahyudin v. PP

371

A

[22] In this regard, we are minded of the fact that decided cases had
shown that the difference in weight of the drug exhibits between the
police and the chemist when left unexplained could result in creating a
reasonable doubt to the prosecution’s case. This is however dependent on
the facts of each case ...

[13] The apex court Justices went on to explain what had happened in the
Loh Kah Loon v. PP (supra) as follows:

C

D

F

G

H

I

[24] However, in Loh Kah Loon v. PP [2011] 5 CLJ 345, this court upheld
the decision of the courts below even though there existed a discrepancy
in the weight of the drug exhibits as found by the police and the chemist.
In that case the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal found it as
a fact that there was no doubt in the identity of the drug exhibits because
the evidence before the court showed there was no break in the chain of
evidence. The movement of exhibits was clearly explained, and the
markings on the drug exhibits were positively identified by the witnesses.
The courts below were satisfied that the drug exhibits that were seized
from the appellant were the same exhibits produced in the High Court.

[14] As it had come to pass, the learned JC accepted the explanation given
by the prosecution witnesses and also the fact that the relevant witnesses for
the prosecution had positively identified the exhibits as the same exhibits that
they had handled in the course of their investigation pertaining to this case.
With respect, we could find no reason to fault the learned JC with regard to
his conclusion on the weight discrepancy issue. We found the complaint
raised on behalf of the appellant to be without merit.
[15] The next issue on the break in the chain of evidence had been the
allegation that chemist’s spare key to his locker that was unaccounted for.
This issue arose because of what the chemist PW2 had earlier testified in a
separate trial involving another accused person where he was also the
chemist who had analysed the drugs that formed the subject matter of the
charge there. In the course of his evidence in that other case, the chemist
testified that he had two sets of keys to his locker. On account of this, learned
counsel for the appellant had submitted that other staff of PW2 could have
access to the locker, thereby insinuating further that the exhibit drugs could
be tampered with. PW2 testified that he could not recall what he had said
in the other case. The learned JC who had the advantage of observing the
demeanour of this witness had found no reason why he ought not believe the
testimony of PW2 on his explanation and on the fact that PW2 had identified
positively the exhibits in court as the very exhibit which he had analysed
after he had received the same from the police, by way of the markings that
he had made on the exhibits. We found no cogent reason to deviate from his
findings on the issue. At para. [80] of his grounds of judgment the learned
JC had stated:
In the present case, to counter the arguments on this point and also on
the point relating to the testimony of PW2 that there was only one set
of key to PW2’s locker, the learned DPP had argued in this case the



372

Current Law Journal

[2019] 3 CLJ

relevant witnesses [PW2, PW5 and PW6] had established in their
evidence that they have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that the
exhibits were in their custody at all times, and they have identified the
said exhibits when the exhibits were produced in court through the
marking that they had make. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that
the identity of the said exhibits was in dispute or that it had been
tampered with. I see no reasons not to agree with the submission of the
learned DPP on this point.

[16] Another issue raised had been the failure of the prosecution to call the
storekeeper as a witness and the non-production of the exhibit register book.
In this regard, learned counsel had urged the learned JC to invoke the adverse
inference against the prosecution. We noted that the learned JC had cited the
Federal Court case of Su Ah Ping v. PP [1979] 1 LNS 100 which has long been
held as the high authority for the proposition that not all and every person
who has handled the exhibit in its historical journey, must be called to give
evidence in court or else an adverse inference shall be invoked against the
prosecution under s. 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950. The mischief that
s. 114(g) seeks to address is a situation where there is suppression of material
witness or material evidence by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding so
as to occasion a prejudice against the accused person leading to a substantial
miscarriage of justice. In such a case, the adverse inference may justifiably
be invoked against the suppressing party. (See, generally the Supreme Court
case of Munusamy Vengadasalam v. PP [1987] 1 CLJ 250; [1987] CLJ (Rep)
221; [1987] 1 MLJ 492 per Mohammed Azmi SCJ). In a prosecution, the
discretion to call a witness lies with the prosecutor and no one can force the
prosecutor whether to call a particular witness but that having been said, an
exercise of such discretion by the prosecutor is governed, always, by the
consideration that non-calling of a witness may leave a gap in the
prosecution’s case. (See the case of Abdullah Zawawi Omar v. PP [1985] 2 CLJ
2; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 19 per Salleh Abas, LP). As such, did the non-calling
of the storekeeper and the non-production of the exhibit register book cause
a gap in the proof of the drug exhibits beyond reasonable doubt? The learned
JC had answered that in the negative. Having perused through the appeal
record, we were in agreement with him in that there was no reason why an
adverse inference ought to be invoked against the prosecution.
[17] As to the issues on the red wax seal and the absence or presence of the
black sponges on the exhibits, the learned JC was of the view that these issues
were not really of material significance in the scheme of the overall bigger
picture, in light of the nature of the available evidence led by the prosecution.
Again, we would defer to his conclusion as the identity of the drug exhibits
had been positively identified by the relevant prosecution witnesses. Here,
again we could not overemphasise the significance of what learned Justice
Suffian LP had said nearly 40 years ago in the locus classicus case of Su Ah
Ping (supra), where His Lordship had occasion to say: “In our judgment, if

the officer who picked up an object at the scene produced it and identified
it as that very object, that is enough …” In this case, the witness PW6 had
positively identified the two incriminating exhibits based on the markings
which he had almost contemporaneously made on them. It was therefore
correct for the learned JC to regard the issues raised about the wax and black
sponges as, without being derogatory, de minimis.

C

[18] Besides the complaints that the appellant had with regard to the alleged
breaks in the chain of evidence, the appellant had also submitted that the
learned JC was in error when he failed to rule that the appellant was in fact
an innocent carrier, not a drug trafficker. In fact, the essence of the appellant
defence had been that he was merely an innocent carrier.

D

E

F

G

H

I

[19] The learned JC was aware of this defence and he had devoted a good
portion of time appreciating the appellant’s defence as such, and at the end
of that judicial exercise, he had concluded that the appellant had failed to
rebut the presumptions of possession and trafficking that were operating
against the appellant on the balance of probabilities.
[20] In the course of evaluating the appellant’s defence of innocent carrier,
the learned JC had discussed the law on the defence of innocent carrier in
a drug trafficking case under the DDA 1952. In fact, such a defence is
nothing new and it has a close proximity in terms of application with the
notion of wilful blindness. We now would allude to the learned JC’s
treatment of this defence in the course of his grounds of decision, like so:
[107] In order to raise a defence of innocent carrier, an accused must show
that he did not have the knowledge and had taken steps to make inquiries
on the contents of the bag. The defence in the present case had submitted
at length that the accused not only did not know about the drugs in the
bag but he also taken reasonable steps to ensure that the items that he
was carrying was not an incriminating substance. The accused testified
that he had taken those measures when he and DW2 checked the bag
in the hotel room after it was delivered to DW2 on the 3rd November
2014. That is a clear two days before the accused departed from Hong
Kong to Kuching where he was arrested.
[108] The prosecution, in urging the court to be wary of the said evidence,
submitted that the evidence of the accused and DW2 had checked the
bag ought not to be accepted as the truth considering the facts of this
case. It was pointed out the quantity of the drugs in this case is quite
substantial i.e. more than 2 kilogram. If indeed the accused had emptied
the bag and checked the contents of the bag, the accused would have
realised the bag would still be heavy even when the contents has been
emptied. In fact, this was what PW5 discovered when he checked the bag.
It was the weight of the bag when it is empty that caused PW5 to suspect
that something was amiss about the bag. On careful observation, he
found there was a slight bump on the bag and after further observation
he found traces of glue on the outer lining of the secret compartment.



374

Current Law Journal

[2019] 3 CLJ

[109] Now, having considered PW5’s evidence, I am of the view that if
the accused had checked the bag thoroughly, I do not see why he cannot
detect that something was amiss especially considering the weight of the
bag when it was empty. The defence had argued that there were no
reasons for the accused to suspect something was amiss as he was not
suspicious or was not out to look for something amiss with the bag unlike
PW5. With respect, I do not accept the said argument. Firstly, what was
the purpose of the accused and DW2 checked the bag upon receiving it
from the Chinese lady. Based on the evidence of DW2, the reason why
she had checked the bag was she feared that she would be cheated by
John. In other words she was worried that John would have played her
out by stuffing the bag with incriminating matter. It was for that reason
that she said she checked the bag and its contents. Upon seeing DW2
checked the bag, the accused as a reasonable person would have also
entertained doubt as to what was inside the bag. Yet despite that the
accused did not offer any explanation why he was not thorough in
checking. If he had, he too would have noticed that the bag was still
heavy upon the contents had been emptied.
[110] Based on the evidence, I take the view that his evidence and the
evidence of DW2 on the matter is highly suspicious and I do not believe
that he did not know what was inside the bag. I believe that the evidence
of that he had checked the bag with DW2 was merely a ploy to
disassociate themselves with the contents in the hidden compartment of
the bag in the event that they were arrested. I take this view by looking
at the circumstances of this case as whole. Looking at the evidence, it was
clear that the accused knew what he was required to do by accepting the
offer to go to Hong Kong with DW2. From his own evidence he knew
that he was required to carry bags or to bring back items for DW2. He
also knew that DW2 would pay for his expenses and had indeed paid for
all his expenses for his whole trip from Jakarta to Kuching. On top of that
he will also be paid 5 million rupiah for his task.
[111] Now, since he was tasked to carry the items for his trip back from
Hong Kong to Jakarta, the first thing that would raise his suspicion on
his task was when he was given the bag to carry back with him. The
learned DPP has submitted on this point and I completely agree with him.
I reproduced what he said:
It would definitely raise suspicion in this case, the reason that Eva
gave for her trip to Hong Kong which was to collect bag containing
clothes for trading was not plausible. If the Accused claimed was
right, that he checked the content of the said bag, he would realize
that there was only 4 pairs of jeans and 2 t-shirts in it. According
to him, he was informed by DW2 that these clothes were for
trading as explained by John. And if it is true that he was asked
to follow Eva in order to bring this bag and once it being handed
to someone else, he will be paid 5 million rupees. Does it not raise
any suspicion on the Accused? The clothes inside the bag was very
minimal in number, in which it is more economical for them to be
couriered or to be posted? Or at least, don’t it raised suspicion if
someone willing to pay 5 million rupees for only that 6 clothes? If

the Accused indeed checked, don’t it raise suspicion why would
there be 2 same items being bought as a sample. Kindly refer to
Exhibit P25 and P26, the said jeans are identical! Nothing in
evidence that could suggest that the Accused had made an inquiry
over these.

B

[112] The defence in rebutting the arguments advanced by the
prosecution had placed heavy reliance on the arguments that the accused
did not make further inquiries on the matter as he trusted DW2, he was
a simpleton and was merely relying heavily on the instructions given by
DW2. Again the learned DPP pointed out if he was a simpleton and had
relied on DW2 for instructions, how did the accused managed to find his
way from Hong Kong to Kuching and arrived at the hotel that had been
booked by DW2 all on his own effort? He certainly is not as what was
portrayed by the defence. Again, I agree with his submission on this point.

C

D

E

F

375

[113] In conclusion, after hearing the evidence of the accused and DW2,
I do not accept the defence of the accused that he was an innocent carrier
as claimed. I also do not believe his evidence that he had checked the bag
and from the surrounding circumstances of the case, I find that he knew
what he was up to and he knew what was inside the secret compartment
of the bag. In the circumstances he did not manage to raise a doubt in
the prosecution case neither did he managed to rebut the statutory
presumption of possession that had been invoked against him. Whether
the accused had rebutted the statutory presumption of trafficking under
section 37(da) of the DDA.

[21] We noted too that the learned JC had directed his mind to the relevant
decided cases which are authorities on matters related to the defence of
innocent carrier in a drug trafficking prosecution. The first case on point
referred to by the learned JC was the Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP [1991]
3 CLJ 2073; [1991] 1 CLJ (Rep) 311 (“the Mohamad Radhi case”).
[22] We reproduce below the learned JC’s treatment of the appellant’s
defence on he being a mere innocent carrier, as follows:

G

H

I

[114] In the course of the submission, the defence had also advanced the
arguments that the actual trafficker in this case is John and/or Eva and
the accused merely had the bag with him when he was arrested. In other
words, he was merely a mere possessor of the bag without knowledge of
the impugned drugs. In view of the arguments, it is necessary for this
court to consider the principles as laid down in the case of Mohamad Radhi
v. Public Prosecutor [1991] 3 CLJ 2073; which is commonly referred to as the
Radhi direction.
[115] In the case of Yee Wen Chin v. PP [2008] 6 CLJ 773, the Radhi
direction was explained in the judgment of Gopal Sri Ram JCA as follows
(at p 784): “In the course of cross-examining the prosecution witnesses it
was extracted from PW5 that the information he had received was that
Woo Kok Mend was trafficking in drugs at the place in question. The
defence quite properly took advantage of this fact to demonstrate that
Woo was the real trafficker and that the accused was entirely innocent.
The accused was clearly entitled to do this in view of the decision in



376

Current Law Journal

[2019] 3 CLJ

Mohamad Radhi v. Public Prosecutor [1991] 3 CLJ 2073; [1991]
1 CLJ (Rep) 311 SC. That case is authority for the proposition that a
person charged with trafficking is entitled to an acquittal on that charge
by showing that he was a mere possessor of the drugs whilst another was
the true trafficker. Whenever such a defence is taken two separate
exercises must be carried out by the trial judge. He must first determine
as a fact whether that other is a real person or a mere figment of the
accused’s imagination invented for the purpose of the trial. Next, if he
finds that other person to be real the judge must then determine whether
that other person is the real trafficker. This is called the Radhi direction
and must be administered by a court unto itself when such a defence is
taken. See Sochima Okoye v. Public Prosecutor [1995] 3 CLJ 371 CA.

[23] Now, having gone through the records of this appeal, we were satisfied
with the conclusion arrived at by the learned JC in light of the evidence led
by the appellant and by DW2, applied by him in the context of the applicable
law on the defence of innocent carrier. He was correct in arriving as he did
at the finding that the appellant was the drug trafficker in this case. He was
not able to rebut the presumption of possession as well as the presumption
of trafficking in the said drugs on the balance of probabilities after having
considered all the available evidence placed before him, including the
caution statement of the appellant as well as the oral evidence of Eva, the
DW2.
[24] The fact that the caution statement of the appellant was aligned with
what he testified under oath in court did not necessarily mean that what he
had alluded to in both instances must be the truth or must be given credence
such that the presumptions were thereby rebutted on the balance of
probabilities, or that a reasonable doubt must have been created by such
evidence as to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case. The
appellant’s evidence, including his caution statement must be evaluated in
light of the entirety of the evidence adduced before the court.
[25] The caution statement and the oral evidence of the appellant in this
case had mentioned the name Eva and John. It was suggested by the appellant
that real trafficker was either, his own cousin namely DW2, or the character
mentioned as John in his evidence and in his caution statement. DW2 was
called as the appellant’s witness and she denied having anything to do with
the impugned drugs mentioned in the charge that was preferred against the
appellant in this case. More significantly, she had also denied that she was
the trafficker in relation to the said drugs. That had left John as the suspected
trafficker. But nothing much was known of John who had purportedly given
the appellant the bag that had contained the drugs in Hong Kong for the
purpose of the appellant handing it over to someone who would be picking
the said bag in Kuching from the appellant. The learned JC had considered
this matter in his appreciation of the appellant’s defence of innocent carrier.

the learned JC had concluded that John was a figment of the appellant’s
imagination, or otherwise known as a fictitious person. That ended the
matter in so far as the innocent carrier defence was concerned. With respect,
we were in agreement with the learned JC in that regard.
[26] In regards to the Alcontara notice issue, we would need to say a little
more in the context of the evidence in this appeal before us. It is this. We
noted that the appellant was not able to furnish useful information or
particulars about the person in Hong Kong called John who had purportedly
handed him the bag that contained the dangerous drugs. Indeed according to
the appellant, Eva was dealing with John more than him. No address nor
handphone number of John were given to the police in the course of
investigation, including the caution statement of the appellant. In such a
situation, it would be unfair to expect the police to trace this person named
John whom the appellant had claimed to have handed him the bag in Hong
Kong. It can hardly be said that a proper Alcontara notice had been given by
the appellant to the investigating authority. In the Alcontara Ambross Anthony
v. PP [1996] 1 CLJ 705 case itself, the accused person had given the personal
particulars of Che Mat, whom the accused had claimed was the owner of the
keropok when he was stopped by the police. He had told the police that the
cargo in the gunny sacks in his car boot was keropok as told to him by Che
Mat. He proceeded to give the particulars of Che Mat, including his
telephone number. The keropok later, on further examination, turned out to
be dangerous drug, cannabis. The investigating officer, despite admittedly in
possession of this particular information about Che Mat, also admittedly did
not carry out any investigation to check out the veracity of Alcontara’s
assertion, backed by specific particulars regarding Che Mat, who could either
be a real person or a mere creation of Alcontara’s imagination. As was
alluded to earlier, Alcontara was convicted on the charge of drug trafficking
in the cannabis and was sentenced by the High Court to death by hanging by
the learned trial judge who was of the considered view that Alcontara’s
defence was but an afterthought. His conviction and sentence were affirmed
by the Court of Appeal. On appeal to the Federal Court, his conviction and
sentence were set aside. It was found by the apex court Justices that
Alcontara should not be penalised by the lack of ingenuity on the part of the
investigating officer. In essence, Alcontara had been highly prejudiced by the
failure by the investigating officer to investigate into the veracity of
Alcontara’s version of events, which was given at the earliest opportunity,
thereby eliminating any possibility of embellishment by Alcontara.
Alcontara might have lied to the police, but the omission to investigate by
the police had created a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. He was
denied the opportunity of having his defence fairly investigated by the police
investigation. That prejudice had occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice
against Alcontara. But, on the evidence as adduced before the learned JC, the
same cannot be said of the present appellant’s version regarding John. The



378

Current Law Journal

[2019] 3 CLJ

law report is replete with decisions on the Alcontara notice and if an example
is needed, then a case such as Ghasem Gharezadehsharbiani Hasan v. PP [2014]
1 LNS 752; [2014] 5 MLJ 433 would suffice to illustrate how such a defence
may be effectively erected by an accused person.
[27] It was also raised by learned counsel for the appellant that the
appellant was a mere simpleton who did the thing he did because he was
convinced to do it by DW2, his cousin. The plan was for him to bring the
bag to Kuching which would contain four pairs of jeans and two t-shirts for
business purposes. From the evidence surrounding this allegation, the
learned JC had found the submission by learned counsel on his contention
that the appellant was a simpleton to be a far-fetched proposition in light of
the not so simple journey that the appellant would have to undergo just to
bring four pairs of jeans and two t-shirts meant for business in Kuching
whereby he had to come all the way from Indonesia to Hong Kong for what
could be patently described as a simple transaction that ought not to require
such service involving the appellant having to come all the way from
Indonesia. On top of that he would be paid five million Indonesian Rupiah
for his effort with airplane ticket all paid for. The learned JC was not able
to accept the contention that the appellant was a mere simpleton. Suffice it
is for us to say that we agreed with the learned JC’s conclusion on the matter.
[28] A few other complaints in regard to the investigation were raised in
the written submissions advanced by learned counsel on behalf of the
appellant. Among them are the following:

(i) the data from the five hand phones seized that were not tendered by the

(ii) the missing monies and personal belongings of the appellant;
(iii) that the appellant’s hands were not swabbed;
(iv) that a fitting test was not conducted;
(v) that Eva was the actual trafficker and the appellant was an innocent
carrier; and

(vi) that the appellant and Eva did not carry or weigh the bag when it was
empty and examined its contents on the floor.
[29] Suffice for us to observe here that an investigation is left entirely to
the discretion of the investigating officer. Not all tools of investigation must
be applied in the course of an investigation depending on the real need for
such tool to be applied in order to establish a certain fact necessary to be
established. It would not be wrong to say that it depends on the experience
of the particular investigating officer. His ultimate vindication will take place
in the court where the sufficiency or otherwise of his investigative work will
be unravelled for all to see. As an illustration, we would allude to the apex

court’s decision in PP v. Mansor Md Rashid & Anor [1997] 1 CLJ 233 where
it was adverted by the apex Justices, no less, that in a case of drug transaction
involving an agent provocateur, it would not be imperative that finger printing
or nail clipping examination must be done on the accused person for obvious
reasons. In other words, where available evidence was already
overwhelming to connect the accused with the drugs seized, not all
investigative tools at the disposal must necessarily be applied to establish
such factual circumstance. It all would depend on the dictates of the situation
at hand confronting the investigating officer.
Our Findings

D

E

[30] As such, on the break in the chain of evidence issue, we were of the
respectful view that the learned JC was correct when he concluded that there
was no break in the chain of evidence.
[31] On the issue of whether the appellant was an innocent carrier, again
we agreed with the learned JC that the appellant was a trafficker, not an
innocent carrier.
[32] We also agreed with the learned JC that the prosecution had correctly
invoked the presumptions of possession and of trafficking of the said
impugned drugs and that the appellant had failed to rebut the said
presumptions on the balance of probabilities. He had also failed to raise a
reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
Conclusion

F

G

[33] In the upshot, premised on the above, we had unanimously dismissed
the appellant’s appeal. We were of the view that the evidence before the
learned JC was such that he was justified in concluding as he did that a case
beyond reasonable doubt had been established by the prosecution against the
appellant on the preferred charge of trafficking in dangerous drugs, to wit,
2,290g of methamphetamine. We therefore had affirmed both the conviction
entered against the appellant and the death sentence by hanging imposed on
the appellant by the learned JC in the High Court.
